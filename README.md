Caldron is an AI-assisted recipe development platform that allows users to generate and quickly iterate on new recipes. Caldron leverages multi-agent generative artificial intelligence tools to quickly iterate a desired foundational recipe from a provided prompt and optionally provided context. Caldron then provides channels for both human and machine sensory feedback to iteratively refine the recipe.
