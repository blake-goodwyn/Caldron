Make sure you have a bottom oven rack and a center oven rack in place for step 5. Grease an 8-inch round cake pan, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it’s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.) The cake WILL stick unless it’s lined and generously greased. (Trust me!), Cut the butter into pieces so it melts evenly. Place in a large heat-proof bowl. Add chopped chocolate. Melt in 20 second increments in the microwave, stirring after each increment until completely melted and smooth. Let cool for 2-3 minutes. You can use a double boiler for this step if desired., Whisk the sugar, espresso powder, and vanilla extract into the chocolate mixture. Whisk in the eggs until smooth. The mixture will be heavy and tacky, like brownie batter. Whisk in the cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder (if using)., Pour and spread batter into prepared cake pan., Prepare the steamy oven:, Place a large metal roasting pan or baking dish on the bottom oven rack. Do not use glass. Pour boiling water about 2 inches up the sides of the pan. (I just boil a kettle of water.) Quickly place the cake on the center rack and shut the oven door, trapping steam inside. The steamy oven helps guarantee an extra moist cake., Bake for 30 minutes until the edges are set. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean OR comes out with just a few moist crumbs. It’s important to not over-bake this cake, which dries it out. Begin checking it at 25 minutes. Don’t be alarmed if the cake rises extra tall around some of the edges and slightly cracks—this is normal (it’s the eggs expanding) and will flatten out as it cools., Remove from the oven, place cake on a cooling rack, and cool for only 10 minutes in the cake pan. Run a sharp knife around the edges to help release the warm cake, then quickly invert it onto a serving plate or cake stand. (If it cools completely in the pan, it’s very difficult to release from the pan.) Cake will be a little crumbly on the edges. Cool completely. I usually stick it in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours., Once the cake is cool, top with your choice of toppings. My suggestions are listed above this recipe. I love it with my mocha whipped cream., Mocha Whipped Cream, Using a fork, mix the espresso powder and warm water together in a very small bowl. Cool down for a few minutes. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream, sugar, cocoa powder, and espresso mixture on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 3-4 minutes. Medium peaks are between soft/loose peaks and stiff peaks and are the perfect consistency for topping and piping on desserts. Serve cake with whipped cream or pipe it on top.

Roll out to 1/4” (6mm) in thickness, turning the dough 45˚ often as you are rolling to keep it even. You want the circle to be slightly larger than your pie tin. Transfer to a 9” pie tin, and arrange to ensure that the dough is well settled., Trim the dough using scissors or a sharp knife, leaving about one inch excess around the edges. Gently tuck the dough under and onto itself, to give you a neat folded edge. Chill in the fridge for 15-20 minutes, then remove from the fridge and crimp as desired.

4ea1aa03,https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/best-ever-chocolate-brownies-recipe,Best ever chocolate brownies recipe,"185g unsalted butter, 185g best dark chocolate, 85g plain flour, 40g cocoa powder, 50g white chocolate, 50g milk chocolate, 3 large eggs, 275g golden caster sugar","Cut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl., Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them., Remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature., While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4., Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of kitchen foil (or non-stick baking parchment) to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps., Chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board., Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there., Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like., Hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly., Gently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing., Finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout., Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it., Put in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven., Leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil (or parchment). Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles., They’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.","[('butter', 185.0, 'g'), ('chocolate', 185.0, 'g'), ('flour', 85.0, 'g'), ('cocoa', 40.0, 'g'), ('chocolate', 50.0, 'g'), ('chocolate', 50.0, 'g'), ('eggs', 3.0, None), ('caster sugar', 275.0, 'g')]"

I baked for 28 minutes total., I recommend baking 25 minutes, checking with a toothpick, and baking for up to 5 more minutes, as necessary. Do not bake over 30 minutes or brownies will be prone to scorching, burning, turning dry, or setting up too hard. Brownies will firm up as they cool. I recommend cooling brownies on counter in the pan for 1 hour, covering pan with a piece of foil (to prevent fridge smells) and placing pan in refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or overnight, to cool completely before slicing if you want clean-cuts because they're so fudgy; using a pizza wheel may help if brownies are sticking to your knife., Brownies will keep in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. I prefer them chilled and keep them in the fridge.

Line a 24cm square baking tin with baking paper – leave long edges so you have a handle to pull the brownies out., In a small saucepan, melt and brown the butter until the flecks are a deep brown colour. It should smell nutty and fragrant but not acrid or burnt., Pour the butter into the bowl of your kitchen mixer with the whisk attachment. Add the sugars to the bowl, and whisk until they’re just combined. It should look like light brown wet sand at this point. Once combined, turn off the mixer and allow the butter to cool a little., Half fill the small saucepan you used to brown the butter with water (saves on dishes!) pop a metal bowl on top, and place it over a low –medium heat. It should not touch water – this could burn the chocolate and make it seize up. Melt the chocolate until completely smooth before removing from the heat., Turn the mixer onto a medium high speed (I used speed 5 on a Kitchenaid) and add the eggs, one at a time. Stop to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, before returning to a medium high speed. Quite quickly, the mixture should lighten in colour and take on a meringue like appearance and texture. It will be a light brown colour with a sheen to it. Beat the mixture for around 3 minutes or until it is visibly light and fluffy. I have had my mixture split before at this point, and although I haven’t figured out specifically why, it won’t ruin the brownies so you can proceed as normal if this happens., While the mixer is running, add the cocoa and boiling water to the melted chocolate. Use a spatula to JUST combine – any more and the mixture will stiffen. Boiling water is used to bloom the cocoa and give a more pronounced chocolate flavour., Lower the speed of the mixer and add in the chocolate mixture. Whisk on a lower speed until totally combined. Turn the mixer off to add the sourdough discard, salt and vanilla bean paste – the paste gets stuck in the whisk if it’s moving., Whisk again to combine before removing the bowl from the stand. Pour the brownie batter into the prepared tin and tap it on the bench a few times to remove any excess air bubbles., Place the brownie in the oven for 20 minutes – this produces an incredibly fudgy brownie. You can cook it a little longer if you prefer your brownie more well done., As per the notes, I suggest making brownies the night before and allowing them to totally cool, on the bench or in the fridge.

Stir until you no longer see streaks of flour in the batter., Spread the brownie batter evenly in the prepared pan., Bake the brownies until the edges look dry and the middle looks slightly underbaked; 35 to 45 minutes.

We're dealing with two boxes worth of brownies plus an entire bag of fun size Twix here because we're either insane or enjoy flirting with the threat of diabetes. Anyway, I baked mine for 45-50 minutes (it was a team effort so we had trouble remembering the exact timing.), To make the frosting, add the softened butter, sugar, cocoa powder, salt, and vanilla to the bowl of a stand mixer. Begin to mix on the lowest speed until it seems to become less powdery and more like clumps., Slowly pour in the coffee until you're sure the contents of the bowl aren't going to fly out at you and then let it rip. Crank the mixer up to high and whip the hell out of it until it's completely fluffy and a yummy light brown color., Spread the frosting evenly over the slightly or completely cooled brownies. I had ants in my pants to get these in the fridge to set, so my brownies were still a little warm when I added the mocha goodness. It didn't seem to make such a big difference. The butter in the frosting started melting just a bit, but not enough to cause problems. As long as you're popping it in the fridge to set, the main thing is getting that yummy layer all over the top., When you're ready to get crazy with some decadence, make sure to run your knife under hot water and wipe dry in between each cut. This should ensure that you get nice clean slices and keep the frosting from gooping up on your knife., Here's another picture of the same stack of brownies just because I couldn't stop taking pictures... or eating them., Seriously.

It really doesn't take a lot of time though.), Pour 1 cup sugar into a medium saucepan and heat to medium-high. Using a rubber spatula, stir the sugar just occasionally, scraping the bottom of the pan. At first the sugar will be lumpy, but will soon melt and start turning brown. Don't stir too often, just enough to keep everything evenly cooking. After about 5 minutes, the sugar should be fully melted and become a rich amber color., At this point, remove the pan from the heat and immediately add 6 Tablespoons butter. The mixture will start to bubble quite rapidly. That's just what you want., Using your spatula or a whisk, stir the butter and sugar until they melt together almost completely. This can take 1-2 minutes., Next, pour in ½ cup heavy whipping cream and 1-1 ½ teaspoons sea salt. If you're making regular caramel, then add ½ teaspoon salt and no more. If you're making a salted caramel version, add anywhere from 1 teaspoon to 1 ½ teaspoons depending on your liking., Stir constantly now until the sauce is all mixed together and is smooth. Place back on the stove at medium-high heat again for about 20 seconds more. Remember to keep stirring., Remove from heat and serve immediately for a hot option over ice cream or let cool at least 15 minutes for room temperature use., Over several minutes, the caramel will become harder to stir. For a manageable sauce, just heat in microwave for 10-15 seconds and stir again., Make the Brownies:, While the caramel is cooling, preheat oven to 350F degrees. Very lightly, butter an 8""x8"" baking dish. Now cut two 8""x 16"" pieces of parchment paper. Place one piece in the dish with edges coming up the sides. Very lightly butter the bottom of that piece of paper (this is so the second piece will adhere to it). Place the second sheet of parchment paper in dish coming up the other sides of the dish. Again, very lightly butter the parchment so all surfaces the brownies will touch are covered (I can't stress enough, use a light hand). Set aside., In a medium bowl or stand mixer bowl, stir together 12 Tablespoons melted butter and 1 ½ cups sugar until mixed well. Add 2 eggs, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, ½ teaspoon salt and optional 1 teaspoon coffee, mixing on medium speed of the stand mixer or quickly by hand. Once combined fold in ¾ cup cocoa powder and ½ cup flour. If using, toss in ½ cup bittersweet chocolate chips., Cook's Note:, The chocolate chips make this doubly chocolatey and are delicious, but your brownies will be SUPER gooey., Pour about halve the brownie batter into the baking dish, spreading evenly to the edges and up the sides of the pan a little., Pour ½ cup (more or less, depending on your liking) of the salted caramel over the brownie batter, spreading evenly but not quite to the edges., Spoon the rest of the brownie batter over the top, sealing as much of the caramel in as you can., Bake the brownies at 350F degrees for 30 minutes. Then decrease temperature to 325F degrees and continue baking for an additional 10 minutes or until a knife insterted in the center comes out clean. Reducing the heat for the last few minutes helps the brownies to bake evenly from edges to center without the edges getting over-cooked., Remove from oven and allow to cool completely (about 1 hour).

I actually recommend slicing these on day two (keep them loosely covered at room temperature once cooled) because the texture improves. When freshly sliced, the center pieces could feel slightly greasy (see notes for more) but by the next day, they're perfect. Chilling the brownies for about 30 minutes before slicing also helps with neater pieces., Brownies can be stored at room temperature in an airtight tin for 4 to 5 days (if it's hot or humid, then about 2 to 3 days at room temperature is best), or in the fridge for about 10 days where they will be extra fudgy.

This truly makes all the difference in baking results. Just follow my gram weights listed, as this is how my recipes are tested. Add the bowl to the scale, hit zero and add each ingredient, hitting zero in between., I use this scale.","PLEASE READ the instructions so your brownies turn out correctly. The steps to adding the batter to the pan, as well as the cooling and chilling step are crucial to setting these., Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and lightly grease an 8x8 square stone ceramic pan. I like stone here because it keeps the brownies really moist and the edges don't burn. But if you only have glass or metal, just keep an eye on the edges., Make sure the edges are greased and any excess dripping oil is gently wiped off. Now cut off a square piece of parchment paper that will lie flat on the inside bottom of the pan. This will help prevent any sticking to the bottom of the pan and make for very easy removal later., To a large bowl, add the almond butter, syrup and peppermint extract. Stir for a good minute or so until completely and thoroughly mixed. You want to make sure that extract is mixed through., To a medium bowl, combine the flaxseed, cornstarch, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Whisk very well., Add the dry ingredients to the wet. Add the chocolate chips and then stir the mixture together slowly with a large spoon until it comes together into a cohesive, very thick and sticky chocolate batter. It will be very thick like pictured, almost like a cookie batter, this is normal. It will not be pourable or runny., Spoon the batter onto the prepared baking dish. It will be very thick and sticky and not easy to spread. Use your fingers to pat it down as best you can and then take a piece of parchment paper to flatten it out. Now the key next step, dip your fingers repeatedly in water to go around the brownie batter and smooth the top completely out and evenly across the top and along the edges, as pictured in the post. This step is important so the batter is even and spread out and bakes evenly. Having wet fingertips makes it much easier to spread out the batter., Bake for 22 to possibly 25 minutes, depending on your oven. Mine were perfect at exactly 23 minutes. They will be puffed up, have a dry shiny top, but you will know they are done when you insert a toothpick in the middle and there may be a few sticky crumbs, not actual runny batter, on it. Do not overbake them. Check at 22 minutes. If it's a tad too wet with runny batter, go another minute until it's sticky crumbs or almost clean., While the brownies are baking, get the crushed peppermints ready, as you will need to sprinkle them on the top as soon as you remove the brownies from the oven. To crush them, either blend them up in a Vitamix or food processor so they are very tiny pieces or a powder. I left some chunks for presentation purposes in photos, but they were a bit too big to eat like that, so I suggest making them very small. You can also add them to a ziplock bag and pound them., As soon as the brownies come out of the oven, sprinkle the crushed peppermints on top all over and gently press them in. The heat will slightly melt them, making them stick as they cool., Here are the cooling instructions you do not want to skip! Leave to cool in the pan for 30 minutes. Then place the whole pan in the fridge for just another 30 minutes. I don't care how hard it is to wait, it will create the most fudgy, perfectly dense and set texture that will make them easy to slice and remove. Remove from the fridge and use a sharp knife to slice into 16 brownies. Enjoy! You can keep them at room temperature for a softer brownie or the fridge for a firmer brownie, keeping in mind they harden and dry out quicker in the fridge.

Brush 10 of the muffin tins with some of the melted butter and dust with cocoa powder. (The cleanest way to do this is to place about a tablespoon of cocoa powder in each tin, and, holding it over a large sheet of parchment paper, knock it around to the best of your ability, tapping out the excess onto the parchment. Use the parchment to slide the extra cocoa into your measuring cup for the cake.), In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the eggs and sugar with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until very thick and pale, 5 - 10 minutes. When you lift the paddle from the bowl, the egg goop should form a mound on the surface of the goop in the bowl for a second before disappearing., While the eggs are doing their thing, sift together the cocoa, flour and salt into a medium bowl., Beat the vanilla into the egg mixture. With the mixer on the lowest speed, add 1/3 of the dry mixture, beating until combined. With the mixer still running, drizzle in 1/2 of the warm, melted butter, mixing until combined (slowly drizzling in the butter ensures that it emulsifies into the eggs, resulting in a smooth, not greasy, texture). Keep going like that until all the stuff is in there. Remove the bowl from the mixer and fold in the chopped chocolate. The batter should be fairly runny and shiny, like that of brownie batter., Immediately divide the batter among the buttered and cocoa-ed muffin cups (a spring-loaded ice cream scoop makes quick work of this), filling them about 2/3 of the way full. Bake the cakes, rotating once, until shiny on top and a tester comes out with lots of moist crumbs (there may be melted chocolate from the chunks on there, too - don't let it fool you), about 20 minutes. Let the cakes cool for 5 minutes. Invert a cooling rack over the cakes, then grab the pan and the rack and flip everything over together. Give the pan a rap on the table, then remove it, so that the cakes are sitting upside-down on the rack. Turn the cakes over to cool right-side-up., To serve, dust the cakes with powdered sugar. Drizzle the blood orange reduction on plates, and place a warm cake atop each plate. Make a small pile of cocoa nibs next to or on top of the cakes, and top with a scoop of ice cream. Garnish the ice cream with ground black pepper, a few flecks of flaky salt and a few cocoa nibs., The cakes will keep for up to 5 days in an airtight container at room temperature. Reheat in a 350º oven for 3 - 5 minutes before serving., Vanilla-Black Pepper Ice Cream, In a medium saucepan, heat the half and half with the vanilla bean and scrapings until steaming and small bubbles appear around the sides of the pan. Cover and steep for 20 minutes., Pour the heavy cream into a quart-sized container, such as a mason jar, and set aside. If you have an instant-read thermometer, have it handy., Place the egg yolks in a medium bowl set on a damp towel to stabilize it. Add the sugar and salt, whisking to combine. Reheat the half and half to a bare scald. Whisking constantly with one hand, pour the hot dairy very slowly into the yolks. (This is called tempering, and prevents the yolks from scrambling.) Pour the mixture back into the pot and set over a medium-low flame. Cook, stirring constantly with a heat-proof rubber spatula, scraping the sides and bottom of the pot, until the custard just begins to 'stick' (or form a thickened film) on the bottom of the pot (you will have to tilt the pan to see the bottom), or registers 170º on an instant-read thermometer, 5-10 minutes., Immediately pour the custard into the container of cold cream, stir to combine, and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight., Place the ice cream base in the freezer for 30 minutes, stirring 2 - 3 times, to get it really cold. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve, and stir in the black pepper, then process in an ice cream maker. 'Cure' in the freezer for at least 2 hours for a firmer, scoopable consistency., Homemade ice cream is best eaten within the first few days of being made, but will keep for a month or two in the freezer., Blood Orange Reduction, Combine the juice and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat.

Add 2 cans evaporated milk, 2 cups sugar and 2 tablespoons of butter., 3. Whisk it together and get it on the stove. Over medium high heat bring it to a boil while you stir it constantly. Don't worry if it looks kind of weird and clumpy at first. As the ingredients warm up they will meld together nicely for you. Once you have reached a boil allow the mixture to simmer while you stir for 1-2 minutes to allow it to thicken up., 4. Remove from the heat and add 2 tablespoons butter, 2 teaspoons vanilla and a dash of salt. Allow the butter to melt and then stir it well. If you are making this in advance allow it to come to room temperature and then store it in the refrigerator. Reheat it over the stove top and then place it in a crock pot to serve., 5. Scoop a nice cool portion of ice cream onto each brownie and drizzle the warm hot fudge over the top., For Mark's Eagle Court of Honor, I kept the hot fudge warm in a crock pot to serve. Several of my friends offered to scoop ice cream. We served Mint Chocolate Chip (which was the most popular and first to be devoured), Cookies and Cream and Vanilla.","[('eggs', 8, None), ('sugar', 4.0, 'c'), ('vanilla', 4.0, 'tsp'), ('salt', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('butter', 2.0, 'c'), ('flour', 3.0, 'c'), ('cocoa powder', 1.5, 'c'), ('cornstarch', 3.5, 'tb'), ('cocoa powder', 2.0, 'tb'), ('evaporated milk', 2.0, '12 ounce cans'), ('sugar', 2.0, 'c'), ('butter', 4.0, 'tb'), ('vanilla', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('salt', None), ('ice cream', 1.0, 'gallons')]"

Using a wooden spoon or heat-resistant spatula, gently stir the sugar and water until the mixture starts to simmer., Once the mixture starts to simmer, leave it alone but watch it closely. Measure the cream out, warm it up in a separate pot if it's cold to minimise splattering., Do not stir, but if the sugar isn't melting evenly, it's okay to give the pot a very gentle and slow swivel. The sugar will go from pale yellow, to golden syrup yellow. Once it's yellow, be on a standby and watch the pot closely - have your coconut cream, a stirring spoon and a thermometer (ideally) ready., Once the caramel reaches red amber colour, allow it to go dark amber (not too much as it will be bitter) and pour in coconut milk while stirring gently.

Line a 9x13 inch baking pan with parchment paper. You can also line it with aluminum foil (be sure to spray the foil with nonstick spray). Or you can just spray the pan., In a medium pot (I use a 3 quart saucepan), melt 1 and 1/4 cups of butter over medium heat. Yes, 1 and 1/4 cup. I called these the best brownies of all time, not healthy brownies!, Stir the butter occasionally. See photos for how to brown butter. It will turn white on top, then it will foam up. Once it is foamy, it will start forming brown colored milk solids or ""bits"". They will swirl up when you stir. The scent of the butter will change to a ""nutty"" or toffee like aroma. Once you see brown bits, remove the pan from the heat. Do not stop cooking the butter until it is completely browned, see note., Immediately add 4 ounces of unsweetened baking chocolate. Break it up into pieces so that they melt faster. Stir until it is melted all the way., Add 2 and 1/2 cups sugar and stir it together. If there are still bits of chocolate that have not melted, put it back on the burner on low until it is smooth., Add 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon water, and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Stir it together., Whisking vigorously so they don't curdle in the hot batter, stir in the eggs one at a time, making sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next one. I highly recommend an actual whisk for this step; a wooden spoon won't break up the egg whites as well., Add 1 cup all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled. That means take a large spoon and add flour to your measuring cup, then level off the top with something flat like a butter knife. Stir in the flour with a wooden spoon until just barely incorporated., Do not over mix. Over-mixed batter makes for a tough brownie, which is not what we're going for. You want soft, tender brownies! Once you don't see any more flour streaks, stop messing with it., Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and spread to the edges., Sprinkle 1 and 1/4 cups chocolate chips evenly over the batter. Use your spatula to gently fold it in. If you add the chocolate chips to the batter before pouring it into the pan, they tend to melt and swirl on you. Which might be okay with you. I prefer my chocolate to stay in chip form so that when you bite into a brownie you get tiny little pools of chocolate. Mmm., Bake at 350 for about 25-30 minutes. The edges should be set. The center of the pan should not wobble when you shake it. I always do the toothpick test: poke a toothpick in the center of the brownies and if there is no wet batter sticking to it, it's done. (If there is, leave it in for a couple more minutes) Be sure to poke a couple times so that you know you're not poking into a melted chocolate chip. Every oven is different, so you are going to have to use your best judgment here on the bake time! Do NOT over bake, or the brownies will be too dry. In my opinion, slightly under baked is better than over baked. Keep in mind that the brownies will firm up as they cool., When the brownies are done, remove from the oven and let cool as long as you can before giving in and trying a piece. If you need them to look nice, you need to let them set up in the pan for at LEAST 15-30 minutes., To cut these into nice looking squares, once the brownies have cooled, lift the parchment paper or foil out of the pan.

Stir in the chocolate chips., You can use homemade coconut butter or store-bought. I like the MaraNatha brand. Regarding the coconut butter...before adding, it needs to be the consistency of oil, as pictured. It should be 100% smooth and runny. Just make sure it is melted and in complete liquid form when measuring 3/4 cup. The jars at the store will be solid, so the best way to work with this is to take off the lid, heat up the jar in the microwave for 15-30 seconds or so, just until it becomes soft enough to scoop it all out into a separate container. I find this is the best way to stir it and mix up the separated coconut meat and oil and totally smooth, as well as storing it this way for future use. After adding it to the container, heat a few more seconds if needed to soften it just until you can stir it a bit until it all comes together, is runny and smooth. See pic in post. Be very careful about overheating coconut butter or it will burn it and make it mealy., Add the liquid coconut butter to a separate bowl, then the room temperature syrup, almond butter, vanilla and stir until very smooth and well mixed. It is important that the other liquids are at room temperature, because if they are cold, it can cause the coconut butter to separate., Now, pour the liquid into the dry ingredients and stir until well combined.

You'll work with bowls A through D in-order. Bowl B should be your largest bowl, since it will end up holding all of the ingredients., Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.Prepare your baking pan: I use a 9"" x 13"" pan so that my brownies are the thickness I require for my version of ""perfection."" If you like thinner brownies, use a larger pan so that the batter can be spread thin.Take a pat of butter and use your fingers to spread it over every inch of the inside of the pan. Do yourself a favor and dust with unsweetened cocoa powder, like I do. Dusting the pan with flour tends to leave a bitter aftertaste on the outside of the brownie crust. I recommend dusting all baked chocolate desserts, with chocolate instead of flour.Now, let's prepare the first ingredients we'll work with, to make a chocolate sauce., Create a double-broiler to melt the ingredients together. Place 1-2 inches of water into a saucepan. Place on medium-low heat. Once you see tiny bubbles forming in the water, it's time to place the glass bowl (A) onto the top.The trick to melting/tempering chocolate is to be sure additional moisture is not added, while it's over a heat source. Therefore, I recommend always using a baking spatula and not a wood spoon (since wood retains moisture) to mix while melting.Use the spatula to coat the chocolate with the butter. After about 4 minutes, the water will increase in heat and start to boil. At that point, bring the heat down to low. Continue turning the chocolate. It will take approximately 10 minutes total, to melt the chocolate to become completely smooth., Remove the bowl from heat, and set this aside to cool. Before mixing in the rest of the ingredients, the chocolate sauce should cool for 10 minutes. Since the rest of this recipe will fly-by, I recommend setting a timer so you know when to move onto the next steps., Again, this should be the largest bowl, since all of the contents will end up here.Place the sugar, eggs, pure vanilla extract (and if you're using it, the fresh-brewed espresso). Use a spatula to break it down and mix it together. There's no need to whisk or beat.Next, pour the cooled, melted chocolate of BOWL A, into the egg and sugar mixture of BOWL B.Mix together. You'll notice how the texture changes, into a thickened mixture, that gives resistance against the spatula. Once the chocolate is incorporated, add the dry ingredients from BOWL C. It won't take long to combine. Last, you'll add the ingredients from BOWL D. Mix just enough, until there are no traces of white from the flour. Pour the batter into the prepared pan., Place the pan at the center rack of your oven. For this size pan, the brownies are done after 35 minutes. Take out at this time. Don't over cook or allow for dark-browning/burning at the edge or top. A couple specs of dark at the top are perfectly fine. Allow to cool. It will take time for the rise in the center to flatten. Once it's flat, you can cut and serve, or put the pan in the refrigerator to cut and serve when you are ready.

Refrigerate it for 30 minutes (or 15 minutes in the freezer)., In the meantime preheat the oven to 355F/180C and grease the sides and bottom of a 8-inch round pie dish (with removable bottom)., Dust the countertop with a bit of cocoa powder and roll out the dough to a 3 mm/ ⅛ inch thickness., To transfer the dough to the pie dish lift up the dough with a wide spatula and slide the greased bottom of the pie dish under it. Now fold the 'overhang' towards the center of the pie bottom so all the dough is supported by the bottom and it can't break off. Transport it to the pie dish and once it is in, fold back the extra dough (so now it is draped over the sides of the pie dish)., Try not to press down the dough (too much) and only use a fork to make a few holes in the bottom to prevent air bubbles to pop up while baking., Use a rolling pin to cut off the extra dough that is hanging over the edge by rolling it over the top. See picture in the text above to see how., To blind bake the pie crust, add baking beans (or other type of baking weights) to the pie dish, but not before you have lined the dough with parchment paper so the beans don't stick to the pie crust., Bake for 15 minutes with the baking beans and after removing the baking beans and parchment paper bake for another 10 minutes. Once reading, take the pie crust out of the oven, but leave the oven on., Let the pie crust cool off. In the meantime continue with the brownie batter., Baking the brownie batter in the pre-baked pie crust, Start by melting the chocolate and coconut oil for the brownie batter in a double boiler (au bain marie). Once it is fully melted and incorporated, take it off the heat and set it aside to slightly cool off., In the meantime use a hand mixer to whisk the eggs and sugar together until fully and tripled in size (this usually takes me around 5-6 minutes)., Once the egg mixture is fluffy, slowly pour in the melted chocolate mixture while whisking on low speed until the chocolate is fully incorporated., Sift the flour, cocoa powder and salt into the egg-chocolate mixture and gently fold in the dry ingredients, using a spatula, until no clumps remain., Lastly, quickly stir in the dark chocolate chunks. Make sure not to over mix it., Pour the batter into the pre-baked pie crust. Place the pie in the preheated oven in the center of the middle rack., Bake the pie for 28-33 minutes. This pie is best when still gooey in the middle. So don't wait until a tooth pick comes out dry with just a few crumbs attached to it. Rather take it out when the top is solid and a tooth pick comes out with a thick cluster of gooey batter attached to it. (If you are not into gooey brownies then at least don't wait longer than when the tooth pick comes out with very moist crumbs attached to it)., Take the pie out of the oven and let it cool off just a little bit.

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. Line three half sheet pans with parchment paper., Melt the chocolate. Place the chocolate in the top pan of a double boiler or in a heatproof bowl set over a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan filled with a few inches of simmering water (be sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water).Cook over medium heat, using a heatproof rubber spatula to stir the mixture and scrape the sides of the bowl occasionally, until the chocolate is melted, about 5 to 10 minutes.

Two crucial elements in the success of the brownies include stirring “energetically” and stirring for one full minute – your bicep/shoulder will likely be burning. Batter may appear to separate a few second into stirring, and it may appear grainy midway through, but when you stir with vigor for a full 60 seconds, you’ll end up with a batter that’s rich, thick, satiny smooth, and glossy. Therein lies the difference between dry, crumbly brownies and the amazing ones., Turn batter out into prepared pan and smooth the top lightly with a spatula or knife., Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the center is almost set; do not overbake. 28-29 minutes is perfect in my oven, but ovens and personal preference varies. A toothpick inserted in the center should come out with a few moist crumbs, but no batter., Allow brownies to cool in pan on a wire rack for about 1 hour. Cover with a sheet of foil to prevent freezer smells and place pan in the freezer for at least 2 hours, or until brownies are very firm or frozen., Remove sorbet from freezer about 30 minutes before using it so it can soften at room temp., Remove brownies from freezer, lift them out using foil overhang, and put slab on a large cutting board. With a large knife, cut slab in half. Even though brownies are cold/frozen, it’s possible to slice them with firm pressure, using caution. Or, wait 5-10 minutes for brownies to soften slightly if slicing is too difficult straight from freezer. You want brownies cold so that when you’re pushing and spreading the sorbet, the brownies don’t become squished., Using a knife or spatula, add the sorbet to one brownie slab in an even, flat layer, smoothing it as best you can with knife or spatula. Top with other brownie slab and place giant sandwich in freezer for at least 2 hours, or until sorbet has set up., Place giant sandwich slab on cutting board and using caution, slice into 8 sandwiches, each 1-inch wide and 4-inches long, or preferred size/shape.

Heat for 90 seconds at 50% power, stirring halfway through. Stir again until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. A few pieces at a time, gently stir in butter until each addition is melted. This takes 5 to 10 minutes. If the chocolate cools so much that the butter will barely melt, microwave for 30 seconds at 50% power. After adding all the butter, stir until mixture is completely smooth. If using, stir in triple sec. Cool about 20 minutes (to about 90 degrees F), so the glaze is pourable but has thickened slightly., Pour 1/4 cup glaze over brownie, spreading evenly with the back of a spoon, almost to the edge. This layer will fill any cracks in the brownie, so it’s okay if crumbs appear in it. Refrigerate glazed brownie, uncovered, 10 minutes. Pour about 2/3 cup (or to desired thickness) of remaining glaze over the first layer, again spreading evenly with the back of a spoon. Allow to set at room temperature or more quickly in the refrigerator before serving. If making ahead, refrigerate the brownie, covering with plastic wrap after the glaze has set., Whipped cream, Best prepared immediately before serving. Chill a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer for 10 minutes. Turn refrigerated cans of coconut milk upside down and open from bottom. Pour off separated, semi-translucent liquid (reserve for smoothies). Scoop firm, white milk into chilled bowl. Beat with handheld electric mixer or the whisk attachment of your stand mixer until fluffy, about 5 minutes at 60 to 80% power. Add sugar, vanilla, and zest, and whip again until incorporated and sugar dissolves. To serve, pile all the cream onto the brownie (for a dramatic look), cut, and serve. Alternatively, if not serving all at once, scoop cream onto individual slices of brownie.

Once it's cooled, you can remove the cake from the pan and cover it in plastic wrap to refrigerate for one day, unless you are serving it the same day.If you'd like to decorate the flourless chocolate cake with fresh berries, so that it looks more like a torte, I recommend drizzling the top of the cake with fresh ganache., Making Chocolate Ganache, Place the chocolate chips or cut chocolate pieces in a large bowl.Heat the whipping cream in a saucepan, at medium heat, until small bubbles form around the edge of the cream.Pour the warm heavy cream over the chocolate. Allow to sit for about 30 seconds. Whisk the ingredients for about 2 minutes, by hand. The end result is gorgeous, glossy ganache. You can save the extra ganache in an sealed container and refrigerate for up to five days., Finishing and decorating your cake, After the ganache is drizzled, I placed fresh berries and dusted the entire cake with powdered sugar. It's easy to serve, and because it's so decadent, a little slice goes a long way.","[('butter', 1.0, 'cup'), ('chocolate chips', 18.0, 'ounces'), ('water', 0.25, 'cup'), ('eggs', 6.0, None), ('sugar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('cocoa powder', 0.25, 'cup'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('heavy whipping cream', 2.0, 'cups'), ('chocolate', 3.0, 'cups')]"
