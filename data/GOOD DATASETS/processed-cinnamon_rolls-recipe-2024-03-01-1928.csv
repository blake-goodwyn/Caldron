I like to do this by placing milk in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving it for 40-45 seconds. It should be like warm bath water. Transfer warm milk to the bowl of an electric mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Add in sugar, egg, egg yolk and melted butter. Mix until well combined. Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form., Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it's TOO sticky (meaning it's sticking to the bottom of the mixer, add in 2 tablespoons more bread flour.) If you don’t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface., Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour to 1 ½ hours, or until doubled in size. This may more or less time depending the humidity and temperature in your home., After dough has doubled in size, transfer dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a 14x9 inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over dough, leaving a ¼ inch margin at the far side of the dough., In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter., Tightly roll dough up, starting from the 9-inch side and place seam side down making sure to seal the edges of the dough as best you can. You will probably need to cut off about an inch off the ends of the dough as the ends won’t be as full of cinnamon sugar as we’d want it to be., Cut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife or floss. You should get 9 large pieces., Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x9 inch baking pan or round 9 inch cake pan. (I also recommend lining the pan with parchment paper as well, in case any of the filling ends up leaking out.) Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30-45 minutes., Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. You want to underbake them a little so they stay soft in the middle, that’s why we want them just slightly golden brown. Allow them to cool for 5-10 minutes before frosting. Makes 9 cinnamon rolls., To make the frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth and fluffy. Spread over cinnamon rolls and serve immediately.

Set aside., Combine the milk and butter together in a heatproof bowl. Microwave or use the stove and heat until the butter has melted and the mixture is warm to the touch (about 110°F/43°C, no higher). Whisk in the yeast until it has dissolved. Pour mixture into the dry ingredients, add the egg, and stir with a sturdy rubber spatula or wooden spoon OR use a stand mixer with a paddle attachment on medium speed. Mix until a soft dough forms., Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Using floured hands, knead the dough for 3-5 minutes. You should have a smooth ball of dough. If the dough is super soft or sticky, you can add a little more flour. Place in a lightly greased bowl (I use non-stick spray), cover loosely, and let the dough rest for about 10 minutes as you get the filling ingredients ready., Fill the rolls:, After 10 minutes, roll the dough out in a 14×8-inch (36×20-cm) rectangle. Spread the softened butter on top. Mix together the cinnamon and brown sugar. Sprinkle it all over the dough. Roll up the dough to make a 14-inch log. Cut into 10–12 even rolls and arrange in a lightly greased 9- or 10-inch round cake pan, pie dish, or square baking pan., Rise, Cover the pan with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the rolls to rise in a relatively warm environment for 60–90 minutes or until double in size. (For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), Bake the rolls, After the rolls have doubled in size, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake for 24–27 minutes, or until lightly browned. If you notice the tops are getting too brown too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil and continue baking. If you want to be precise about their doneness, their internal temperature taken with an instant read thermometer should be around 195–200°F (91–93°C) when done. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack as you make the icing. (You can also make the icing as the rolls bake.), Make the icing, In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on high speed until smooth and creamy. Add the butter and beat until smooth and combined, then beat in the confectioners’ sugar and vanilla until combined. Using a knife or icing spatula, spread the icing over the warm rolls and serve immediately., Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.","[('flour', 344.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 50.0, 'g'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('milk', 180.0, 'ml'), ('butter', 43.0, 'g'), ('yeast', 2.25, 'teaspoons'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('brown sugar', 67.0, 'g'), ('cinnamon', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('cream cheese', 113.0, 'g'), ('confectioners sugar', 80.0, 'g'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'teaspoon')]"

Heat in the microwave for 30 sec – 45 sec, until warm to the touch but not hot. The butter will not melt completely., Pour into the dry ingredients with the egg and mix with a wooden spoon., Add in 2 more cups of flour and mix. It should turn pretty thick and sticky at this point., Add in 1/2 cup of flour and mix again. It should now turn shaggy and become difficult to stir. Once it reaches that point, set the spoon to the side and use your hands to mix and knead the dough., It will be sticky, so add another 1/4 cup of flour and continue to mix and knead by hand. It should turn into a smooth mass that’s soft and tacky., With a clean finger, press it into the dough. If your finger is sticking, add another 1/4 cup of flour and knead. If it’s not, then shape it into a ball and let it rest uncovered for 10 minutes., When the 10 minutes is up, the dough should have puffed up quite a bit but not quite doubled in size., Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and pat it into a rough rectangle shape. Roll it into a 10×15 inch rectangle using a rolling pin., Spread the room temperature butter into a thin and even layer, leaving about 1/2 inch border all around the outside of the dough., Sprinkle with the brown sugar and spread it even with your hand. Then top it with the cinnamon., Working from the 15 inch end of the dough, roll it up into a log. Place your hands at each end of the log and give it a gentle squeeze in to compact the log of dough. It may have stretched out a bit during the rolling process so this brings it back together., For best results, use unflavored dental floss to cut the rolls. If you don’t have floss, you could also use really thin sewing thread. If using a sharp knife, gently saw back and forth and try not to press straight down into the rolls. This will squish them into an odd shape., Using the floss, slide it under the roll and toss both ends of the floss over top. Pull them through to create a cut. Cut off the two ends of the log and then cut the remainder into 12 pieces., Cut the entire log in half, then cut those two halves in half to create 4 segments. Cut each of those 4 segments into 3 rolls to get a total of 12., Place the rolls in a buttered or greased 9×13 dish (you could also use two 9″ round pans, placing 6 rolls in each). It’s OK if all of the rolls are touching. *See notes for overnight instructions, Place in a warm spot and cover with a towel to rise for 1 hour. If you live in a colder climate, preheat the oven to the lowest temperature. Once it’s ready, turn the oven off and place the rolls inside. This creates a warm environment for the rolls to proof., Preheat the oven to 350F (first remove the rolls if you proofed them inside) and check on the rolls. They should have doubled in size and now take up the entire dish., Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the tops are a light golden brown. While they cool, make the icing., Cream Cheese Icing, Place the cream cheese and butter in a bowl and use a fork to mash the two together. Make sure they’re both softened to room temperature, otherwise the icing will be lumpy., Add the powdered sugar and vanilla and mash again with the fork.

It should be warm but not hot to the touch (about 105 degrees F)., Place milk into the bowl of your standing mixer, then add 1 TBS sugar and 1 TBS yeast to the warm milk. Stir and let it sit (proof) for five minutes or until it becomes foamy., Add the ½ cup sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla to the mixture in the bowl of your standing mixer. Use a dough hook to stir until combined, Add 4 cups flour, salt and cinnamon and stir the dough hook, starting on low and increasing to high., Knead dough in the standing mixer until a large ball is formed. The dough should be smooth and only slightly tacky to the touch. If the dough seems too sticky and is not forming a ball, add more flour 1 TBS at a time until a smooth ball is formed., Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead with your hands until it is smooth and elastic (about 3-5 minutes). Form it into a ball., Grease a large bowl and place the dough inside., Cover the bowl with a warm, damp towel and put the bowl in a warm place to rise., Let the dough rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until dough has doubled in size., Make the Filling, While the dough is rising, make the filing. In a small bowl, combine butter, brown sugar and cinnamon until mixture is homogenous (uniform throughout). Set aside., Alternately, you can combine the cinnamon and sugar. Then melt the butter and brush it on the rolled dough, then sprinkle the cinnamon sugar on the butter-brushed dough. (I think this way is easier)!, Assemble the Cinnamon Rolls, Sprinkle a large work surface with flour., Gently press the gas out of the dough and form it into a rectangle., Roll the dough into a 24x12” rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick., Spread the filling all over the dough using greased hands or a greased spatula. This process can seem difficult but it gets easier as you spread it. (Alternately: if you only combined the cinnamon and sugar, then melt the butter and use a pastry brush to spread the melted butter all over the dough. Then sprinkle the dough with cinnamon sugar and pat it down gently to insure it sticks)., Roll up dough cut into 12 equal sized rolls (feel free to measure and cut each roll to be 2” long)., Line a 9x13 inch glass baking dish with parchment paper and lightly grease. Then place rolls in 4 rows of three, evenly spaced., Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes., Bake, Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F., Once rolls are doubled in size, bake them in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20-25 minutes. They will rise more in the oven. (NOTE: Check the center cinnamon rolls and make sure they are baked through. If your oven bakes cool or unevenly you may need to increase the baking time up to 10 minutes longer. If the top starts to brown before the center is baked, tent the baking pan with foil to prevent further browning)., Make the Cream Cheese Frosting, While rolls are baking, beat together cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract and salt. Do not chill the frosting. Keep it at room temperature until the cinnamon rolls are baked., Once the cinnamon rolls have bene removed from the oven, spread the cream cheese frosting on them while they are still warm., Let cool slightly and serve warm.","[('whole milk', 1.0, 'cup'), ('granulated sugar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('active dry yeast', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('large eggs', 2.0, None), ('salted butter', 6.0, 'tablespoon'), ('pure vanilla extract', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('all-purpose flour', 4.0, 'cups'), ('fine sea salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('ground cinnamon', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('brown sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('ground cinnamon', 2.5, 'tablespoons'), ('salted butter', 6.0, 'tablespoon'), ('cream cheese', 8.0, 'oz'), ('powdered sugar', 2.0, 'cups'), ('pure vanilla extract', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('fine sea salt', 0.125, 'tsp')]"

(heaping) salt, Plenty of melted butter, 2 c. sugar, Generous sprinkling of cinnamon, 1 (2-lb.) bag powdered sugar, 2 tsp. maple flavoring, 1/2 c. milk, 1/4 c. melted butter, 1/4 c. brewed coffee, 1/8 tsp. salt","For the dough: Heat the milk, vegetable oil, and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat to just below a boil. Set aside and cool to warm. Sprinkle the yeast on top and let it sit on the milk for 1 minute., Add 8 cups of the flour. Stir until just combined, then cover with a clean kitchen towel, and set aside in a relatively warm place for 1 hour. After 1 hour, remove the towel and add the baking powder, baking soda, salt, and the remaining 1 cup flour. Stir thoroughly to combine. Use the dough right away, or place in a mixing bowl and refrigerate for up to 3 days, punching down the dough if it rises to the top of the bowl. (Note: The dough is easier to work with if it has been chilled for at least an hour or so beforehand.), To assemble the rolls, remove half the dough from the bowl. On a floured baking surface, roll the dough into a large rectangle, about 30 by 10 inches. The dough should be rolled very thin., To make the filling, pour 3/4 cup to 1 cup of melted butter over the surface of the dough. Use your fingers to spread the butter evenly. Generously sprinkle half of the ground cinnamon and 1 cup of the sugar over the butter. Don’t be afraid to drizzle on more butter or more sugar! Gooey is the goal., Now, beginning at the end farthest from you, roll the rectangle tightly towards you. Use both hands and work slowly, being careful to keep the roll tight. Don't worry if the filling oozes as you work; that just means the rolls are going to be divine. When you reach the end, pinch the seam together and flip the roll so that the seam is face down. When you're finished, you'll wind up with one long buttery, cinnamon-y, sugary, gooey log., Slip a cutting board underneath the roll and with a sharp knife, make 1/2-inch slices. One log will produce 20 to 25 rolls. Pour a couple of teaspoons of melted butter into disposable foil cake pans (or regular 9-inch round cake pans) and swirl to coat. Place the sliced rolls in the pans, being careful not to overcrowd. (Each pan will hold 7 to 9 rolls.), Repeat the rolling/sugar/butter process with the other half of the dough and more pans. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Cover all the pans with a kitchen towel and set aside to rise on the countertop for at least 20 minutes before baking. Remove the towel and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, until golden brown. Don't allow the rolls to become overly brown., While the rolls are baking, make the maple icing: In a large bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, butter, coffee, and salt. Splash in the maple flavoring. Whisk until very smooth. Taste and add in more maple, sugar, butter, or other ingredients, as needed, until the icing reaches the desired consistency. The icing should be somewhat thick but still very pourable., Remove the pans from the oven. Immediately drizzle icing over the top. Be sure to get it all around the edges and over the top. As they sit, the rolls will absorb some of the icing's moisture and flavor. They only get better with time… not that they last for more than a few seconds. Make them for a friend today! It'll seal the relationship for life. I promise.","[('whole milk', 1.0, 'qt'), ('vegetable oil', 1.0, 'c'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'c'), ('active dry yeast', 2.0, 'packets'), ('all-purpose flour', 9.0, 'c'), ('baking powder', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('baking soda', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('salt', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('butter', None, None), ('sugar', 2.0, 'c'), ('cinnamon', None, None), ('powdered sugar', 1.0, 'bag'), ('maple flavoring', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('milk', 0.5, 'c'), ('butter', 0.25, 'c'), ('coffee', 0.25, 'c'), ('salt', 0.125, 'tsp')]"

The texture is incredible., Make sure the melted butter and milk mixture has cooled slightly before making the dough. If it’s too hot, the dough will become incredibly sticky like cake batter (I’ve experienced this many times). If this happens to you, don’t worry- wait for the dough to cool down before adding more flour, if needed., Recent recipe update: to prevent the cinnamon sugar filling from leaking while the rolls bake, instead of using 28g (2 tbsp) of melted butter, combine 84 g (6 tbsp) softened butter with the rest of the cinnamon-sugar filling ingredients listed above.","Baker's Schedule, Overnight Option, Make the dough in the evening and let rise overnight. The following morning, roll, cut and shape the dough. Rest for 1-2 hours (second rise) before baking., As an alternative, after resting for 1 hour, cover the dough and chill until ready to use. Rest at room temperature before baking. The dough should be plump and puffy before baking., Make-Ahead Option (Freeze): Place the cut & shaped cinnamon rolls into a parchment lined 9-inch springform pan. Cover with two layers of plastic wrap. Freeze until ready to use. The night before baking, remove the old plastic wrap and replace with fresh wrap (this prevents any condensation from dripping onto the rolls). Defrost overnight, about 10-12 hrs. at room temperature, approximately 67 F. Bake the following morning as directed., Make the Dough, In the evening: Combine the melted butter and milk in a small bowl. Cool slightly before using., Add the egg, sourdough starter, and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix to combine. With the machine running, slowly pour in the milk mixture. Add the flour and salt. Continue mixing until a rough, sticky dough forms, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes., After the dough has rested, switch to the dough hook. Knead on medium-low speed for 6-8 minutes (I use #2 or #3 on my stand mixer). The dough should feel soft, supple and pull away from the sides of the bowl when ready. If it’s too sticky add a small bit of flour., Bulk Rise, Transfer the dough to a medium-size bowl coated in butter. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise overnight until double in size, about 8-12 + hrs. @ 67-68 F, depending on temperature., Stretch and Fold the Dough (optional step): about 30 minutes- 1 hr. into the bulk rise stretch and fold the dough: grab a portion of the dough and stretch it upward. Fold it over toward the center of the bowl. Give the bowl a 1/4 turn; stretch and fold the dough again. Continue this technique until you’ve come full circle around the bowl (4 folds total). For video guidance, click here. This optional step will increase the overall volume of the rolls and aerate the dough., Roll the Dough, In the morning: Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper. I like to scrunch the paper into a ball first, open it up, and then line the inside with enough excess to hang over the sides for easy removal. It tends to fit better this way., Lightly oil and flour your countertop to prevent sticking. Coax the dough out of the bowl. Gently pat into a rough rectangle. Let rest for 10 minutes for easier rolling., Dust the dough (and your rolling pin) with flour. Roll the dough into a 16 x 12-ish rectangle using a tape measure for accuracy. If the dough resists, let rest for 5-10 minutes and try again., Make the Cinnamon-Sugar Filling, If using the softened butter variation (listed in the notes above): add 84 g (6 tbsp) softened butter to a small bowl. Mix with the sugar, cinnamon and flour. With an offset spatula, spread onto the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges., If using the melted butter version: brush the entire surface of the dough, including the top, bottom and sides with 28 g (2 tbsp) melted butter. Use all of it. Combine the sugar, cinnamon and flour in a bowl. Sprinkle the mixture onto the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Smooth it out with your hands until it looks wet and sandy., Shape & Cut the Dough, Starting on the long side of the dough (16-inch), roll it into a log pressing down gently as you go. Take your time with this step. The log needs to be tight so the swirls stay in tact. You should end up seam side down. TIP: if the dough starts to get sticky from the heat of your hands, lightly oil or flour your fingertips, take a deep breath and try again., Cut the dough into 2-inch sections using a oiled knife or bench scraper. I lightly “mark” the dough first to make sure each piece is roughly the same size., Second Rise, Place the rolls into the lined pan and let rest for 1- 2 hours, or until the dough puffs up. Alternatively, if you’d like to chill or freeze the rolls, please refer to the “Make-Ahead” option in the Baker’s Schedule at the top of this recipe., Bake the Cinnamon Rolls, Preheat oven to 350 F. Bake the dough onto the center rack and bake for 35-40 minutes (check at the 30 minute mark). The tops should turn light golden brown when ready., Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 15 minutes. This helps the butter to absorb back into the dough. Then lift up the rolls, while still on the parchment paper, and transfer to a wire rack., Make the Glaze, While the rolls are baking or cooling make the glaze. Add softened butter, whipped cream cheese and sifted powdered sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat until smooth, thinning out the consistency with a little milk as needed. The ingredients must be soft and at room temperature for best results., To serve, top the rolls with some of the glaze or lightly dust with powdered sugar. These rolls are best enjoyed slightly warm on the same day they are baked.","[('milk', 160.0, 'g'), ('butter', 28.0, 'g'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('sourdough starter', 100.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 24.0, 'g'), ('flour', 300.0, 'g'), ('salt', 5.0, 'g'), ('butter', 28.0, 'g'), ('butter', 28.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 100.0, 'g'), ('cinnamon', 3.0, 'tsp'), ('flour', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('butter', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('cream cheese', 1.0, 'cup'), ('powdered sugar', 0.25, 'cup'), ('milk', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('butter', 115.0, 'g'), ('flour', 360.0, 'g'), ('butter', 84.0, 'g')]"

Knead the levain until it forms a cohesive ball. Set in a liquid measuring cup and cover for 12 hours until the levain has doubled in size and the top is rounded., Sourdough Cinnamon Rolls, Warm the milk in the microwave (about 1 1/2 minutes full power) or on the stove. It should be around 90-100 degrees F, no warmer than that. To the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook, add the ripe levain, warmed milk and melted butter., Add the sugar, eggs, salt and most of the bread flour. Turn on the dough hook and knead for a few minutes. Add the remainder of the bread flour as needed. The dough should be tacky, not overly sticky and should all cling to one side of the bowl (or away from the edges depending on your mixer). Knead for a total of 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth., Bulk Fermentation: Put the dough in a container and cover. Set the dough in a warm, 78-80 degree F place for 4 hours. Take the temperature of the dough as needed to make sure the dough temperature stays right around 78 degrees F. This temperature is the optimal fermentation., At the end of about 4 hours, the dough should be puffed up and feel very elastic. If it doesn't feel this way, let it bulk ferment for another half hour and check again., Overnight Refrigeration: At this point, after the bulk fermentation has finished, cover the dough and put it in the refrigerator. Proceed with the recipe the next day, shaping and proofing the rolls before baking. This allows you to time the cinnamon rolls for breakfast or brunch if desired. If you prefer to shape the rolls and bake them the same day, skip the overnight refrigeration and proceed with the recipe., Mix up the Filling: Near the end of bulk fermentation, mix up the cinnamon roll filling. To a small bowl, add the melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and flour. Mix together. Set aside., Shaping: Line a half sheet pan (18 by 13 inches) with parchment paper. Roll the dough out into an approximate 18 by 12 rectangle. Spread the cinnamon filling all over the dough with your fingers, making sure to cover up to the edges of the cinnamon roll. Starting with the dough closest to you, roll up the cinnamon roll and pinch together the seam. Flip the cinnamon roll over, seam side down. Cut the long log of cinnamon roll dough into 12 equal pieces. Place the cinnamon rolls on the parchment paper, snuggling all 12 rolls together on the pan., Proofing: Cover the pan and let rise in a 78 degree F place until puffed up and risen, about 3 hours. Do not bake these rolls if they have not risen., Baking: Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake for about 22-25 minutes until baked all the way through., Cream Cheese Frosting: Using a hand mixer, whip together softened butter and cream cheese. Add the powdered sugar, heavy whipping cream, vanilla extract, maple extract and salt. Whip together for 2-3 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. The frosting should be light and fluffy., Spread frosting over the tops of the cinnamon rolls while they are still warm.

Spread the softened butter evenly across the top. Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon (and cardamom, if using) in a bowl and sprinkle evenly across the top of the butter. Pat down very lightly., Starting with one long end, start rolling the rectangle into a log without pulling and stretching on the dough (but still rolling as tightly as possible). Roll the seam to the bottom and pat the log into an even thickness - it should be about 20 inches long or so at this point., Cut the log into 12 even pieces. Place the rolls on a parchment-lined half sheet pan, tucking the loose end of the roll underneath, if you want. The rolls should be about an inch apart so they have room to rise. Cover with lightly greased plastic wrap and let rise until noticeably puffy and almost doubled, about an hour., Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-25 minutes until lightly golden and baked through. Let cool until warm before frosting., For the frosting, add the cream cheese and butter to a medium bowl. Whip with a handheld (or stand) mixer until creamy. Add the salt, milk or cream, and vanilla.

Dump about half of the dry ingredients into the yeast mixture and stir until combined. Pour in the remaining dry ingredients and knead in the bowl using the dough hook attachment until smooth and slightly tacky, about 7 minutes. If you notice your dough isn’t pulling away from the sides of the bowl or it’s too wet, add flour 2 tablespoons at a time until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms a little dough “tornado” around the dough hook. Once done kneading, place the dough into a large lightly greased bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap to double in size, about 1-1/2 – 2 hours., Once the dough has risen, dump it out onto a lightly floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll it out into a large rectangle about 11”x21” in size. Pour the melted butter and spread it out over top. Combine the cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and brown sugar and sprinkle evenly over the buttered dough. Starting with one of the long ends, tightly roll the dough from end to end and pinch the edges together to seal.

Set aside for about 6 to 7 minutes so the yeast can activate (it’ll look foamy when ready)., For the dough: Flour a working surface for later. Add 2 cups of flour into a large mixing bowl., Melt 1/3 cup butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Remove the pot from the burner and stir in the almond milk, 1/3 cup sugar, and salt.

In a small bowl, mix 1/2 cup sugar and the cinnamon and set aside., Make the pan sauce: In a small pot, melt 1/2 cup butter (you can use the unwashed pot from before). Remove half of the melted butter (eyeballing it is fine) and put it in another small bowl (this will be spread onto the rolled-out dough before adding the cinnamon sugar).

Sprinkle on all of the cinnamon sugar filling, leaving a 1/2 inch around the edges without any sugar., Grab the end of the dough (short side of rectangle) and roll it up, rolling as tightly as possible. Place it seam-side down once it’s rolled up. Use a serrated knife to slice 1 1/2 inch–thick rolls.

I like to reheat unfrosted rolls in the oven on a baking sheet for 5 minutes at 350°F (180°C). The oven returns them to their amazing gooey-soft state! Alternatively, you can freeze the cooled unfrosted rolls (wrap them in a layer of plastic wrap, followed by tinfoil) for a week or two.

Spread dough evenly with half of the softened butter, about 1/4 cup. Sprinkle dough with half of the brown sugar, raisins, and cinnamon. You can omit the raisins, but my family loves them., Roll up dough into one long roll. Cut rolls, using a piece of dental floss or thread, about two inches thick. Place rolls in greased 9X13-inch baking pans, leaving about 2-inches between the rolls so they have room to rise. Now follow the exact same steps with the other half of the dough., Cover the pans with a clean kitchen towel. Let the rolls rise until double in bulk. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake for 20-30 minutes or until cinnamon rolls are golden brown on top and cooked in the middle. Every oven is different so check at 20 minutes to be safe, but it might take longer. You don't want them to be doughy in the middle. Time will also vary based on how big they get during the second rise. Ours take closer to 28-30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let the rolls cool to room temperature., While the rolls are cooling, make the frosting. In a medium bowl, whisk together butter, sugar, milk, and vanilla.

You can also make the dough by hand, but the mixer makes it much easier and results in a smoother dough., Make the psyllium gel: In a bowl, mix together the psyllium husk and warm water. After about 30-45 seconds, a gel will form., In the bowl of the stand mixer, whisk together the tapioca starch, millet flour, sorghum flour, sugar, instant yeast, baking powder, xanthan gum and salt.Tip: If using active dry yeast instead, you need to activate it first. Mix together the active dry yeast, 1-2 tbsp of the sugar and the warm milk. Set aside for 10-15 minutes, or until the mixture starts frothing. Then, add it to the dry ingredients along with the psyllium gel, egg and melted butter., Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and add the psyllium gel, warm milk, egg and melted butter., Knead the dough until smooth and all the ingredients are evenly incorporated, then knead for a further 5 minutes (if using a stand mixer) or 8-10 minutes (if kneading it by hand). Use a rubber spatula to occasionally scrape along the sides and bottom of the bowl to prevent any dry patches of unmixed flour.Tip: This extra kneading time will make the dough EXTRA smooth, which is the key to beautiful gluten free cinnamon rolls., The final dough will be slightly sticky to the touch – that’s okay, you’ll be working on a lightly floured surface so it shouldn’t be a problem. Resist the temptation to add more flour to the dough, as that can make the final rolls too dense and dry.Tip: If you find the dough too sticky to easily handle (even on a floured surface and with floured hands), you can chill it in the fridge for about 1 hour before proceeding to the next step. This will give the flours in the dough time to properly hydrate and also firm up the butter in the dough – both of these factors will make the dough firmer, less sticky, and therefore easier to handle., Cinnamon filling:, In a bowl, mix together the very soft butter, light brown sugar and ground cinnamon until you get a soft, spreadable paste.Tip: If it's too thick to spread easily, you can soften it slightly in the microwave (in 2-3 second bursts, mix in between). If it's too runny, you can chill it briefly in the fridge until it thickens to the right consistency., Set aside until needed., Assembling the cinnamon rolls:, Lightly butter a 10-inch (25cm) skillet or round baking pan, and set aside until needed., Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a ball., Roll it out into a roughly 11×15-inch (28x38cm) rectangle., Dollop on the cinnamon filling and spread it out into an even layer across the rolled-out dough, all the way to the edges., Cut the rectangle lengthways into seven 1½-inch (4cm) wide strips, so that they’re 15 inches (38cm) long. I like to use a pizza cutter for this, but a sharp knife will also work well., Roll up each individual strip into a roll – this will give you the perfect swirl., Arrange the cinnamon rolls in the buttered skillet or baking pan, they should only just touch each other., Proofing the cinnamon rolls:, Proof the cinnamon rolls in a warm place for about 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes or until about doubled in volume. Lightly cover them with a sheet of plastic wrap/cling film to prevent them from drying out during proofing.Tip: If your kitchen is on the cold side, you can proof them in a lukewarm oven (the ideal proofing temperature is around 79ºF/26ºC). I usually place a cup of hot water inside the oven, to maintain a fairly humid environment., Baking the cinnamon rolls:, While the rolls are proofing, adjust the oven rack to the middle position and pre-heat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC)., Once the cinnamon rolls have doubled in volume, pour warm heavy/double cream evenly all over them.Tip: The addition of cream makes these gluten free cinnamon rolls extra rich and soft. It’s important that you use warm cream (not cold from the fridge)., Cover the skillet or baking pan with a sheet of aluminium foil. Tip: You don’t need to cover it super tightly, just enough so that most of the steam generated during baking will get trapped by the foil. But arrange it so that it’s fairly easy to remove later on, without having to necessarily remove the skillet or pan from the oven, if at all possible., Bake the cinnamon rolls at 350ºF (180ºC) covered with the aluminium foil for 20 minutes.Tip: The aluminium foil traps the steam generated during baking, which prevents a crust from forming on top of the cinnamon rolls. This allows them to expand much more during this first part of baking, so they’ll end up even softer and squishier., After the 20 minutes, remove the aluminium foil and continue baking until the cinnamon rolls get golden on top – about 15 minutes more., Allow the baked cinnamon rolls to cool for 5-10 minutes while you prepare the cream cheese icing., Cream cheese icing:, In a bowl, whisk together the cream cheese and butter until smooth. (You can do this by hand with a balloon whisk, with a hand mixer fitted with the double beaters, or with a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.), Add the powdered sugar, vanilla and salt, and whisk well until evenly combined, smooth and creamy., Spread the cream cheese icing over the cinnamon rolls while they're still hot or very warm. You can use all of the icing, or spread just ¾ of it over the rolls and set the rest aside for anyone who wants extra with their cinnamon roll.Tip: The warmth/heat from the cinnamon rolls will cause the icing to partially melt into all the nooks and crannies, and it will make the cinnamon rolls even more decadent and luxurious., Enjoy the cinnamon rolls while they're still warm., Serving and storage:, These gluten free cinnamon rolls are best served while they’re warm., They're at their best on the day of baking, but you can keep them in a closed container for about 2-3 days. Just before serving, re-heat them briefly in the microwave for 15-20 seconds. This will return them to their original pillowy softness., Overnight, make-ahead options:, Option 1: You can prepare the dough and then keep it in the fridge overnight (in a closed container or in a covered bowl). You can then roll, shape, proof and bake the cinnamon rolls the next day., Option 2: You can make the dough and shape the cinnamon rolls, and then keep the tightly covered skillet or baking pan in the fridge overnight. The next day, bring the rolls to room temperature. If they haven’t doubled in size by the time they’ve reached room temperature, proof them for a while longer – and then, pour over the heavy/double cream and bake according to the recipe.","[('psyllium husk', 15.0, 'g'), ('water', 180.0, 'g'), ('tapioca starch', 160.0, 'g'), ('millet flour', 135.0, 'g'), ('sorghum flour', 25.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 50.0, 'g'), ('yeast', 6.0, 'g'), ('baking powder', 6.0, 'g'), ('xanthan gum', 5.0, 'g'), ('salt', 5.0, 'g'), ('milk', 100.0, 'g'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('butter', 35.0, 'g'), ('butter', 85.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 100.0, 'g'), ('cinnamon', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('butter', 0.5, 'tbsp'), ('cream', 100.0, 'g'), ('cream cheese', 115.0, 'g'), ('butter', 55.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 90.0, 'g'), ('vanilla', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('salt', 1.0, None)]"

Using a rubber spatula, stir it all together until you have a shaggy, bump-y, sticky dough. Cover it tightly with Bee’s Wrap or plastic wrap and set the bowl in a warm spot for up to 18 hours. I place mine on the fireplace mantel or on top of the fridge., THE NEXT DAY, make the filling and form the cinnamon rolls. In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and vanilla powder, if using. Line a 9x13 inch baking dish with parchment paper and set aside., Sprinkle a good amount of flour on your work surface and flour a rolling pin as well. This dough is sticky, so keep some flour on hand. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the dough out onto your floured surface.

Remove the whisk and attach the dough hook. Add the rest of the flour and begin kneading the dough., At this point allow the dough to knead for at least 10 minutes, preferably 15. This will allow the gluten to develop and give you a smooth dough to work with. It will also create the perfect texture. Once the dough finishes kneading, place it into a greased bowl, and wrap it. Refrigerate it for at least 2 hours, or up to 2 days., Prepare the filling by mixing the brown sugar, cinnamon, and cornstarch. Set aside. Make sure your butter is soft.

The dough will be thick, shaggy dough that’s still quite a bit sticky and that’s ok!, Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and then use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until it becomes elastic and can easily form into a smooth ball. The dough should feel slightly tacky but it should not stick to your hands or the kneading surface. If the dough is still too sticky, add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time and continue to knead the dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball., Grease a clean, large bowl with one teaspoon of avocado oil and then transfer the ball of dough to the greased bowl.

Spread half of the butter evenly over one rectangle of the dough. Sprinkle half of the sugar mixture evenly across the butter. Roll the dough up tightly lengthwise, then turn it so that the seam side is down. Cut the roll into 12 equal slices, a serrated knife works best. You can bake these, cut-side up, on a parchment lined baking sheet, in cupcake liners, or in a buttered baking dish. I used a well-buttered standard pie dish. Unless you are using individual cupcake liners, you want to arrange the slices about 1/2-inch from each other on the baking sheet or in the baking dish.

Mix in the active dry yeast and allow to stand and activate, about 8 minutes, until foamy and alive!, To a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar and salt. To the bowl with the yeast mixture, add the beaten eggs and vanilla extract; then all at once, add the flour mixture. Attach the dough hook to your mixer and mix on low until the dough starts to become cohesive. With the mixer running on low, slowly add the cubes of butter., Knead on medium speed for about 5 minutes. Alternatively, if you’re doing this by hand, you’ll need to knead the dough for about 10 to 15 minutes. The dough will go from crumbly and separate to completely cohesive and smooth. The dough shouldn’t be sticky. Remove the dough from the hook and the bowl and form it into a ball., Transfer the ball of dough to a clean, lightly greased bowl (I used the flour bowl and just wiped it clean with a kitchen towel and then greased it). Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and transfer to the fridge to rise for at least 2 hours or overnight., To Make the Filling:, To the bowl of a stand-up mixer (with the paddle attachment) or using a medium bowl and a fork, add the butter, cinnamon, brown sugar, white sugar, vanilla and salt. Mix and mash until the filling is completely smooth., *If you’re looking to save yourself a step in the morning, you can make this filling let it sit on the counter overnight so it stays softened., To Assemble the Cinnamon Rolls:, The following morning (or after the 2-hour mark), remove the dough from the fridge. Lightly flour your work surface and place the dough into the center. Lightly flour your rolling pin and roll the dough into a 1/8-inch thick rectangle that measures 15“ x 22“ If it’s not a perfect rectangle, then that’s totally ok., Add the filling to the dough and spread into a thin layer, using a butter knife or offset spatula. I smeared the filling pretty close to the edges. Starting from the edge furthest from you, roll the dough towards you, horizontally, into a firm log., Slice the dough into two and transfer and carefully transfer them to a cutting board. Place them in the freezer to chill for 10 minutes. I find that slicing cold dough is WAY easier., Remove from the freezer and slice the rolls into 1 1/2-inch rolls, about 12-16 rolls, trimming the ends off., Transfer to a greased 9 x 13 baking sheet (or something comparable). Cover with a kitchen towel and allow to rise for an additional 45 minutes, or until doubled in size. *If you're house is particularly cold, it may take longer for the rolls to rise. I like to place my cinnamon rolls by the oven because it's usually warmer in that part of my house., Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes., To Make the Cream Cheese Icing:, To the bowl of a stand-up mixer (or a large bowl) with the paddle attachment, mix together the butter and cream cheese until smooth. Add the sugars, vanilla paste, salt and heavy cream. Beat for about 20 seconds., To Serve:, When the cinnamon rolls come out of the oven, pour the icing over the cinnamon rolls and smother them with icing. *See below for instructions on assembling the rolls and then allowing them to rise overnight in the fridge.","[('milk', 0.25, 'cup'), ('yeast', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('flour', 2.75, 'cup'), ('sugar', 3.0, 'tablespoons'), ('salt', 1.25, 'teaspoon'), ('eggs', 3.0, None), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('butter', 0.5, 'cup'), ('butter', 0.5, 'cup'), ('cinnamon', 0.25, 'cup'), ('brown sugar', 3.0, 'tablespoons'), ('sugar', 3.0, 'tablespoons'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', None, 'pinch'), ('butter', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('cream cheese', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('powdered sugar', 2.0, 'cups'), ('vanilla extract', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', None, 'pinch'), ('heavy cream', 1.0, 'tablespoon')]"

Continue mixing until the mixture achieves a smooth consistency., Gradually incorporate the flour into the mixture, ensuring thorough mixing until the wet and dry ingredients are fully combined., If your dough is sticky, use your hands to bring it together. Don't worry if it's a bit flaky or has some crumbly parts. Flour a dry surface and start kneading by hand for 7-8 minutes. Alternatively, you can use a stand mixer with a hook attachment for this step., Once your dough is smooth, transfer it to a large, buttered bowl.

If it’s too cold, turn on your oven until it’s warm (not hot) inside and let it puff up there., Assembly, Dust flour on a clean tabletop and roll the dough. Every couple of rolls make sure it’s not sticking and dust more flour underneath and on top. Roll it out to 2mm thick so that you get lots of rolls instead of just a couple thick ones.

If it's a little short or uneven, feel free to cut off the edges to even it all out., Spread softened butter over dough, being sure to go right to the edges leaving a 1-inch strip untouched on one of the longer sides of dough. Dump brown sugar mixture onto the middle of the dough and spread with your hands, creating an even layer over top of the butter, still leaving that 1-inch strip of dough untouched. If you have any filling that falls off the sides of the dough, use a bench scraper to replace. Lightly press the sugar mixture into the butter using a rolling pin., Roll the dough up into a tight log, finishing with the plain dough on the bottom to seal the entire thing together.

Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/silicone spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula is a better choice.*, On medium speed, beat in the remaining sugar (which should be 1/2 cup/100g) and the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Add the eggs and salt and beat on medium speed until combined. The butter won’t really be mixing into the mixture, so don’t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. Switch the mixer down to low speed and with it running, add 1 cup of flour at a time, making sure it’s fully incorporated before adding the next. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. After 4 cups have been added, add the last 1/2 cup and beat until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 3 minutes. Dough will be soft., Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if you used the paddle) and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st Rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), Grease the bottom and sides of a metal or glass 9×13-inch baking dish (glass or metal) or line with parchment paper., Roll out the dough, Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 12×18-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll it out, stop what you’re doing, cover it lightly, and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When you return to the dough, it should stretch out much easier., For the filling, Spread the softened butter all over the dough. The softer the butter is, the easier it is to spread in this step. (Microwave it for a few seconds to soften if needed.) In a small bowl, mix the sugar and cinnamon together. Sprinkle evenly over the butter. Tightly roll up the dough to form an 18-inch-long log. If some filling spills out, sprinkle it on top of the roll. With an extra sharp knife, cut into 12 even rolls, about 1.5 inches each. Arrange in the prepared baking pan., 2nd Rise, Cover the rolls tightly and allow to rise until puffy, about 1 hour. (Or use the overnight option in the Notes below.), Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C)., Bake for about 25–28 minutes or until they are lightly browned on top. After about 15 minutes, tent a piece of aluminum foil over the top of the pan to prevent the tops from browning too quickly. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack for about 10 minutes as you make the icing., Make the icing, In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until smooth and creamy. Add the confectioners’ sugar, cream/milk, and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 1 minute.

Cook it over medium heat, stirring continuously until the mixture thickens like a pudding, 3 to 5 minutes. Note: The flour paste is ready once the whisk leaves drag lines on the base of the pan, or when an instant-read thermometer reaches 65°C (149°F). Do not overcook., Scoop the flour paste into a mixing bowl. Let it cool for a bit, 15 minutes at room temperature or quicker in the chiller, as long as it’s not hot., Make the main dough, Whisk the eggs and remaining milk into the cooled roux until the mixture is free of lumps. (Note: If using active dry yeast in place of instant yeast, only whisk the eggs into the cooled flour paste, and use the milk to activate the active dry yeast in the next step)., In a stand mixer, combine 455 g / 16 oz of bread flour (save the balance and only add as much as you need to if needed later), instant yeast, sugar, and salt. Give it a good stir to mix well. Note: If using active dry yeast, sprinkle over the remaining milk that’s slightly warmed to 40°C /110°F (anything hotter than 46°C/115°F will kill the yeast). Allow the yeast to activate - it will look frothy and smell yeasty - a good sign! This may take about 5 to 7 minutes, depending on the temperature of the milk. Add this with the roux mixture and melted butter in the next step., Add the flour paste mixture and melted butter. Paddle the mixture on low speed until barely combined. Then let the mixture sit for 5 minutes to allow the flour to absorb the liquids., Scrape the dough off the paddle and switch it out for a dough hook. Start the mixer at medium speed and knead until the dough becomes smooth and elastic and starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl, about 5 -7 minutes. Important tip: The dough should feel tackyNote 4 and leave the sides of the bowl mostly clean with bits still sticking to the sides, but the dough will stick to the bottom - this is OK! Do not be tempted to add more flour at this point. If you touch the dough and bits of it stick to your fingers, this is the time to add a bit more flour, 1 - 2 tbsps at a time, and knead it in for a minute to allow the dough to absorb it, and check again. Stop when it feels sticky but you can pull away your fingers cleanly., Test for 'windowpane': Lightly grease your fingers and palms with some oil, take a small ball of dough and gently stretch it. The dough is ready for proofing when it can be stretched to a thin, translucent layer (‘windowpane’) without breaking. Otherwise, knead for a few more minutes and test again., First rise: Gather the dough into a ball and place it in a large greased mixing bowl. Cover with a clean tea towel and place in a warm area. Let it rise for 25 - 30 minutes or until doubled in volume., Make the cinnamon roll filling, While the dough is proofing, stir together brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and ground nutmeg in a large mixing bowl until well mixed. Mix in the softened butter with a spatula until well combined.Alternative method: Mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg, but leave out the butter., Make the rolls, Roll out the dough: Once doubled in volume, overturn the bowl to tip out the dough. Lightly flour the countertop (or a pastry mat) and rolling pin. Roll the dough into a rectangle measuring 24"" x 15"" (60 x 38 cm). Note: The dough will be thin when rolled flat to the suggested size - this is OK. You also don't need to be exact here - so long as you get a good rectangular size to work with., Spread the filling: With a rubber spatula, spread the cinnamon roll filling over the rectangular dough, leaving 0.5""/1-cm on one of the long edges clean. Brush this clean edge with some water to help seal the end when you complete the roll.Alternative method: Spread the softened butter all over the dough with a rubber spatula, leaving 0.5""/1-cm on one of the long edges clean. Then sprinkle the cinnamon mixture, covering the butter evenly. Brush the clean edge with water., Shape into rolls: Starting on the long edge, roll up the dough tightly, Swiss-roll style. Cut a bit off both ends of the roll. Then cut into 12 rolls. Tip: Use a sharp, non-serrated knife or dental floss. To get 12 equal rolls, cut the long roll into two halves. Again, halve each of the 2 rolls so you now have 4. Then cut each of the 4 rolls into 3 equal rolls, so you end up with 12., Second rise: Place the rolls in a greased 9"" x 13"" x 2"" (23 x 33 x 5 cm) baking pan, spacing them a bit apart. Cover with a tea towel and proof in a warm place for 20 - 25 minutes., Bake the rolls, While the rolls sit, preheat the oven to 190°C (374°F) Optional: Just before putting the rolls into the oven, warm the heavy cream in a saucepan over low heat. Heat only until the chill is off - not to the point of simmering/boiling. Pour over the top and all around the rolls. Allow the cream to soak in for 1 minute., Bake on the middle rack for 20 - 22 minutes or until the rolls have turned golden brown and the center ones are cooked through. Once out of the oven, let the rolls cool completely in the pan. Note: Baking times will vary, depending on the size of the rolls, the type and size of baking pan used, how the rolls are packed in, the type of oven, etc. Check at the 20-minute mark and if the rolls are not all baked through, extend the baking time by 3 - 4 minutes., Make the cream cheese frosting, In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle or using handheld beaters, beat softened cream cheese and butter at medium speed until smooth, about 30 seconds., Beat in the salt (omit if using salted butter), vanilla extract or lemon juice, and icing sugar. until smooth, about 1 minute. Set aside.Note 3, Frost the cinnamon rolls, Spread the cream cheese frosting over the cooled rolls (I personally like the frosting a bit melty and spread them over slightly warm, not hot, rolls so it melts into the gaps in between the folds. For a thicker finish, set aside some frosting to spread over the rolls once more when they've completely cooled.), Store the rolls, Store leftover rolls in an air-tight container or wrap individual slices tightly in cling wrap.

If you do not have a thermometer, the milk should be warm to the touch but not hot. Whisk the yeast and 1 tsp sugar into the milk to dissolve. Over the next few minutes, the milk/yeast mixture should become foamy as the yeast begins to grow. If it doesn't, this likely means that your yeast has expired or the milk was too hot, causing it to die. Get some fresh yeast and try again, otherwise your babka won't rise... and that would be a major bummer., While the yeast proofs, cream together the butter and sugar in a stand mixer fit with the paddle attachment., Once the butter and sugar are well combined, add the oil and vanilla extract and mix well at low speed. Add egg yolks 1 at a time and increase the mixer to high. Beat for an additional 2 minutes., Turn the mixer back to low speed and add 2 1/2 cups flour and 1 tsp salt, then add the foamy yeast mixture. Be sure to give the yeast mixture a final whisk before adding it in, especially if it is very foamy., Mix until just combined, then replace the paddle attachment with the dough hook. Continue to mix, adding 1 tbsp of flour at a time, just until a soft dough forms. The amount of flour you need will vary based on humidity levels; best to add flour slowly and check texture as you go.You want a dough that is soft a pliable, not stiff. The dough should be tacky, but not wet or sticky, and shouldn't cling to the skin. Do not walk away during this part, you also want to keep an eye on the dough to make sure that you do not over mix it. It should be easy to form into a smooth ball., Once a soft dough forms that can easily be removed from the hook by hand, transfer it to a lightly floured surface and knead several times, or until you have a smooth ball of dough. Do not over-knead., Place the ball of dough into a greased mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. I prefer to let the dough rise in the refrigerator overnight, but if you prefer you can let it rise at room temperature for 1-2 hours, or until it has just about doubled in size., To prepare the cinnamon filling: Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl until smooth. Set aside., Remove the dough from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature, about 1 hour. Once the dough reaches room temperature, roll it on a lightly floured surface until you have a 14x18 inch rectangle., Evenly spread the cinnamon filling over the dough, leaving an even 1 inch border around the edge., Starting with the long side, roll the dough into a tight log., Roll the log back and forth several times, gently spreading it out until the length of the log is about 20 inches., Twist the dough into a figure 8 and pinch the ends together. Sometimes using a bit of water will help the ends to stick., Line your loaf pan with parchment paper, then lightly spray the parchment with nonstick cooking oil spray. Transfer the dough to the lined loaf pan. Cover the pan with a tea towel, or loosely with plastic wrap, and allow to rise for 1 hour, or until the babka completely fills the pan. It will get pretty big!, While the dough is rising, prepare the streusel by combining the ingredients in a mixing bowl until well combined and crumbly., Once the dough has risen, preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Using a very thin skewer, poke a few holes into the babka. This allows steam to be released during baking so that you aren't left with very large gaps between the dough and the filling., Brush the babka with an egg wash made from 1 egg white and 1 tbsp of whole milk., Sprinkle the streusel over the top of the babka. It will collect more in the crevices, but this is fine. Babka should have a rustic look., Place the pan on a baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes, then turn the pan 180 degrees and cook for an additional 25 to 30 minutes, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 185 degrees F in the thickest center part of the babka. The babka will be golden brown and should have a hollow sound when tapped., Allow the babka to cool before slicing. This is truly the hardest part of the whole process, but trust me - cutting into it while it’s still hot will leave you with quite a mess. The filling needs time to set up a bit. Even after cooling it will crumble a bit when you slice it. That's part of the charm.

Place the milk in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil. The moment it reaches a boil, remove from heat. (This process is called scalding, and it ensures the milk doesn't affect the yeast's ability to rise. Don't skip!), Pour the hot milk into the bowl of an electric mixer and add 1/2 cup butter, to bring the temperature down. Stir and allow the butter to melt completely. Then stir in the sugar. Touch the milk mixture to test the temperature. It should be close to luke warm. If it is not, add 1/2 cup flour and test again. Once it is just above room temperature, stir in the yeast and let it foam for approximately 10 minutes. (Too-hot liquid can kill yeast.), Place the bread hook on the mixer and turn on low. Add the eggs, salt, and remaining flour up to 4 cups. Allow the mixer to ""knead"" the dough until it pulls away from the sides. Run the mixer for approximately 10 minutes to allow the dough to stretch and develop the gluten. If the dough seems too sticky after the first 2-3 minutes add an additional 1/4 cup flour. After 10 minutes, turn the mixer off. Cover the top with plastic, and allow the dough to rise until double in size, approximately 60-90 minutes in a warm kitchen., For the Cinnamon Roll Filling:, Mix the brown sugar, softened butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg until smooth. Keep at room temperature until ready to use., Dump the inflated dough out on a well-floured work surface. Fold into thirds and press flat. Then turn and fold into thirds again and press into a rectangle. Roll the rectangle out into a large 16 X 20 inch sheet., Using a large flat spreader, spread the cinnamon filling over the sheet into a thin layer. Leave 1 1/2 inches bare (cinnamon-free) on one long edge. Be careful not to gouge holes in the dough. Starting at the cinnamon-covered long edge, roll the dough sheet tightly toward the uncovered edge to form a long tight log. Place a piece of parchment paper in a 9 X 13 inch baking dish. Then cut the log into 12 equal rolls. Tuck the loose end under each roll to secure it, and place them in the baking dish to rise., Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Allow the rolls to rise for at least 30 minutes while the oven heats. Then bake for 20-25 minutes, until the edges are barely golden and the center of each roll is puffed high up., For the Cream Cheese Frosting:, While the rolls are in the oven, beat the cream cheese, butter, vanilla, and powdered sugar together until completely smooth. The moment the rolls come out of the oven gently spread half the glaze over the tops and allow it to seep down into the cracks. Five minutes later, add more glaze if desired.

You can also use quick rise yeast. See different instructions after. The water needs to be at a temperature of around 100°F for the yeast to activate so it’s best to use a thermometer. Allow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes. It should double in size and be foamy at the top., Meanwhile, melt your coconut oil over low heat. Ensure the coconut oil is also not heated above 100°F., Combine flour with sea salt in a large mixing bowl. Create a well in the middle of the flour and pour the yeast mixture and coconut oil into it., If you're using quick rise yeast, add the yeast and sugar in with the flour and sea salt and stir to combine. In this instance, you will need water between 120°F and 130°F. Create a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and add 1 tablespoon of oil and the water., In both instances, once everything is in the bowl, fold the dough gently to combine it with a spatula until it comes together to form a ball that is slightly sticky. Lightly flour your surface and hands and place the dough on the surface. Press with your fingers and fold onto itself, kneading 10 to 15 times until the dough is slightly sticky. If it starts sticking to your hands, lightly flour them and your surface as you knead., If you've used a different flour and your dough is too sticky, you might need to add up to 1 cup of extra flour. However, only add a small amount at a time as you don't want to add too much flour or it will make the dough tough., Lightly oil the mixing bowl with 1 teaspoon of oil or melted butter or coconut oil. It's fine if there are remnants in the bowl from mixing. Lightly flour the outside of the ball of dough and place it in the bowl. If you used active yeast, you will need to proof it for 1 to 2 hours in a warm, dark place. Cover it with a damp towel and place somewhere like the top of the fridge or in the oven or microwave, away from any cool drafts.

Stir until all of the yeast is hydrated. Allow to bloom for 6-8 minutes, or until the yeast has expanded. If the yeast does not expand, try again with new yeast., Add flour, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and brown sugar to a large bowl. Do not combine. Allow the flour to remain at the bottom of the bowl., Place the brown sugar in a small bowl and set aside., Place the eggs and vanilla in a small bowl and set aside. You don’t want shells in your beautiful brioche!, Add the 200 grams of dark brown sugar and 2 tbsp of cinnamon (for the filling) to a small bowl and set far aside. You won’t need this until after the dough is complete., Cut the butter into 1 tbsp cubes and set aside. You won’t need them until the rest of the dough has come together, but you want them to be a soft room temperature before they’re added to the dough., Add the bloomed yeast mixture, vanilla extract, pumpkin puree, eggs, and three level 1-cup scoops of your dry ingredients to the mixing bowl of a stand mixer. Stir the ingredients with the flat beater of your stand mixer until combined, and the ingredients are starting to stick together., Switch to the dough hook of your stand mixer, and begin kneading with the dough hook. Use a 1/4 cup measurement to scoop level amounts of your dry ingredients into your dough. Knead for at least one minute on low speed between additions., When the dough comes away from the sides of the mixing bowl, add flour, 1 tbsp at a time, still kneading for at least a minute between additions., If you use all of the flour in the recipe, you should not need more than 3-4 more tablespoons of flour total. At this point, the dough is “finished” when it is ever-so-slightly tacky to the touch, but not sticky. It should also pass the windowpane test at this point, before you incorporate the butter., Once the dough passes the windowpane test (the first time), begin adding the butter, one tablespoon at a time. This is the longest part of the dough-making process, so pack your patience! Allow the dough to fully incorporate each tablespoon of butter before adding the next one. The bowl will likely get a buttery coating during this process. That is normal!, When all of the butter is incorporated, allow the dough to knead for another 5-7 minutes on low speed. The dough is complete when it easily passes the windowpane test (again!) and is very pliable., Spray the mixing bowl with a light coating of cooking spray, and allow the dough to rise, covered with plastic wrap (with a small hole to vent gases), for about an hour, or until doubled in size. You can also use the finger poke test at the one-hour mark so that you can decide whether it needs a few more minutes., Gently de-gas the dough by pressing down on it in the mixing bowl. Use your fingers to shape the dough into a rough rectangle on your work surface, with the long side of the rectangle facing you., Use a rolling pin to roll the dough to about 1/2” thickness., Brush melted butter onto the dough. Do not be shy with the butter! But leave butter off of the top 1.5” of the rectangle. This helps the dough stick to itself when you’re sealing it!, Sprinkle the brown sugar/cinnamon filling over the top of the buttered part of the dough. Use all of it! You want that ooey gooey goodness in your cinnamon rolls! Press down on the cinnamon/sugar filling once it’s sprinkled over the top of the dough., Starting with the long side of the rectangle that is facing you, tightly roll the cinnamon roll. It probably won’t be even, but that’s okay! Work slowly and make sure that the roll is as tight as you can possibly make it., Trim the edges to make the roll an 18-inch log. Cut the log into 1.5” rolls, and place them in a lightly greased 9”x13” baking pan., Cover the baking pan with plastic wrap and allow the cinnamon rolls to proof for 45 minutes. While the cinnamon rolls are rising, heat your oven to a true 350°F., Bake the cinnamon rolls in a 350°F oven for 20-25 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer reads 200°F in the center., While the cinnamon rolls are baking, make the glaze by first adding the room temperature cream cheese to a medium bowl and mixing with a hand mixer until the cream cheese is totally smooth.

Warm the two together until the butter is *just* melted. You want the mixture lukewarm (105°F (41°C)-115°F (46°C)), not scorching hot. Set aside. Whisk the pumpkin puree, sugar, nutmeg, and salt together in a large bowl or in the bowl of your stand mixer. Whisk in the warmed milk/butter, egg, and yeast until combined. Using the dough hook or paddle attachment on low speed or mixing by hand using a silicone spatula or wooden spoon, mix in 1 cup of flour. Mix for 1 minute, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add 1 and 2/3 cups more flour and beat for 1 more minute., Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if using the paddle) and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st Rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), Grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch square baking dish, 9-inch round baking dish, 9×13-inch baking dish, or 11×7-inch baking dish. This recipe yields 10-12 rolls and they can fit into any of those size pans., Roll out the dough:, Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 10×14-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll it out, stop what you’re doing, cover it lightly, and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When you return to the dough, it should stretch out much easier., Add the filling, Spread softened butter evenly on top of the rolled-out dough. Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, and spices into a small bowl. Sprinkle all over the top. Roll it up tightly. Using a very sharp knife, cut into 10-12 even rolls. Arrange rolls in the prepared pan., 2nd Rise, Cover the rolls tightly and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. (Or use the overnight option below.), Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C)., Bake rolls for about 22-28 minutes or until they are lightly browned on top. After about 15 minutes, tent a piece of aluminum foil over the top of the pan to prevent the tops from browning too quickly and baking unevenly. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack for about 10 minutes as you make the icing., Make the icing:, Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the softened cream cheese in a medium bowl on medium speed until smooth. Add the maple syrup and milk and beat on high until smooth. Add the confectioners’ sugar (and cinnamon, if using) and beat on medium speed until creamy.

Mix using the beater blade just until the ingredients are barely combined. Then add in the other 2 cups of flour. Mix until well combined. Allow the mixture to rest for 5 minutes so the flour has time to soak up the liquids. Scrape the dough off the beater blade and remove it. Attach the dough hook., Beat the dough on low speed for 5-7 minutes or until the dough is elastic and smooth. The dough will be tacky and will still be sticking to the sides of the bowl slightly. That's ok! If it really looks too wet, add up to 1/2 more cup of flour as you knead the dough. Just add tablespoon or two at a time. Don't be tempted to add too much flour or it will make the rolls dry. The dough should be slightly sticky., Spray a large bowl with cooking spray.

Preheat the oven to 350º Fahrenheit., Warm the heavy cream until the chill is off. Don’t make it hot…you just don’t want it cold. It should be warm to the touch. Once the rolls have risen, pour the heavy cream over the top of the rolls, allowing it to soak down in and around the rolls., Bake for 27-30 minutes. Check the rolls after about 20 minutes of baking. If they look like they are getting too browned, place a piece of foil over the top of the pan for the remainder of the time. **Note…the time will vary based on how big the rolls are, what type of pan, how close the rolls are packed, etc. To see if they are done, lightly pull up on the edge of the cinnamon roll in the center.

When dough looks ready, place on center rack and bake 35-45 minutes. Tops should look lightly golden brown when the rolls are finished., When done, remove from oven and allow to cool at least 15 minutes., Meanwhile, make the glaze. In your stand mixer, or a large bowl with a hand mixer, cream the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla until fluffy – about 2-3 minutes. Then mix in the eggnog and 2 cups of the powdered sugar, mixing until both are incorporated. Add more powdered sugar or eggnog to achieve desired consistency.

Add the 300g self-raising flour and 280g Greek yogurt into a large bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon or spatula until the mixture resembles large floury lumps. At this stage, get your hands in there and mix it into a rough, cohesive dough. I like to kind of smash the mixture together to break up the lumps of yogurt and bring everything together. Pop it back in the bowl and cover it with a tea towel while you make the pumpkin spice filling., Make the pumpkin spice filling, Add 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon, 2 teaspoons ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom, 1 teaspoon allspice and 1/4 teaspoon of salt into a large mixing bowl. Add the softened butter and dark brown sugar, then mix with a wooden spoon or spatula into a thick paste., Roll out the dough, Dust a flat surface with a little flour to help stop the dough from sticking, then use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, roughly 18″/45cm long and 12″/30cm wide. Don’t worry if your edges are uneven, it’ll be fine. Smooth the pumpkin spice filling out all over the dough. I like to use a knife or the back of a spoon to do this., Roll up the dough, Tightly roll up the dough along the long edge, so you’re left with a long sausage shape. Slice the sausage into 8 roughly equal pieces. Place the cinnamon rolls into the lined dish or cake tin, with the filling side exposed. Pop in the oven for 30 minutes. PRO TIP: Use a serrated or bread knife to cut the cinnamon rolls, and I like to lightly mark the 8 pieces on the dough sausage before I start cutting, so it’s easier to know where to cut to get roughly equal pieces., Make the cream cheese frosting, While the buns are baking, add 100g of cream cheese, 75g icing sugar and 60g softened butter into a large mixing bowl. Using an electric hand whisk (or a handheld whisk), whip the mix into a smooth, creamy icing. Add the chopped stem ginger pieces and the vanilla extract, then whisk again until they’re incorporated. Set aside., Ice the cinnamon rolls, After 30 minutes, the rolls should be looking gorgeously golden, and the filling should be bubbling around the edges. At this point, take them out of the oven. If you can wait, let them sit for about 10 minutes before smoothing the frosting all over the top of the buns (this will prevent the frosting from just melting away into the hot buns). Again, I like to use a knife or the back of a spoon to do this. And you’re done!

Then all at once, add the flour mixture. Attach the dough hook to your mixer and mix on low until the dough starts to become cohesive. With the mixer running on low, slowly add the cubes of butter., Knead on medium speed for about 5 minutes. Alternatively, if you’re doing this by hand, you’ll need to knead the dough for about 10 to 15 minutes. The dough will go from crumbly and separate to completely cohesive and smooth. The dough shouldn’t be sticky. Remove the dough from the hook and the bowl and form it into a ball., Transfer the ball of dough to a clean, lightly greased bowl (I used the flour bowl and just wiped it clean with a kitchen towel and then greased it).

Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/silicone spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula is a better choice.*, On medium speed, beat in the remaining sugar (which should be 1/2 cup/100g) and the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Add the eggs and salt and beat on medium speed until combined. The butter won’t really be mixing into the mixture, so don’t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. Switch the mixer down to low speed and with it running, add 1 cup of flour at a time, making sure it’s fully incorporated before adding the next. After 4 cups have been added, add the last 1/2 cup and beat until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 3 minutes. Dough will be soft., Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st Rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), Grease the bottom and sides of a metal or glass 9×13-inch baking dish or line with parchment paper., Roll out the dough, Punch down the dough to release the air. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and, using a rolling pin, roll into a 10×16-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll it out, stop what you’re doing, cover it lightly, and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When you return to the dough, it should stretch out much easier., For the filling, Spread the softened butter all over the dough. In a small bowl, toss the cinnamon and sugar together until combined and then sprinkle evenly over the dough. Tightly roll up the dough to form a 16 inch long log. If some filling spills out, that’s ok just sprinkle it on top of the rolls. Cut into 8 large rolls (about 2 inches in width each). Arrange them in the prepared baking pan., 2nd Rise, Cover the rolls tightly and allow to rise until puffy, about 2 hours. (Or use the overnight option in the Notes below.), Preheat the oven to 375°F (191°C)., Bake for about 25 minutes or until they are lightly browned on top. About halfway through baking time, tent a piece of aluminum foil over the pan to prevent the tops from browning too quickly. Remove pan from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes as you make the icing., Make the icing, In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until smooth and creamy. Add the confectioners’ sugar, cream/milk, and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 1 minute.

Working from the edge of the rectangle that’s closest to you, start rolling the dough into a log. Do this slowly and carefully, using a rubber spatula and more flour to guide the dough as needed. Pinch the ends into the dough to prevent the log from falling apart., Using a sharp knife, slice the log of dough into 1 ½ - 2-inch pieces. Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray, and place each roll snugly side-by-side. If you have extra rolls that you can’t fit in the pan, place them in another, smaller baking dish coated with cooking spray, such as a loaf pan., Cover rolls with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator overnight., Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Remove plastic wrap from baking pans and bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes. Keep an eye on the rolls towards the end, as you want to make sure the praline filling doesn’t burn., While the rolls are baking, make the frosting. Combine the cream cheese and butter in a small microwavable dish and melt for about 25 seconds, or until you can easily stir the two together. Add bourbon and milk (you can double up on the milk if you want to keep the frosting “virgin”,) stir to combine and microwave for another 10 seconds or so, until the ingredients are easily combined. Stir in the powdered sugar and microwave for 15 more seconds. Set aside., Once rolls are done baking, remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes or so before drizzling on the cream cheese frosting. I added the frosting while the rolls were still in the pan, but you could also remove them and then individually frost them., Serve immediately for best results, although these do reheat well for a couple of days.","[('yeast', 1.0, 'packet'), ('water', 1.0, 'cup'), ('butter', 8.0, 'tablespoons'), ('sugar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('sugar', 0.25, 'cup'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('nutmeg', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('cinnamon', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('eggs', 3.0, None), ('pumpkin', 1.0, 'can'), ('flour', 4.0, 'cups'), ('butter', 5.0, 'tablespoons'), ('sugar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('corn syrup', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('pecans', 2.0, 'cups'), ('cream cheese', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('butter', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('milk', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('bourbon', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('powdered sugar', 2.0, 'cups')]"

Once the dough is formed into a firm ball, cover with a tea towel and allow that to rest for half an hour, and up to an hour., Once the dough is formed into a firm ball, cover with a tea towel and allow that to rest for half an hour, and up to an hour., On a floured working surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle, approximately 10 by 15 inches. Brush the dough with a little bit of oil, then sprinkle on the cinnamon and brown sugar. Using a pizza cutter, slice the dough into 1 inch wide strips. Roll into cinnamon rolls., Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400F., Place the rolls into a greased baking dish or cast iron pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes.

, Measure flour into a small bowl and set it aside. This will help make sure you don't add too much which would give you a stiff dough.
, 	Mix the warm water, 1 tsp of sugar and yeast together in small bowl and let sit for five minutes to bloom the yeast.
, 	In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook (see notes for how to make this without a mixer), add the buttermilk, eggs, the rest of the sugar and salt.
, 	Mix in 1 1/2 cups of the flour and the yeast mixture. As the dough hook brings the flour and liquids together, add the melted butter. You may have to scrape the sides down so that the flour blends in.
, 	When you have a sticky, uniform looking mixture, start added the rest of the flour 1/4 cup at at time. This will take a few minutes. When you have about 1/4 cup of flour left in the bowl, slow the mixer down to minimum and just sprinkle the flour in until you get a ball that can be turned out on a floured counter or board without it being a sticky mess.
, 	With the dough on the floured surface, sprinkle more flour on the dough and knead the dough for two or three minutes. You will use almost all the flour but you may need a bit more or less, depending on the size of your eggs, or humidity in your home. The dough is ready to be placed in a greased bowl when it springs back and isn't sticky when kneaded.
, 	Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel and place in a warm, place for 1 1/2 hours to rise.
, 	When the dough has doubled in size and when you poke your figure in the centre the hole stays, it is ready to be punched down and rolled out.
, 	Just before you roll it out, prepare the filling by melting 1/4 cup of butter in a small bowl in the microwave and mix together the 1/2 cup brown sugar and cinnamon in another bowl. Set that aside.
, 	Melt the 1/2 cup butter in a small pot on the stove whisk together the other 3/4 cup of brown sugar, maple syrup and whipping cream with the butter as it melts. Heat the ingredients until butter until it is just melted and the mixture is uniform with no oily parts of unincorporated melted butter. Try not to let it bubble as this will contribute to the topping hardening later. Pour the mixture into a 9"" x 12"" cake pan or it into two round cake pans. Set the pan or pans aside.
, 	On a lightly floured board, roll the dough into a 14"" x 18"" rectangle using a rolling pin.
, 	Brush the melted butter onto the rectangle evenly leaving a 1/2"" perimeter without butter. Sprinkle the dry brown sugar and cinnamon mixture evenly on the melted butter.
, 	Starting with the long side closest to you, begin rolling the dough away from you. Use your fingers to make sure the dough stays tight and even as you roll it.
, 	With the seam on the board, cut the log into 3 even pieces using a serrated knife. Then cut each third into 4 even pieces.
, 	Holding the seam of each piece, put each piece evenly spaced on the pan prepared with the sticky topping. Place the end pieces cut side down.
, 	Cover the pan (or pans) lightly with plastic wrap and let the buns rise for 45 minutes.
, 	When the oven is preheated to 350 degrees F, bake the buns for approximately 30 minutes or until the outer buns are deep golden brown and the centre buns sound hollow when tapped lightly. Do not over-bake or the sticky topping will harden when the cinnamon buns cool.
, 
, !Instructions for Freezing
, 
, 
, If freezing the dough, cover the pan tightly with two layers of plastic wrap that wraps totally around the pan (otherwise it won't stay on) and freeze until needed.
, 	To thaw: let the buns thaw in the fridge overnight or set the pan on the counter to thaw more quickly.
, 	When the buns have been warmed to room temperature for a half hour, preheat the oven and bake the same as above.

Reduce heat to low and continue to heat the milk for 1 minute, making sure not to let it boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Measure ⅓ cup/80 grams of the hot milk and transfer it to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook., Make the tangzhong: To the saucepan with the remaining milk, add ¼ cup/34 grams of the flour, and whisk vigorously to combine and eliminate any lumps. Return the saucepan to medium heat and cook, whisking constantly and making sure to scrape along the sides, until the mixture has thickened and looks like smooth mashed potatoes, about 1 minute. Remove the saucepan from the heat and scrape the mixture into the stand mixer bowl., Mix the dough: Add the cold water to the stand mixer bowl and whisk to combine, then add the eggs and whisk to break up the whites and yolks. Touch the sides of the bowl — if it’s still warm, pop the bowl in the refrigerator and chill until the mixture is room temperature. Add the yeast and remaining 4 cups/540 grams flour to the bowl and turn the mixer on low speed. Mix until you have a coarsely textured dough, about 5 minutes, then turn off the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Cover the dough and let it rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. Add the sugar and salt, and mix on medium-low speed until incorporated and the dough is very smooth and elastic and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, another 15 to 20 minutes. (This dough requires a long, slow mix so be patient with this step.), Add the butter: Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the butter one piece at a time, waiting for the dough to absorb each piece before adding more, until you have a soft, supple dough, 10 to 15 minutes., Let the dough rise and chill overnight: Lightly butter the inside of a clean, large bowl. Scrape the dough out of the mixer bowl onto the work surface and work it into a ball. Place the dough inside the buttered bowl, seam side down. Cover and let sit at room temperature until it has expanded in size by about 50 percent, 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes. Transfer the bowl to the refrigerator and chill for at least 8 hours and up to 24 (the dough will continue to rise in the refrigerator)., The next day, make the cinnamon filling: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the cookies, Demerara sugar, cinnamon and salt, and pulse until you have very fine, dry crumbs, about 1 minute. (Make sure not to process so much that the mixture starts to look wet.) Transfer the crumbs to a medium bowl and add the butter, then use a flexible spatula to work the crumbs into the butter until you have a smooth paste. Set the filling aside., Prepare the pan: Lightly coat the bottom and sides of a metal 9-by-13-inch pan with room temperature butter, then line the bottom and two longer sides with a piece of parchment paper. Smooth the parchment to eliminate air bubbles, then butter the parchment. Set the pan aside. Lightly butter one side of a piece of aluminum foil large enough to cover the pan and set aside., Roll out the dough: Lightly flour the work surface, then remove the dough from the refrigerator and scrape it out onto the surface. Flatten the dough with the heel of your hand, pressing out some of the built-up gas and working it into a rectangular shape, then use a rolling pin to roll it out, dusting over top and underneath with more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until you have a ⅜-inch-thick rectangle measuring about 20 inches long and 12 inches wide., Fill and roll: Dollop the filling across the surface of the dough, then use a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon to spread it in an even layer all the way to the edge closest to you, leaving a clean ½-inch border on the two shorter sides and the longer side that’s farthest away from you. Try to work reasonably quickly so the dough doesn’t soften too much at room temperature. Starting at the long end closest to you, roll the dough into a snug spiral and rest it on the seam. Starting in the middle, squeeze along the length of the dough to even out the thickness and lengthen it so it’s about 22 inches long. If the dough feels soft and slack (which may happen if your kitchen is warm), slide it onto a piece of parchment paper and then slide the parchment onto a large baking sheet. Refrigerate it until the dough is firm, 10 to 15 minutes, then return to the work surface., Cut the buns, fill the pan and proof: Slide a piece of unflavored dental floss, fishing line or baker’s twine underneath the dough on either end and cut through the spiral, removing a 1-inch-long piece of dough from the ends. Use the floss to cut the dough crosswise into thirds, then cut each third into 5 equal pieces. Arrange the pieces cut sides up in the prepared pan in a 3-by-5 grid. Cover the pan with the foil, buttered side down, and let the buns sit at room temperature until they’re not quite doubled in size, 30 to 60 minutes (peek beneath the foil to check)., Meanwhile, heat the oven: Arrange an oven rack in the center position and heat the oven to 350 degrees., Bake and cool: Make sure the pan is tightly covered with the foil, then transfer to the oven and bake, covered, for 15 minutes. Pull out the pan from the oven slightly and use tongs to remove the foil, then continue to bake until the buns are golden brown all over, another 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and let cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Use a paring knife to cut down between the pan and the buns along the shorter sides to loosen them, then use the parchment paper to lift the buns out of the pan and set them on the wire rack to cool completely., Make the icing and ice the buns: In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, confectioners’ sugar and vanilla, and work with a flexible spatula until the mixture is completely smooth. Add the butter and mix with the spatula, working it against the side of the bowl, until you have a smooth mixture, then switch to a whisk and beat until the icing is light and thick. Dollop the icing over top of the cooled buns and spread with the back of a spoon to cover the surfaces.","[('whole milk', 1.0, 'cup'),  ('flour', 0.25, 'cup'),  ('flour', 4.0, 'cups'),  ('water', 0.25, 'cup'),  ('eggs', 3.0, None),  ('yeast', 1.0, 'teaspoon'),  ('sugar', 0.25, 'cup'),  ('kosher salt', 1.5, 'teaspoons'),  ('unsalted butter', 8.0, 'tablespoons'),  ('speculoos cookies', 4.0, 'ounces'),  ('demerara sugar', 0.5, 'cup'),  ('cinnamon', 1.0, 'tablespoon'),  ('kosher salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'),  ('unsalted butter', 12.0, 'tablespoons'),  ('cream cheese', 4.0, 'ounces'),  ('confectioners sugar', 1.0, 'cup'),  ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'tablespoon'),  ('unsalted butter', 6.0, 'tablespoons')]"

Any hotter and the yeast could die. I always use an instant-read thermometer to be sure., Once heated, pour milk into a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Stir or whisk in the yeast until dissolved. Let sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy. If you see no bubbles, the yeast was either killed or may be bad and you'll need to start over with fresh yeast., Add sugar, butter, salt, and eggs to yeast mixture and thoroughly combine., If using a stand mixer for kneading, add in the yeast mixture and 3 cups of flour to the mixer bowl and attach to the mixer with the dough hook. Turn on to the appropriate dough setting and wait for the flour to be thoroughly mixed in. Add the remaining cup of flour, adding more, if needed, a tablespoon at a time, continuing to run the mixer until the dough forms a ball in the bowl and is elastic - about 10 minutes., If kneading by hand, add all 4 cups of flour and stir or mix with your hands until the dough has come together enough to knead. Place dough on a lightly floured clean surface and knead for 5-10 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic, adding more flour as needed to prevent sticking., If desired, lightly mix or knead in raisins and pecans., Lightly oil or spray a large clean bowl. Shape dough into a large ball, place upside down in the oiled bowl to coat, then turn right-side up, cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel, and leave to rise until doubled in a warm place 1 - 2 hours., Once the dough has doubled, thoroughly punch it down and then turn it out onto a lightly floured surface., Using a rolling pin, or pat with your hands, roll out the dough into approximately a 16 x 21-inch rectangle (the long side facing you), adding a bit more flour if it starts to stick., Spread softened butter all over the rolled out dough and then sprinkle evenly with brown sugar and cinnamon., Starting with the side closest to you, begin rolling the dough tightly to the top edge. Pinch the top edge to the dough roll, and then roll over the roll so that the pinched edge is now on the bottom., At this point, you can cut the rolls into whatever size you desire with a knife, unflavored floss or thread. I usually just use a serrated knife., Place the rolls into a pan that has been sprayed with non-stick spray. I find that the rolls bake up best in a 9 x 13 baking dish or 2 cake pans. Having the filling ooze out can be a common problem with cinnamon rolls and I find the best solution is to leave just a bit of room for the rolls to rise and double so they will be touching and supporting each other., Cover pan(s) of rolls with plastic wrap or a clean towel and allow to rise until doubled in size in a warm area - about 30 minutes to 1 hour. I usually make my cinnamon rolls the day before and stick the pan in the fridge at this point to slowly rise overnight. Then I set them out on the counter for about 1 - 2 hours first thing in the morning., While rolls rise, preheat your oven to 400°F. For extra gooey cinnamon rolls pour 1/2 cup heavy cream directly over the rolls and let sit at least 5 minutes before baking. The rolls won't completely absorb the cream until baked., Once preheated, bake the rolls for about 15-20 minutes, or more depending on how large you made yours, until golden brown., In the meantime, make the frosting by beating together the softened cream cheese, butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt., One rolls are browned, remove from the oven and slather with frosting. You may want to let them cool a few minutes before frosting as it will melt., Serve and enjoy!, Cover and refrigerate any leftovers for up to 3 days. Frosted rolls can also be frozen.

If working without a stand mixer strengthen knead the dough by hand for the same amount of time., Bulk Fermentation, Cover the bowl with a damp cloth to bulk ferment the dough at 71°F(21°C) for 8-10 hours, or overnight. The dough will need to rise until it is double its original size. It’s important to note that rise times can vary based on the temperature in your home, so adjust the time accordingly., Make the filling, First brown the butter. Add the butter for the filling to a small sauce pan over medium heat and cook until melted., Continue to cook over medium heat, stirring continuously, until the butter browns and takes on a warm nutty aroma. This should take about 5 minutes., In a small mixing bowl combine the brown butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and all-purpose flour. Set the prepared cinnamon-sugar filling aside., Make the Rolls, Before turning out the dough, lightly dust your work surface with flour. Gently pat the dough into a square shape and use a floured rolling pin to roll it out into a 16″x16″ rectangle., Spread the prepared brown butter filling mixture evenly over the sheet of sweet dough, leaving a one-inch margin along the length of the dough. This margin will help to seal the rolls when you roll up the dough., Spread the prepared brown butter filling mixture evenly over the sheet of sweet dough, leaving a one-inch margin along the length of the dough. This margin will help to seal the rolls when you roll up the dough., Once the filling is spread, roll dough up tightly into a log. Start with the end opposite of the margin and roll inwards applying a gentle pressure., Lightly wet the margin with water before sealing the dough. Allow the roll to rest, seam side down, for a minute to ensure a tight seal., Using a non-serrated knife, cut the log into twelve equally-sized cinnamon rolls. Wetting your knife every few cuts will prevent the dough from pulling and give clean slices., Second Rise, Arrange the cut rolls in a 9″x13″ pan, ensuring they are evenly spaced apart. If preferred, using a slightly smaller pan will yield doughier cinnamon rolls. Place a cloth or kitchen towel over the pan, ensuring the rolls are well covered., Let them rise at a temperature of around 71°F (21°C) for one to two hours. During this second rise, the rolls will increase in size and become visibly poofy. It’s important to note that rise times can vary based on the temperature in your home, so adjust the time accordingly. See notes for a way to speed up second rise times., Bake and Frost, Position your rolls on the center rack of a 350°F (177°C) preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes., While the rolls are baking, prepare the frosting. Start by browning the butter just as you did with the butter for the filling., Add the cold cream cheese and hot brown butter to a medium sized mixing bowl. Using the back end of a fork, mash together the butter and cream cheese until mostly combined., Add the powdered sugar and using an electric mixer, fully combined it with the cream cheese butter mixture. Add the milk and mix until it is creamy and velvety in consistency., Once the rolls are out of the oven allow them to cool for 15 minutes before frosting.

Set aside for 10-15 minutes, or until the mixture starts frothing.Tip: If using instant yeast, you don’t need to activate it. Instead, just add it straight to the dry ingredients along with the sugar. Add the milk that would be used in activating the active dried yeast to the dry ingredients along with the psyllium gel, vegan condensed milk and melted vegan butter., Make the psyllium gel: In a separate bowl, mix together the psyllium husk and water. After about 30-45 seconds, a gel will form., For the following steps, I recommend using a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. You can also make the dough by hand, but the mixer makes it much easier and results in a smoother dough., In the bowl of the stand mixer, whisk together the tapioca starch, millet flour, sorghum flour, xanthan gum, salt, baking powder and the remaining sugar., Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and add the vegan condensed milk, melted vegan butter, yeast mixture and psyllium gel., Knead the dough until smooth and all the ingredients are evenly incorporated, then knead for a further 5 minutes (if using a stand mixer) or 8-10 minutes (if kneading it by hand). Use a rubber spatula to occasionally scrape along the sides and bottom of the bowl to prevent any dry patches of unmixed flour.Tip: This extra kneading time will make the dough EXTRA smooth, which is the key to perfect gluten free vegan cinnamon rolls., The final dough will be soft and very slightly sticky to the touch, but if you give it a quick, gentle knead on a lightly floured surface, you’ll see that it’s very easy to work with. Just make sure that your work surface and your hands are floured as you handle it.Tip: If the dough feels too soft to handle, you can chill it in the fridge for about 1 hour – but in my experience, that's not necessary with this specific dough., Rolling out the dough & shaping the cinnamon rolls:, Lightly brush a 9x13 inch (23x33cm) rectangular baking pan with some of the melted vegan butter., On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into an approximately 12x18 inch (30x45cm) rectangle., Brush it generously with melted vegan butter. You will probably have some butter leftover – you can use that to brush the baked rolls once they come out of the oven (see below)., Mix together the cinnamon and sugar, and sprinkle the mixture evenly over the rolled-out dough., Cut the rectangle widthways into twelve 1½ inch (3.8cm) wide strips, so that they’re 12 inches (30cm) long. I like to use a pizza cutter for this, but a sharp knife will also work well., Roll up each individual strip into a roll – this will give you the perfect swirl., Arrange the cinnamon rolls in the buttered baking pan, they should only just touch each other., Proofing the cinnamon rolls:, Proof the cinnamon rolls in a warm place for about 1 hour – 1 hour 15 minutes or until about doubled in volume. Lightly cover them with a sheet of plastic wrap (cling film) to prevent them from drying out during proofing.Tip: If your kitchen is on the cold side, you can proof them in a lukewarm oven (the ideal proofing temperature is around 79ºF/26ºC)., Baking the cinnamon rolls:, While the rolls are proofing, adjust the oven rack to the middle position and pre-heat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC).Tip: Note that the oven temperature above refers to a conventional/non-fan oven. If you’re using a convection/fan oven, reduce this temperature by 25ºF (20ºC). This is a general rule of thumb that holds true for most recipes. I don't really recommend using the fan oven setting for this recipe, so if possible, use a conventional/non-fan oven., Once the cinnamon rolls have doubled in volume, bake them in the pre-heated oven at 350ºF (180ºC) for about 30 minutes until light golden brown on top. This gives cinnamon rolls that are perfectly baked through but are also perfectly squishy and soft., Immediately out of the oven, brush the cinnamon rolls with a bit of extra melted vegan butter. This makes them extra rich and ensures that they have a perfectly soft exterior., Allow the cinnamon rolls to cool until warm before spreading the icing on top., Simple vanilla icing:, Combine all the icing ingredients in a bowl and whisk them together until smooth and no clumps remain., You can adjust the consistency of the icing if necessary. Add more powdered/icing sugar if you want to make it thicker, or more non-dairy milk if you want to make it runnier/looser., Pour or drizzle the icing evenly over the warm cinnamon rolls, and then spread it out with the back of a spoon., Serve and enjoy!, Serving and storage:, These gluten free vegan cinnamon rolls are still perfectly soft even 6 hours after baking! I do recommend eating them on the day of baking and they’re definitely at their very best still slightly warm.However, you can keep them in a closed air-tight container at room temperature until the next day. Then, just before serving, re-heat them briefly in the microwave for 15-20 seconds. This will return them to their original pillowy softness., Overnight, make-ahead options:, Option 1: You can prepare the dough and then keep it in the fridge overnight (in a closed container or in a covered bowl). You can then roll, shape, proof and bake the cinnamon rolls the next day., Option 2: You can make the dough and shape the cinnamon rolls, and then keep the tightly covered baking pan in the fridge overnight. The next day, bring the rolls to room temperature. If they haven’t doubled in size by the time they’ve reached room temperature, proof them for a while longer – and then, bake according to the recipe.","[('active dried yeast', 12.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 75.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 180.0, 'g'), ('milk', 180.0, 'g'), ('psyllium husk', 30.0, 'g'), ('water', 360.0, 'g'), ('tapioca starch', 315.0, 'g'), ('millet flour', 270.0, 'g'), ('sorghum flour', 50.0, 'g'), ('xanthan gum', 10.0, 'g'), ('salt', 10.0, 'g'), ('baking powder', 12.0, 'g'), ('vegan condensed milk', 100.0, 'g'), ('vegan butter', 70.0, 'g'), ('vegan butter', 70.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 100.0, 'g'), ('ground cinnamon', 1.5, 'tbsp'), ('powdered sugar', 180.0, 'g'), ('milk', 30.0, 'g'), ('vanilla bean paste', 1.0, 'tsp')]"

Using aBench Scraperor averysharp knife, cut it into 6 rolls (about 2"" sections). *Note:you can cut it into 9 rolls, they will just be slightly smaller and not the big fluffy cinnamon rolls as the 6., Grease or line your pan (a 9 inch circle or 8x8 square pan) withParchment Paper. If using parchment paper and a round pan, crumble it up into a ball and then smooth it out… it will make it easier to smooth into shape. Put the rolls in it and allow them to rest for two hours in a warm spot, covered. If your house is on the cooler side, I recommend putting on the oven light and letting them sit in there for this proofing stage. You can then bake them or put them in the fridge overnight and bake the next morning (my preference in order to allow for a longer ferment and reduce the gluten content)., The next morning, preheat oven to 350 and bake for 30-35 min or until golden brown on top. Cool for 15 minutes. While cooling, make the glaze and drizzle on top of the cinnamon rolls. These are best enjoyed warm from the oven but can be reheated if needed.

Use a thermometer to check the temperature of the milk. It should be warm but not hot to the touch. Pour the warmed milk into the bowl of a stand mixer (or a large mixing bowl) and add the yeast., Add the egg, melted butter, flour, sugar, and salt and mix until the ingredients are blended. Let the mixture stand for 5 minutes (to give the flour time to hydrate)., Using the stand mixer's dough hook attachment, beat on medium speed until a sticky dough forms. Increase speed to medium-high and beat for another 5 minutes, or until the dough is soft and smooth. (NOTE: If not using a stand mixer with a hook attachment, knead the dough by hand for about 10 minutes, or until a soft and smooth dough forms.), Knead the dough gently with your hands on a lightly floured surface for 1 minute before gently forming the dough into a ball. Transfer the ball of dough to a lightly greased bowl and cover the bowl with a clean dish towel., Place the dough in a warm spot and let it rise until doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes., Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour or up to overnight., Remove the dough from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature while you prepare the filling. Lightly grease a quarter baking sheet or a 9 inch round metal cake pan and set aside., Prep the cinnamon filling., In a small bowl, whisk together the sugars and spices. Set aside., Shape the cinnamon rolls., Place the dough onto a lightly floured surface and, using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a rectangle that's 9 inches x 12 inches. (TIP: Use a bench scraper to gently nudge the edges of the rolled dough to form a perfect rectangle.), Use a small spatula to spread the softened butter over the rectangle of dough. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly over the butter, covering the dough all the way to the edges., Beginning at the short (9 inch) end of the rectangle of dough, roll the dough tightly to form a log that's 9 inches long., Slice the log into 6 equal pieces. (TIP: I like to cut cinnamon rolls using unflavored dental floss - wrap it around the log of dough, cross the two ends over each other, and pull taught to slice the dough without squashing it.), Place the rolls cut side up onto your baking sheet or pan., Cover the pan with a clean dish towel and place it in a warm spot until the rolls have doubled in size, about 20 to 30 minutes., While the rolls rise, position the oven rack in the bottom third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375ºF., Bake the cinnamon rolls., Once the rolls have risen, pour heavy cream over them immediately before baking., Bake the rolls for 15-20 minutes, or until they're golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a roll comes out clean with no raw dough. (NOTE: If the rolls become golden brown before they're finished baking, carefully place a sheet of aluminum foil over the rolls to keep them from over-browning as they continue to bake.) Remove the baked rolls from the oven, and allow them to cool slightly on a wire rack while you prepare the cream cheese icing., Make the cream cheese icing., Add the cream cheese and butter to a medium bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Using an electric hand mixer or stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter until smooth and combined. Add the salt and vanilla and beat until combined.

Allow mixture to sit until yeast starts to foam/bubble on top, around 8-10 minutes., Meanwhile, combine butter and milk over medium-high heat on the stove, stirring occasionally until butter has melted, but making sure not to let them come to a boil. Remove from heat and set aside., Next, stir flour and salt together in a large bowl and set aside., Pour melted butter and milk into the bowl with the yeast and stir to combine, then pour the liquid ingredients into the bowl with the flour. Use a wooden spoon to stir mixture together for at least 1 minute, or knead dough with your hands for 2-3 minutes. The dough will be a little sticky and that's ok., Grease a separate large bowl with a bit of coconut oil, and then transfer dough into that bowl. Place a towel over the bowl, and then put the bowl in the oven and allow the dough to rise and double in size, about 1 hour. NOTE: to ensure my dough rises, I usually heat my oven to 200°, then turn it OFF and put the bowl in the warm oven., Right before the hour has passed, make the filling. Start by melting butter, and setting it aside, then combine cinnamon, cocoa and espresso in a separate bowl and set them aside as well., Remove dough from the oven (it should be double in size, or at least close) and stir in an additional 1/3 cup flour. This will make the dough less sticky and easier to roll out., Next, set up your work space. Flour a baking mat (or your kitchen table), and then use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a rectangle, being careful not to let the dough get too thin. Brush the dough with the melted butter, leaving about a 1/2 inch border around the edges. Next, sprinkle the sugar on top, then the cinnamon, cocoa and espresso mixture, using your hands to press everything gently into the dough., Starting with the short side of the rectangle, gently roll the dough up into a short, fat log. Then, using a knife, cut the log into 1"" cinnamon rolls, placing them cut side down into a baking pan. You should end up with about 10 larger rolls., Once all the rolls are cut, cover the dish back up with the towel and place the dish back in the oven, allowing the rolls to rise for 30 minutes., Once the 30 minutes have passed, remove rolls from the oven (but keep the towel on top) and preheat the oven to 350°., Bake rolls for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until dough has set and cinnamon is bubbling., While rolls are baking, make the icing by combining the powdered sugar and milk together with an electric mixer until icing is smooth., Once rolls are done, drizzle icing over top and sprinkle with chopped chocolate.

Add both packages of active dry yeast to water (do not mix). Put the bowl onto a thick dish towel or in the oven with the light on (without heat). Must be in a warm place to let stand to get foamy.

Then add the sugar, warm water, warm almond milk, and salt., Once mixture has cooled, add the eggs (you do not want to cook the eggs in too hot of liquid). Then add the yeast mixture., Begin adding one cup of flour at a time. Once you have added about 4.5-5 cups, the mixture will be too tough to mix with a spatula. Switch to using your hands and begin kneading the dough for approx 8 minutes, until the dough looks smooth and doesn't fall through your fingers while holding it., Grease a large bowl all around the sides (bowl must be 3 times the size of the dough).

Sprinkle the 3/4 cup packed brown sugar evenly over the butter, then finish with 2 tsp cinnamon., Starting at the long end, roll the dough up. Once it's tight, pinch the ends so the rolls stay together. For bigger cinnamon rolls, cut into 2.5 inch pieces and for smaller cut into 1.5 inch pieces. You can use dental floss or a very sharp serrated knife. Follow same steps for other half of remaining dough., Grease a few baking dishes. For bigger buns I use round baking cake pans or 9 x 13 baking dishes. Leave lots of room between the buns as they rise again. Cover with tee towel and put back in the oven for a second rise with light on and heat off. They may take 45-60 minutes and will double in size again., In a medium size bowl, whisk the full fat coconut milk, brown sugar and cinnamon then set aside. This mixture will continue to thicken as it sits. In a separate bowl, use an electric mixer to cream together the vegan cream cheese and vegan butter. Add in icing sugar and vanilla. Put frosting in the refrigerator till the cinnamon buns are cooked., Preheat oven to 350F. Pour the coconut milk glaze mixture evenly over the cinnamon rolls. Uncovered, bake for 18-20 minutes., Let cool in the pan for 3 minutes, then invert onto a serving platter or large plate. Scrape remaining filling from the pan onto the rolls.

Heat on high for 1 minute, then remove and stir. Continue heating in 20 second intervals, pausing after each to stir, until the butter is melted and the milk is warm to the touch but not hot. If needed, let the milk mixture sit for a few minutes until it is warm but not hot., In the bowl of a stand mixer (*see note below for an alternative method of making this by hand*) fitted with the dough hook attachment, add 3 cups flour, yeast, sugar and salt. Stir by hand to combine. Add the egg and milk mixture, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. Add the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, beating after each addition until incorporated. When the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, you have added enough flour. Continue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the dough hook and cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes., Meanwhile, begin making your filling by whisking together sugars and cinnamon in a bowl until combined., When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Then use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 14 x 9 inches in size. (If you want all edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into a perfect rectangle. Don’t worry about cutting away extra dough — this recipe makes plenty.) Use a knife or pastry spatula to spread the softened butter out evenly over the entire surface of the dough. Then sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon and sugar mixture. Then sprinkle on the finely chopped apples, and drizzle with 1/2 cup caramel sauce., Beginning at the 14-inch edge, tightly roll up the dough. And then give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss* to “cut” off the two ends of the roll (just a centimeter or so) so that they are even. Then cut the remaining dough into 11 or 12 equal pieces. (11 rolls seem to fit in a pie plate, while 12 rolls fit in a rectangular pan.), (*To cut dough with dental floss, simply break off a piece of floss about 12 inches long. Then very carefully slide the middle of the floss under the dough to the place where you want to “cut”. Then pull the ends of the floss up and cross over the top of the dough. Then give a quick tug to literally cut all the way through the dough. This is the best method for not squishing your dough while cutting it — although the standard knife method still works too.), Place each of the cut cinnamon rolls into a greased pie plate or 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Then cover again with a damp towel, and leave the dish in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes. (I typically turn on my oven to 200 degrees, then turn it off and place the dish in the oven with the door cracked open. It’s a great option if you don’t have a vent or a warm window nearby.), When the rolls have risen, uncover the dish. Then place on the center rack of the oven and bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes, or until the rolls are golden and cooked through. Remove and let cool on a wire rack for at least 5 minutes.

Whisk to combine., Stir the yeast mixture into the flour, followed by the melted butter. Stir until a dough forms., Next, make the apple filling: in a small skillet, add diced apple, butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. Turn the heat to medium and cook until the apples soften. The sugar should caramelize and bubble. When the apples are done, stir in the heavy cream and cook until the sauce thickens slightly and resembles apples in caramel sauce. Scrape the sauce into a bowl, but don't clean the skillet., Roll the dough out into a rectangle about 8"" by 4""., Evenly spread the apple filling mixture over the dough.

Melt the butter and sugar over medium heat. Let the sugar lightly caramelize around the edges, stirring occasionally. When the sugar is a golden color, stir in all of the heavy cream at once--be careful, it can splatter., Stir the caramel sauce as it thickens. Remove from heat and stir in the powdered sugar.

The water needs to be at a temperature of around 100°F for the yeast to activate so it’s best to use a thermometer. Allow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes. It should double in size and be foamy at the top., Meanwhile, melt your coconut oil or butter over low heat. Ensure it's also not heated above 100°F., Combine flour with sea salt in a large mixing bowl. Then create a well in the middle of the flour and pour the water and yeast mixture and the oil into it., If you're using quick rise yeast, add the yeast and sugar in with the flour and sea salt and stir to combine. In this instance you will need water between 120°F and 130°F. Create a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and add 1 tablespoon of oil and the water., In both instances, once everything is in the bowl, fold the dough gently to combine it with a spatula until it comes together to form a ball that is slightly sticky. Flour your surface and hands and place the dough on the surface. Press with your fingers and wrists and fold onto itself, kneading 10 to 15 times until the dough is slightly sticky., Again, if you've used a different flour you might need to add up to 1 cup of extra flour if your dough is too sticky. However, only add a small amount at a time as you don't want to add too much flour or it will make the dough tough. If it starts sticking to you hands, lightly flour them and your surface as you knead., Lightly oil the mixing bowl with 1 teaspoon of oil or vegan butter. It's fine if there are remnants in the bowl from mixing. Lightly flour the outside of the ball of dough and place it in the bowl. If you used active yeast, you will need to proof it for 1 to 2 hours in a warm dark place. Cover it with a damp towel and place somewhere like the top of the fridge or in the oven or microwave, away from any cool drafts. The dough will double in size., If you used quick rise yeast, let the dough rest for 10 to 20 minutes with a damp towel over the bowl. Then proceed with making the filling and shaping the rolls., Meanwhile, combine sugar and cinnamon for the filling and set aside., Melt 2 tablespoons of coconut oil or vegan butter in the pan you want to bake the cinnamon rolls in, then you can use the residue to grease all sides of the pan., Once dough has proofed, lightly flour a clean dry surface/countertop and roll out the dough to approx. a 16” x 16” square., Brush melted coconut oil or butter on the surface of the dough. Leave one 1"" edge clean with no oil or butter. Then sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly on top. At this point, add any fillings, like more pecans or whatever you like, on top of this cinnamon sugar mixture (optional)., Start at the opposite side of the clean edge and roll the dough into a log shape. Take a sharp knife and cut 12 equal rolls., Place the rolls in the greased pan leaving space between the rolls and the edge of the pan. Cover the pan in plastic wrap and a tea towel and allow the rolls to proof in a warm dark place for another 2 hours. I've also left them overnight in the warm dark place and they're fine. Bake them the following morning as soon as possible. NOTE: do not put these in the fridge to rise. While I have done it once and it worked, it seems to be an unreliable method., Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake the rolls for 25 to 30 minutes., To make the caramel, combine the ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk occasionally for 7 to 8 minutes as it thickens. Remove from the heat.

Start the mixer and let the flour absorb., Gradually add more flour, a little bit at a time until the dough is less sticky and pulls away from the side of the bowl. You want the bread dough to be slightly sticky, but not too much. When you touch the dough, it should bounce back slightly. Be sure to leave the mixer on for several minutes after you get the right consistency., Add dough to a bowl. Grease a large bowl with canola oil. Add dough to the greased bowl, making sure you smooth it into a ball, by punching it down – starting in the center of the dough.

Leaving the caramel alone at any point can cause it to burn., Place sugar in a heavy-bottomed medium sauce pot. Make sure the sides of the pot come up a little bit (that it’s not a shallow pan) because it will boil up when you add the cream later., Place the pan over medium-low heat. Cook stirring often, but being careful not to spread the sugar up the sides of the pan too much. The sugar will become a little bit liquidy, form clumps, then finally melt into a light amber liquid. Keep stirring until the liquid is amber in color. This will take about 7-12 minutes, depending on your pot and the heat of your stove. DO NOT LEAVE THE SUGAR ALONE, it will burn fast., Once the liquid turns amber, add the butter and stir until it’s melted. Add half of the heavy whipping cream, stir, then add the rest. It will bubble up as you add it to the mixture. Turn off the heat and then stir in the, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt, if using. Stir until smooth. You may need to whisk it to get out all the clumps., Pour the caramel carefully into a jar and let cool to room temperature. It will thicken as it cools. Cover and store in the refrigerator. When ready to use, remove the lid and heat in 30 second increments until the caramel is melted and smooth and the desired consistency (about 60-90 seconds for the just-made texture). Will keep for 2 weeks in the refrigerator.","[('sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('butter', 5.0, 'tablespoons'), ('whipping cream', 0.75, 'cup'), ('cinnamon', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', None, None)]"

Remove saucepan from heat., To the saucepan with the tangzhong (flour paste), whisk in the melted butter and milk until very smooth. Add in the eggs and whisk until fully incorporated. The liquid ingredients will cool off the hot tangzhong and the mixture should now feel lukewarm., In the bowl of a stand mixer (or a large bowl if kneading by hand) whisk together the flour, powdered milk, and yeast to combine. Pour in the flour paste/milk mixture., Fit the stand mixer with the dough hook and mix on low speed until all the flour is moistened and a shaggy dough comes together; 1 to 2 minutes. Let the dough rest, covered, for 20 minutes; this will give the flour a chance to absorb the liquid, making it easier to knead., After the 20 minutes, add the sugar and salt and mix on medium-low speed until a smooth, elastic and slightly sticky dough forms; about 10 minutes. The dough will be very sticky when mixing begins, but resist the urge to add more flour; the dough will absorb the excess moisture and come together nicely as the mixing progresses. After the 10 minutes of kneading, the dough should feel slightly sticky but not messy and should easily come together in a taut ball when handled with lightly oiled hands., Using lightly oiled hands, shape the dough into a ball, and transfer to a lightly greased large bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place, until almost doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Alternatively, you can let it rise slowly in the fridge overnight; my personal favorite method, as a cold dough is so much easier to work with. Meanwhile, prepare the filling., In a medium bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon and salt until well combined, Cover with plastic wrap and set aside until ready to use., Gently deflate the risen dough, then turn out onto a pastry mat or very lightly floured counter. Pat, stretch and roll out the dough to form 16X18-inch rectangle with long edge nearest you., Evenly spread the partially melted butter all over the surface of the dough, then sprinkle the brown sugar filling over the butter, leaving 1-inch border along top edge; smooth the filling into an even layer with your hand, then gently press mixture into dough to adhere., Starting with long edge nearest you, roll the dough into a cylinder. Pinch the seam to seal the dough shut and roll cylinder seam side down. Mark gently with a knife to create 12 equal portions. For the cleanest cut, slice by holding a strand of dental floss underneath the cylinder, and cross ends of the floss over each other and pull. Slice cylinder into 12 portions (about 2 inches each) and transfer to a 15X13-inch rimmed baking sheet or 13X9-inch baking pan, that's been greased with cooking spray., Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap and allow the rolls to rise until puffy and the rolls are touching one another; 40 to 50 minutes . In the last 15 minutes of rising, adjust oven rack to medium position and preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C. Meanwhile, prepare the frosting., In a medium bowl (or food processor), using an electric mixer, beat together the butter and cream cheese until very smooth and creamy; about 2 minutes., With the mixer running, gradually add in the powdered sugar. Continue beating, until the sugar is fully incorporated and the mixture is light and fluffy; about 2 more minutes., Add in the milk, lemon juice, vanilla and salt, and beat until well combined. Cover until needed., Remove the plastic wrap from over the risen rolls and bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, tenting with aluminum foil halfway through baking to avoid over browning. The rolls are done when the center of the dough registers around 190F on an instant read thermometer, or when a toothpick inserted in the center of the roll, should go in and out smoothly, meet no resistance and come out clean.., Remove the rolls from the oven, and immediately spread the tops with the frosting; it'll partially melt into the rolls.

I did 15 second increments, and it was about 45 seconds. You can also use the stovetop., With mixer paddle attachment running, slowly add your milk mixture to flour until combined. Add egg (for flaxseed “egg”) until dough starts to come together., Change attachment to dough hook and knead dough for about 5 minutes. You may need to add a bit more flour here,1/4-1/2 cup. Dough should be elastic and start to pull away from edge of bowl when it is ready., Oil large bowl and shape dough into ball, place dough in bowl and cover with oiled plastic wrap (or lid) and let rest and rise until ball of dough has doubled in size, about 45 minutes., While the dough is rising, you can combine the 1/4 cup coconut sugar and 1.5 TBS of ground cinnamon in a small bowl and set aside. If your coconut oil is not soft, place jar in bowl of warm water., Once dough has doubled in size, lightly cover rolling pin and surface with flour. Roll out dough into a 15×12 inch rectangle. (Be patient, and roll gently. If you’re new to this it could take some practice! Don’t use too much flour or your dough will be stiff.) Spread coconut oil on dough with small spatula (or your hands), and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar., Using a pizza cutter, cut dough into 7 strips, about 1 3/4″ wide. Loosely roll dough strips up into swirls (see second picture in post) and place swirl side down in greased 9″ pie dish, leaving some space in between. They don’t need to be packed in, you should have just enough room for 6 rolls on the outside and 1 roll in the middle (see pictures in post)., Cover rolls loosely with aluminum foil and allow to rise for 30 more minutes in a warm, draft-free environment. *PRO TIP: Turn oven on to 200F, shut off and let rolls rise in warm oven, Once the rolls have risen again slightly, preheat oven to 350F (take rolls out and wait for oven to get up to 350F). Bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes, until lightly browned. Then, if necessary, cover top of rolls with foil and bake for an additional 5 minutes. Covering the rolls for the last 5-10 minutes will prevent them from getting too brown on the top. My rolls took 30 minutes total., Once rolls have cooled for about 10 minutes, cover with Healthier Salted Caramel Sauce., Rolls are best enjoyed fresh, but can be stored in airtight container at room temperature up to 2 days. Rolls can also be wrapped individually in plastic wrap, then covered with foil and stored in freezer up to 2 weeks. Thaw at room temperature, or in microwave.","[('whole wheat white flour', 3.0, 'cups'), ('coconut sugar', 2.0, 'tbs'), ('salt', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('instant yeast', 1.0, 'packet'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('non-dairy milk', 1.0, 'cup'), ('water', 1.0, 'cup'), ('coconut oil', 1.0, 'tbs'), ('coconut sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('ground cinnamon', 1.5, 'tbs'), ('coconut oil', 2.0, 'tbs')]"

Place yeast, water, and milk in the bowl of stand mixer and using a spatula, stir until yeast is dissolved., Add flour and salt and fit the mixer with the dough hook. Turn mixer on the lowest setting to avoid flour flying up. Turn mixer on and off in a few short pulses, just to dampen the flour. Increase mixer speed to medium-low and mix 2 minutes, just until flour is moistened. At this point, you will have a fairly shaggy mass. Scrape sides and bottom of the bowl with rubber spatula. Set mixer to low and add eggs one at a time, followed by sugar and vanilla bean paste., Increase mixer speed to medium and beat for 3 minutes, until dough forms a ball. Reduce speed to low and add butter 2 tablespoons at a time, beating until each piece is almost incorporated before adding the next. You will have a dough that is almost batter-like in texture. Increase speed to medium-high and continue to beat until dough pulls away from sides of the bowl, about 10 minutes., Lightly butter another mixing bowl and transfer dough to it. Cover with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature until nearly doubled in size, about 40 – 60 minutes, depending on how warm the kitchen is., Deflate the dough by lifting up the edges and letting fall into the middle of the bowl.

Save rest of butter for remaining dough., In a medium sized bowl add the diced apple with the sugar and cinnamon.  Stir gently to combine.   Evenly scatter half of the apples over the dough;  save the remaining apples for the other half of the dough., Starting at the longest side, roll tightly into a log. Using a long piece of unflavored dental floss, loop under the log of dough and pull up and criss-cross ends to cut into 1/2-inch thick circles. You can cut the rolls into larger circles if you want bigger rolls. Place into baking pan, barely touching. You may need to adjust a bit. Cover with plastic wrap and drape a couple flour towels over the top of the plastic wrap., Repeat with the remaining dough, butter and apple mixture., Set aside in warm room and let rise until doubled, about 30 – 60 minutes. The time depends on how warm your kitchen is., Preheat the oven to 350 while the rolls are rising., Once the rolls have risen, bake them for 20 – 30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven. Let sit for 5 minutes and then frost and serve., For the frosting:, In mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and butter until light and fluffy. Add sifted powdered sugar and mix well, then add the caramel sauce.  Mix until smooth.

This step to to activate the yeast and make sure it’s still good. If mixture doesn’t look foamy, discard and start over with new yeast., Fit the stand mixer with the dough hook attachment and add butter, eggs and salt, then mix on LOW speed until combined. Gradually add in the flour, in about 1 cup increments. When all the flour has been added, increase mixer speed to about MED, and mix about 5 minutes, or until a soft dough forms., Dough should be soft and smooth, slightly tacky but not sticky.

Spread this dough with half the butter mixture and roll it up from the long side. Repeat with the other half of the dough and the remainder of the crust filling. Place the rolls on a cutting board and place them in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes., Remove one roll from the freezer and cut it into 1/4-inch thick slices (just as if you were making cinnamon buns). Fill a pie pan with the slices, covering the bottom and sides (the pieces should have a little space between them). Press the slices together so that they form a pie shell. Transfer the pie pan to the freezer., Take the other roll out of the freezer and cut it in the same way, but arrange the pieces in a circle (large enough to cover the top of the pie pan) on top of a sheet of parchment paper. Place another sheet of parchment paper on top and roll the sheet to make all the slices stick together. If the slices don't want to adhere, you can brush a little water between them. Peel the top sheet of parchment paper off., Take the pie shell out of the freezer and pour in the apple filling. Brush the edge with a little water and add the top crust. It is easiest to leave the crust on the remaining bottom sheet of parchment paper and place it over the pie filling, paper-side up, and then peel off the parchment. Cut away any overhang, leaving a rim about 1 1/4-inch wide if you want to make a decorative edge.

Using your dough hook, mix dough on low to medium speed until it begins to come together. Increase speed to medium-high and mix until you have a soft, but not overly sticky dough. It will stick to the bottom of the bowl a bit but it should be smooth. See photos above for reference., Remove dough hook. Cover mixing bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel and allow to rise for an hour in a warm place., Filling:, In a small bowl, mix all filling ingredients with a spoon or silicon spatula until thoroughly combined., Frosting:, In a medium bowl, mix all frosting ingredients with a hand mixer until combined and fluffy.

This will give you the most hypnotically swirled rolls with a great filling to dough ratio. Once you reach the end, pinch along seam to seal., Cut roll in half, then each half into 6 equal pieces. You will have 12 pieces. You can trim the end pieces as they will be a little uneven, but they rise and bake just fine and I often just put the uneven side down when placing in the pan and press them down a bit., Place pieces evenly in dish 3 across and 4 down.

While the rolls are rising, prepare the caramel sauce., For the caramel: Pour the water in a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan (the caramel will bubble up quite a bit once it starts cooking, so it's important to have a pan that is deep and also has a heavy bottom to prevent burning). Sprinkle the sugar and salt on top. Very gently stir the ingredients together, just until the sugar is completely wet, being careful not to get the water or sugar on the sides of the pan. Cook over medium heat, shaking the pan occasionally to stir the sugar while it melts. When the sugar crystals have completely dissolved, increase the heat to medium-high. The sugar will begin to foam. Let it bubble and boil 3-5 minutes, keeping an eye on it so it doesn't boil over. Give the pan a swirl every once in a while to help the sugar turn color evenly. The sugar will begin to turn dark golden brown at this point, and you want to keep it bubbling until it just begins to smoke. Remove from the heat and add the butter, whisking carefully (remember, the sugar is crazy hot). Whisk in the heavy cream, followed by the vanilla. Set the caramel aside and let it come to room temperature., Adjust the oven rack to the middle lower position. Preheat the oven to 350F., Remove the plastic and bake 22 to 30 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through, until the rolls are golden brown., Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let the rolls cool for a few minutes. Use a kitchen towel or oven mitts to pick up each soufflé mold, then run a knife carefully around the edges of the pan, and flip the roll onto a wire rack set on top of a baking sheet. Carefully put the roll right side up, and repeat with the remaining rolls. Pour half the warm sauce evenly over the tops and sides of rolls and let them sit for 10-15 minutes. Stir the pecans into the remaining caramel sauce and pour over the top, covering the rolls evenly. Serve.","[('sweet dough', 1.0, None), ('brown sugar', 149.0, 'g'), ('ground cinnamon', 1.0, 'teaspoons'), ('grated nutmeg', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('ground cloves', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', None, None), ('unsalted butter', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('water', 0.25, 'cup'), ('granulated sugar', 248.0, 'g'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('unsalted butter', 1.0, 'stick'), ('heavy cream', 0.5, 'cup'), ('pure vanilla extract', 1.0, 'tablespoon')]"

Heat it up until it's a touch warmer than luke warm. You don't want it too hot or else your yeast will die. And you don't want it too cold or else your yeast will not grow., Sprinkle in your yeast and a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar will feed the yeast as it grows. Set your bowl aside for at least 5 minutes to make sure that your yeast has activated. After 5 minutes you should have a growing layer of yeast at the top of your bowl. If not, start over and try again. This step is crucial in having cinnamon rolls that rise., Once you have activated your yeast, you'll add in your sugar, softened butter, salt and eggs. Mix until it's fairly combined (it's okay if your butter isn't incorporated all the way)., Slowly mix in 6 cups of flour one at a time. The dough will appear sticky. Your seventh cup of flour will be the one you use to get rid of some of that stickiness. I usually add in a quarter of a cup at a time. The dough will be somewhat sticky to the touch, but not so sticky that you can't get it off your finger., Cover your dough with a clean dish towel and set aside. The longer you let your dough rise, the better it will be! I prefer letting it double in size in the bowl., Make the Maple Pecan Caramel, While your dough is rising, you can begin your Maple Pecan Caramel. This recipe makes enough Maple Pecan Caramel for one dozen cinnamon rolls (a 9x13 pan). I prefer to do one batch of pecan caramel rolls, then making the rest of my cinnamon rolls into butter cream (you can find that recipe in another post)., In a sauce pan, combine the brown sugar, maple syrup and butter. Stir well and bring to a gentle boil. Once it starts boiling, take the mixture off the heat., In the bottom of your pan, sprinkle a layer of pecans. Then pour the caramel mixture over the pecans. Set aside and start assembling your cinnamon rolls., Assembling the Cinnamon Rolls, Turn the risen dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and, using a rolling pin, roll into a rectangle., Spread 1/3 of your softened butter onto the dough rectangle (remember, you're making 3 dozen). You can add more or less butter. I typically add a bit more than the recommended amount of butter., Top evenly with 1/3 of your brown sugar, white sugar and cinnamon. Feel free to add more or less of each ingredient. I prefer adding a bit more cinnamon. There isn't a right or wrong way to add the cinnamon and sugars. Just make sure they're sprinkled somewhat evenly., Tightly roll up the dough to form a log. Cut 1-2 inch even rolls and place them on top of your pecan caramel topping., Cover with a clean towel and let them rise for another 30 minutes to an hour. The longer you let them rise, the fluffier they'll be!, Preheat your oven to 350°. Bake your cinnamon rolls for 25-30 minutes. You'll want to check the center cinnamon roll to make sure it's completely done. That center one tends to take a bit longer to bake., Once your cinnamon rolls are baked through, take them out of the oven. Now for the tricky part! You'll want to flip them over into another pan or onto a serving platter. Take care when doing this step because the caramel topping will be burning hot., Serving Suggestion, If you are planning on freezing your cinnamon rolls for later, you can bake them first. Let them cool completely and then cover with several layers of plastic wrap. When you're ready to eat them, pull them out of the freezer a few hours before serving to thaw.

Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/silicone spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula is a better choice.*, On medium speed, beat in the remaining sugar (which should be 1/2 cup/100g) and the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Add the eggs and salt and beat on medium speed until combined. The butter won’t really be mixing into the mixture, so don’t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. Switch the mixer down to low speed and with it running, add 1 cup of flour at a time, making sure it’s fully incorporated before adding the next. After 4 cups have been added, add the last 1/2 cup and beat until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 3 minutes. Dough will be soft., Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st Rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), Grease the bottom and sides of a metal or glass 9×13-inch baking dish or line with parchment paper., Roll out the dough, Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 12×18-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick.

You can make this dough without a stand mixer, you'll just have to knead by hand for 10 to 15 minutes., Add the softened butter in chunks and mix on low speed until it is broken up and distributed amongst the flour., Slowly drizzle in the warm milk while mixing on low and mix until the flour starts to stick together., Then add your eggs one at a time and mix until combined., Finally, add your salt. Salt is added last to give the yeast a chance to get a little coating in flour and butter. Salt kills yeast, so this gives the yeast an upper hand in the battle., Mix the dough on medium speed with the dough hook until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and bounces back when you touch it. Once it forms a smooth ball, turn off the mixer. This can take 5-10 minutes., Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and knead it for a few minutes on the counter., Roll the dough into a nice tight ball., Place the dough ball in a large bowl greased with oil and cover it with plastic wrap., Place the bowl in a warm place and let the dough rise until it doubles in size. This can take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes but will vary depending on the temperature of your room. 80°F is the best temperature for proofing, so I like to put it in my turned-off oven with the light on or on top of my dishwasher while it's running, Making the Caramel Pecan Glaze, Add the softened butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon to a large bowl and mix with a whisk or electric mixer until it's light and fluffy., Drizzle in the corn syrup and vanilla and mix until combined. Use less corn syrup if you want a thicker consistency for your glaze., Spread the glaze paste into a 9"" or 10"" round cake pan (or baking dish of your choice) around the sides and the bottom of the pan., Sprinkle pecans over the top of the glaze and set the pan aside. We're going to flip this upside down and it will become the gooey, caramelized top of the sticky buns., Assembling the Sticky Buns, Make the cinnamon sugar filling by adding the softened butter, sugar, and cinnamon to a large bowl and mixing until smooth with a whisk or hand mixer., When your dough has doubled in size, remove it from the bowl onto a lightly floured surface., Roll out the dough with a rolling pin into a large rectangle, 1/2 inch thick, about 12"" wide, and 15"" long., Smear the cinnamon-sugar mixture on top of the rolled-out dough, leaving about 1/2 inch of space along the outside edges of the dough., Sprinkle pecans on top of the dough, making sure to evenly space them out., Tightly roll from the long side of the dough into a log shape., Score 8 evenly-spaced sections in the top of the dough with a sharp knife, then carefully cut them into buns. The dental floss trick unfortunately won't work because it can't cut through the pecans, so a serrated knife works best., Assemble the cinnamon buns in your prepared pan on top of the glaze mixture. It's okay if they are almost touching, just make sure that your pan is big enough to easily fit all of the buns. They will proof again before baking., Cover the pan with a clean kitchen towel and place them in a warm area for 30 to 60 minutes until the buns are crowded in the pan and poofy. They don't have to be fully doubled in size, but your rise time will also be determined by the size of your pan., Baking the Sticky Buns, Bake at 350°F for 45-60 mins until the tops are golden brown and the internal temperature in the center reads 190°F. Use a thermometer to check, as the baking times will vary depending on what size pan you use., Make sure you place a sheet pan on the rack under the rolls to catch the drips, or it will burn on the bottom of your oven. I had to switch my sheet pans out a few times to avoid a lot of smoke from the burning sugar. This was a lot easier to clean a sheet pan than the bottom of my oven!, If the top is getting too brown and the center is not done, lightly cover it with a piece of foil to slow down the browning on top., Remove the finished sticky buns from the oven and cool in the pan for 5 minutes. We want the caramel glaze to set slightly, but still be hot so that it comes out of the pan., Place a large serving plate on top of your pan and carefully flip the sticky buns upside down., If there is any remaining caramel in the pan, put it back in the oven for 5 minutes then drizzle the caramel on top of the sticky buns.","[('milk', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('yeast', 4.0, 'grams'), ('flour', 12.5, 'ounces'), ('butter', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('sugar', 2.0, 'ounces'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('butter', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('sugar', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('cinnamon', 10.0, 'grams'), ('pecans', 2.0, 'ounces'), ('butter', 8.0, 'ounces'), ('sugar', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('sugar', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('cinnamon', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('corn syrup', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('pecans', 3.0, 'ounces')]"

Heat in the microwave for 30 sec – 45 sec, until warm to the touch but not hot. The butter will not melt completely., Pour into the dry ingredients with the egg and mix with a wooden spoon., Add in 2 more cups of flour and mix. It should turn pretty thick and sticky at this point., Add in 1/2 cup of flour and mix again. It should now turn shaggy and become difficult to stir. Once it reaches that point, set the spoon to the side and use your hands to mix and knead the dough., It will be sticky, so add another 1/4 cup of flour and continue to mix and knead by hand. It should turn into a smooth mass that’s soft and tacky., With a clean finger, press it into the dough. If your finger is sticking, add another 1/4 cup of flour and knead. If it’s not, then shape it into a ball and let it rest uncovered for 10 minutes., When the 10 minutes is up, the dough should have puffed up quite a bit but not quite doubled in size., Filling, Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and pat it into a rough rectangle shape. Roll it into a 14×16 inch rectangle using a rolling pin., Spread the room temperature butter into a thin and even layer, leaving about 1/4 inch border all around the outside of the dough., Sprinkle with the brown sugar and spread it even with your hand. Then top it with the cinnamon., Working from the 16 inch end of the dough, roll it up into a log. Place your hands at each end of the log and give it a gentle squeeze in to compact the log of dough. It may have stretched out a bit during the rolling process so this brings it back together., For best results, use unflavored dental floss to cut the rolls. If you don’t have floss, you could also use really thin sewing thread. If using a sharp knife, gently saw back and forth and try not to press straight down into the rolls. This will squish them into an odd shape., Using the floss, slide it under the roll and toss both ends of the floss over top. Pull them through to create a cut. Cut off the two ends of the log and then cut the remainder into 12 pieces., Cut the entire log in half, then cut those two halves in half to create 4 segments. Cut each of those 4 segments into 3 rolls to get a total of 12. Leave the rolls where they are while we make the pecan topping., Maple Pecan Topping, Combine the butter, maple syrup, and brown sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Melt down and stir until completely smooth., Remove from heat and mix in the salt and vanilla., To a 9×13 baking dish, pour the sticky syrup on top to cover then bottom of the pan. Then sprinkle with the chopped pecans., Place the rolls in the pan., Place in a warm spot and cover with a towel to rise for 1 hour. If you live in a colder climate, preheat the oven to the lowest temperature. Once it’s ready, turn the oven off and place the rolls inside. This creates a warm environment for the rolls to proof., Preheat the oven to 350F (first remove the rolls if you proofed them inside) and check on the rolls.

Microwave* on high for 1 minute, then remove and stir. Continue heating in 20 second intervals, pausing after each to stir, until the butter is melted and the milk is warm to the touch but not hot. (It should be around 110°F — I recommend measuring the temperature with a cooking thermometer.) If the mixture is too hot, just wait a few minutes for it to cool., Combine dry ingredients, In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, granulated sugar and salt until combined., Mix the dough, In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough-hook attachment (or see note below to mix the dough by hand), add the warm milk mixture and sprinkle the yeast on top, then give the mixture a brief stir. Add the flour mixture and egg, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add more flour (up to an additional 1/2 cup), until the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. (Use no more than 3 1/2 cups of flour total.) Continue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove dough and form it into a ball with your hands. Place it in a greased bowl and cover with a damp towel. Let the bowl rest for 10 minutes., Mix the cinnamon-sugar filling, While the dough rests, make your filling by whisking together the granulated sugar, brown sugar and ground cinnamon together in a small mixing bowl until combined., Roll out the dough, Once the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 12 x 18 inches in size. Use a knife or an offset spatula to spread 1/4 cup of softened butter out evenly over the entire surface of the dough. Then sprinkle the dough evenly* with the cinnamon and sugar filling, and gently press it into the dough., Wrap the giant cinnamon roll, Use a pizza cutter (or a knife) to slice the dough into six 2 x 18-inch strips. Gently roll up the first strip and place it in the center of a greased 9-inch cast-iron pan or pie plate.* Matching up the ends, add the second strip of dough and loosely wrap it around the first to create one large cinnamon roll. Repeat with the remaining strips, transferring the cinnamon roll to the pan once it gets too large to handle, and then finish wrapping the final strips in the pan. (See video for a demonstration. Also, don’t worry if some of the cinnamon sugar filling spills out.), Let the dough rise, Cover the dish with a damp towel, and leave it in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes. Heat the oven to 350°F., Make the icing, While the dough is rising, whisk together the cream cheese icing ingredients in a mixing bowl until smooth. If it seems too thick, add in an extra tablespoon of milk at a time until it reaches your desired consistency. If it is too thin, add in extra powdered sugar., Bake, Once the cinnamon roll has risen, uncover the dish. Place on the center rack of the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the cinnamon roll is golden and cooked through.

It will be messy, sticky, and loose – that is correct., First rise, Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let her rest at room temperature for 1-2 hours until the dough ball has puffed up and roughly doubled in size. I often turn on my oven to 200 degrees and place the dough bowl in close proximity to the fan to speed this process up., Store in the fridge, Once the dough has doubled in size, gently reach in with your hand and pull the sticky dough from the edges of the bowl. This should somewhat deflate the dough – that’s great. Put the bowl in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap. It needs at least 3 hours in the fridge so the dough has time to chill and become easier to handle. Don’t try to work with it right after the first rise – chilling is necessary to make it workable. The dough can stay in the fridge for up to 5 days., Assemble the rolls, Remove the dough from the fridge and coat the outside lightly with flour. Roll your dough ball out to about a 9×13 rectangle. This dough doesn’t like to be over-handled, and you don’t want to have to add a lot of extra flour – so work with it right out of the fridge., Filling, Brush the rectangle with the melted butter and sprinkle with the sugars and cinnamon. You can use your hands to press it in and make sure it’s all evenly coated., Roll, Roll the dough up starting at the short side. Try not to over-handle the dough as it will become sticky. Once the log is rolled up, use floss or a very sharp knife to trim the uneven ends, and then cut the log into 8 equal rolls. Place the rolls in a 9-10 inch round baking dish or pie plate (another size could also work, I just like how they fit in a round pan with 7 around the outside and one in the center)., Second rise:, Preheat the oven to 200 degrees and then turn it off. Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let the rolls rest in the turned-off oven for 45 minutes. They should fit a little more snugly together in the pan at this point. Cute! Take them out and turn the oven back on to 350 degrees. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-22 minutes., Prep the cream cheese frosting, Use an electric mixer to beat the cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy. Mix in the powdered sugar, vanilla, and a little bit of milk at a time until you get a smooth glaze; then continue to beat with the electric mixer until you have a light and fluffy frosting., Frost and enjoy, When they come out of the oven, give them a minute to cool. Then brush or spoon them with the frosting so it gets every crevice coated with gooey, drippy deliciousness. You can frost them again (second layer!) once they’ve cooled a bit more.

You may have to add extra flour after 8 cups – just add a little at a time if needed to get the right consistency so the dough can be handled. However, you may be fine with 8 cups. Dough should be firm but sticky. Cover with cloth and put in a warm place, and raise 1 ½ to 2 hours. Dough should nearly be doubled in size. Divide dough in half and empty onto floured surface and knead a little. Roll dough into rectangle, about ½ inch thick. (Do not roll it out too thin.) To this half of dough, spread on ½ square of softened butter, completely covering dough. Then sprinkle a coating of sugar over entire piece of dough. Then a layer of cinnamon. Be generous with the cinnamon; this is what makes it tasty. Roll into long roll, pinch edges together and slice with dental floss. Place on a cookie sheet covered with a silpat or parchment paper. Do same thing to second half of dough. Cover with a clean dishtowel (or saran wrap sprayed with cooking spray) and put in warm place, free of drafts, for 2 to 5 hours to raise–just depends-but the should be double in size.

Use whole milk if you have it. Warm the milk in the microwave in 20 second increments until it is nice and warm. Stir it with a small spoon and feel it with your finger. It should be about 105-110 degrees F, or about the temperature of nice bath water. If it feels at all HOT, stick it in the fridge until is cools down., Add 1 tablespoon of yeast and 5 tablespoons granulated sugar and stir. Wait 5 minutes and check to make sure your yeast is getting bubbly. If not, you have killed your yeast; dump it and start over. Better to start over now than after hours or rising!, Once you are certain that your yeast is alive and well, add two eggs to the measuring cup and whisk it all together until smooth., Meanwhile, add 3 and 1/4 cups flour to a large bowl or stand mixer. Make sure you spoon and level your flour. Add 1 teaspoon kosher salt., Add the wet ingredients to the flour in the bowl. Use the paddle attachment on your mixer (or regular beaters if you're using a hand mixer) and beat until combined, about 1 minute. Make sure to stop and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl., With the mixer running on low or medium low, add 1 tablespoon of very soft butter at a time, until the entire 1/2 cup has been added in. Make sure each tablespoon of butter is fully incorporated before adding more butter. The process of adding in the butter should take a couple minutes at least., Once all the butter is incorporated, beat on medium low speed for 5 minutes. The dough should be silky, smooth, and shiny. After 5 minutes, it will not have cleaned the sides of the bowl, but it should be formed together in a loose ball. It is VERY wet and not workable at all., Grease a large bowl with butter or oil. Don't be stingy now., Use a spatula to scrape the sweet dough into the greased bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or up to 2 days. (Chilling is not optional. You won't be able to work with this dough until it is completely chilled!), When you are ready to roll out the dough, prepare the pan and the filling., To prepare the pan: In a small bowl, microwave 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter until it is just barely melted. Add 1/4 cup cream and 5 tablespoons brown sugar. Stir together and scrape it into the pan you are using to bake your cinnamon rolls in., A note on what pan you use: I like to use an 11x17x1 inch half baking sheet. This will give you rolls that are not quite as tall but have a beautiful round shape. I prefer the ratio of cinnamon filling to dough when the rolls are baked. You can also use a 9x13 inch pan. This will give you taller rolls that will bake into each other in the oven. This recipe will work in either pan you use, but I recommend the 11x17 baking sheet., Use a spoon or pastry brush to spread the cream, butter, and brown sugar mixture all over the bottom of the pan you are using, and all the way up the sides as well., Prepare the filling for the rolls: Add 3/4 cup (1 and 1/2 sticks) very soft butter to a medium bowl. Add 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/2 or 3/4 teaspoon cardamom, if you are using it. (you should use it.) Stir it all together and set aside., Bring a pot of water to a boil on the stove. Place a 9x13 inch pan on a bottom rack in your oven. Place another rack above it. Turn your oven on to 350 for about 3 minutes, then turn it off. Your rolls are going to rise in the oven with a water bath., Roll out the dough: Prepare a work surface with a generous dusting of flour. I love to roll out dough on my pastry cloth, it makes it so easy., Scrape the chilled dough onto the flour and knead it together a couple times with your hands. Press it out into a rectangle with your hands, then use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a large rectangle. It should be about 1/4 inch thick if not a little thicker. It should measure about 12 inches by 16-18 inches. It doesn't have to be exact., Use a spatula to spread the filling on top of the dough, all the way to the edges. If the filling looks like it's not soft enough to spread easily, put it in the microwave for 5 seconds and stir. You want the filling to go into the oven thick, not melted, so don't put it in the microwave for too long., Roll up the dough, starting from the long edge. As you roll, use your hands to smooth out the dough from the center to make the roll even (so that the center of your roll is not way thicker than the edge of your roll.), Use your fingers to seal the roll., Use a very long and sharp serrated knife to cut the dough into 1 or 1 and 1/2 inch rolls. Use a sawing motion. Dip your knife in flour in between cuts. The dough is pretty sticky on the inside., Place each roll in the prepared pan. They should not touch each other., Once all the rolls are on the pan, generously spray some plastic wrap with nonstick spray, and cover the rolls. Do NOT forget to spray the plastic wrap. Do NOT use a tea towel. The dough is pretty sticky, and if your cover sticks to them, it will ruin your beautiful rise when you try to take it off. No, I'm not at all bitter that this happened to me on one of my test runs, why do you ask??, Pour the boiling water that you have on the stove into the 9x13 inch pan that's on the lower rack in your oven. Make sure that you remembered to turn off the oven. It should be nice and warm but NOT HOT. You want the rolls to rise, not cook. If you accidentally left your oven on too long, leave the door open and let it cool down. If the racks are too hot to touch with your fingers, don't put the rolls in the oven. Let them start rising on top of the oven and put the rolls in when the oven has cooled a bit., Let the covered rolls rise for about 45 minutes. They should be nice and puffy., About 15 minutes before the rolls are finished rising, remove the rolls and the pan of water from the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F., Once the rolls are quite puffy and have just about doubled in size, bake at 350 for about 15-18 minutes., The rolls should be golden on top when fully baked. The best way to know if the rolls are done in the middle is to use a thermometer: the center of the rolls should be 190 degrees F. The bottom of the rolls should also be lightly browned, but lifting the edge of a roll can be tricky., Make the cream cheese frosting while the rolls are in the oven. In a large bowl or stand mixer, beat 8 ounces softened cream cheese with 1/2 cup softened butter. Scrape the sides and bottom and beat for a couple minutes until it's nice and fluffy. Add 1 cup powdered sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt, and beat well., Let the rolls cool for about 10 minutes, then spread with HALF the cream cheese frosting. If you are serving these to a large group and they will all be eaten right away, frost with the entire amount. Otherwise, save the other half of the frosting to serve with leftover rolls, or to pass at the table for guests to serve themselves. I find that people have such different opinions on the level of frosting they enjoy, that it's better to let guests serve themselves., Overnight Instructions:, Make the recipe as written through step 23 (except don't boil the water). Once the rolls are shaped and on the pan, cover as directed, then refrigerate overnight. In the morning, prepare the oven by preheating the oven (and then turning it off) and placing a pan of boiling water on a bottom rack. (Remember to turn the oven off, as described in step 24.) Let the rolls rise for the same amount of time and bake as directed.","[('whole milk', 1.0, 'cup'), ('active dry yeast', 1.0, 'tablespoons'), ('granulated sugar', 5.0, 'tablespoons'), ('large eggs', 2.0, None), ('all purpose flour', 3.0, 'cups'), ('kosher salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('butter', 0.5, 'cup'), ('butter', 0.25, 'cup'), ('cream', 0.25, 'cup'), ('brown sugar', 5.0, 'tablespoons'), ('butter', 0.75, 'cup'), ('brown sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('cinnamon', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('kosher salt', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('cardamom', 0.75, 'teaspoon'), ('cream cheese', 1.0, 'package'), ('butter', 0.5, 'cup'), ('powdered sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('kosher salt', 0.25, 'teaspoon')]"

Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/silicone spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula is a better choice.*, On medium speed, beat in the remaining sugar (which should be 1/2 cup/100g) and the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Add the eggs and salt and beat on medium speed until combined. The butter won’t really be mixing into the mixture, so don’t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. Switch the mixer down to low speed and with it running, add 1 cup of flour at a time, making sure it’s fully incorporated before adding the next. After 4 cups have been added, add the last 1/2 cup and beat until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 3 minutes. Dough will be soft., Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st Rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), Grease the bottom and sides of a 9×13 baking dish or line with parchment paper., Roll out the dough, Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 12×18-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll it out, stop what you’re doing, cover it lightly, and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When you return to the dough, it should stretch out much easier., For the filling, Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and maple syrup together on medium-high speed until combined and creamy.

Mix until well combined., Add yeast and the rest of the flour. I like to add the flour slowly, 1/2 cup at a time and watch how the dough reacts. You don’t want to add too much flour. Add just enough to where a soft dough forms and the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl., Knead dough until smooth and elastic. This takes about 6-8 minutes with a mixer and 10 minutes if you are kneading by hand. Do the window pane test to ensure the kneading has been done properly, First rise. Move the dough to a large bowl and place somewhere warm. I like to use my barely warmed oven(preheat for a few minutes and then turn it off). Allow the dough to rise until double in size – in a warm spot that takes 30-45 minutes.

Add the yeast to the milk and using a spoon, gently mix the yeast into the milk, making sure all of the yeast is wet. Set aside, Add the sugar, melted butter and salt to the large bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Mix to combine. Add the yeast/milk mixture and mix on medium-low speed just to combine. Add the eggs and mix on medium speed until eggs are incorporated. Replace the paddle attachment with the dough hook attachment. Note: It’s hard to incorporate the eggs with the dough attachment. That’s why I use both the paddle and the dough hook attachments in this recipe., Add the flour and turn mixer on low until the flour is all moist. Turn mixer to medium and mix until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl, yet sticks to the bottom. This will take about four minutes. The dough should be very elastic if you pull it with your fingers but not sticky., Transfer the dough to a well-greased bowl, turning dough over once. Cover with a towel and place in an oven tht has been preheated to 165 degrees and turned off. Leave the door ajar. You can also opt to cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a towel and place in a warm area in your kitchen, but make sure it’s free of any drafts. Allow dough to rise until it’s almost doubled in size. This can take anywhere from 1 1/2 to 2 hours, depending on how warm the environment is., Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle., Liberally butter the sides and bottom of a 9-by13-inch baking dish., Mix the brown sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl., Brush the dough with the softened butter, stopping 1/2 inch from the edges. Sprinkle the brown sugar and cinnamon evenly over the buttered part of the dough., Starting with the edge of the long side nearest you, gently roll the dough up as tightly as possible. When finished rolling, brush some softened butter along the very edge of the unrolled edge of dough. This will be your glue for seaming the dough together. Using your fingertips, go along the seam, pinching it together with your fingers.to seal the dough. Roll the cylinder of dough over, so the seam is on the underneath side. Using your hands, firm up the dough, making it even in width from one end to the other. Using a serrated knife cut the dough into 10 even rolls, about 1 3/4 inches each in thickness. You can also use dental floss to cut the rolls., Arrange rolls in buttered baking dish, cut side up. Bake the same day or hold until the next day for baking., Bake the rolls until they are golden brown on top, about 25 minutes. Allow rolls to cool slightly while making the icing. Rolls should be warm but not hot when spreading the icing on them., Add the cream cheese to a mixing bowl and mix on medium-high speed with an electric mixer until it’s smooth and free of any lumps. Add the butter, salt, and vanilla and mix on medium speed until combined. Add the powdered sugar gradually on low speed until incorporated. Add the half & half and mix on medium speed until semi-thin and creamy. At this point, make the icing the consistency that you prefer. I don’t prefer a really thick icing. I like one that is a medium consistency and will slightly melt and run into the crevices on the warm rolls., Spread the icing over the tops of the warm rolls and enjoy them while they’re warm!, Cover the leftover rolls securely and store at room temperature for up to one day.","[('milk', 1.0, 'cup'), ('yeast', 0.25, 'ounce'), ('sugar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('butter', 6.0, 'tablespoons'), ('salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('eggs', 2.0, None), ('flour', 4.25, 'cups'), ('oil', None, None), ('butter', None, None), ('butter', 6.0, 'tablespoons'), ('sugar', 0.75, 'cup'), ('cinnamon', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('cream cheese', 2.0, 'ounces'), ('butter', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('salt', None, None), ('vanilla extract', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('powdered sugar', 2.0, 'cups'), ('milk', 2.0, 'tablespoons')]"

Let sit for 3-5 minutes to make sure the yeast is activated. You will be able to tell if it's bubbling. If using instant yeast, you can skip this step and add the yeast directly to the mix with the flour and salt., Next, add the sweet potato purée, sugar, melted vegan butter, and vanilla to the large mixing bowl and whisk together to combine., Once mixed, gradually begin adding in your flour about ½-1 cup at a time. Also, add in the 1 tsp of salt at this time., Once all the flour has been added in, knead the dough. If using a standing mixer, switch the attachment to the bread hook and knead for 5-10 minutes until elastic. If you are kneading by hand, knead on a lightly floured surface for 10-15 minutes or until the dough is elastic and significantly less sticky. (Since the dough has sweet potato in it, it will be stickier than normal bun dough, but should firm up a lot during kneading). The dough is done being kneaded once it can be stretched without easily tearing, is smooth, and tacky but not sticky., Once the bread is ready, add it to a well oiled bowl for the first rise. I prefer to coat my bowl in olive oil, but any oil works here. The dough will be sticky so you may want to lightly oil your hands before grabbing the dough., Then, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a towel, place in a warm place, and let rise 1 hour or until doubled in size. I like to test my dough by ""poking"" it with a finger. If it doesn't bounce back and stays indented, it is ready. It is also important to not “overproof” the dough as it can turn sour from the yeast turning the sugar into alcohol, so do not let the dough sit too long., Adding the Filling:, In a separate bowl, mash together the brown sugar, softened room temperature vegan butter, and cinnamon until a thick paste forms. This can also be done in a blender, food processor, or by hand with a fork. Then, set aside and turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface., Roll the dough into a 1"" thick rectangle that is around 9*14 inches in width and length. You don't want the dough to be too thin or you will have a hard time rolling it up once the filling is inside!, After the dough is rolled out, use a spatula to spread the cinnamon sugar filling evenly across the dough. Make sure to leave a 1/4 inch border around the edges of the dough without filling. Then, sprinkle the chopped pecans on top of the cinnamon sugar filling., Beginning with the longer side of the rectangle, tightly roll up the dough into a log. Lightly flour the dough as you go to help if it gets a bit sticky. Make sure to seal the roll by pinching the edges together. Then, flip the dough over so the pinched seal is facing down., Once the dough is rolled into a log, trim the ends and discard. Cut the remaining dough into 10 evenly sized rolls using a very sharp knife. Place the rolls into a large ceramic pan (I used a 14.5” oval pan), cover with plastic wrap or a towel, and let rest for another 30 minutes at room temperature while you preheat the oven. (You can also let the dough rise overnight covered in the fridge for 6-8 hours and bake in the morning)., Baking The Rolls:, Preheat the oven to 350F., Once the oven is preheated, remove the plastic wrap or towel from the pan of rolls and add the pan to the oven. Bake the rolls for 30-35 minutes or until cooked through. Then, remove the rolls from the oven and let cool slightly. While the rolls are cooling, make the maple spice glaze!, Making the Maple Spice Glaze:, Add maple syrup, almond milk, and cinnamon to a small bowl and whisk together. Then, gradually add in the powdered sugar until a thick glaze forms. If needed, add in a little more milk for a thinner glaze or more powdered sugar for a thicker glaze. Overall, the glaze should be very thick., Pour the glaze over the warm sweet potato rolls and serve immediately.

Increase the speed to medium and continue kneading the dough until smooth, elastic, and supple, about 5-6 minutes. Alternatively, if you are not using a stand mixer, knead the dough by hand for 10 minutes on a lightly floured surface., Shape the dough into a ball and place it into a lightly greased large bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. For same-day rolls: let the dough rise/proof in a warm environment until it doubles in size, about 1 1/2 hours or longer depending on the temperature of your environment.

After the first proof, punch down the dough knocking out the air and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.

Sprinkle the brown sugar on top of the butter and use your hands to rub it in, leaving a slight margin around the edges. Lastly, evenly sprinkle the cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt over the top and use your hand to gently pat it into the mixture., Roll up the dough into a tight log starting from the longest side with the seam side down. Pinch the seam to seal in the edges as much as you can. I like to cut off a bit of the ends of the dough because they are not as full in size as the other sections.

Add the rolls into the baking pan, in 3 rows of 4, leaving a bit of space between each one for expansion. Cover the pan with plastic wrap/clean kitchen towel. Let the rolls proof in a warm environment until puffy, about 1 – 1 1/2 hours or longer depending on the temperature of your environment (and if the 1st proof was in the fridge). Towards the end of proofing time, preheat the oven to 350°F., Baking the rolls: Remove the plastic wrap/kitchen towel. Bake the sweet potato cinnamon rolls until lightly golden brown, about 30 minutes. While the rolls bake, prepare the icing., To make the maple icing, In the bowl of a stand mixer or using a handheld electric mixer, beat the cream cheese and butter together until smooth.

Next,pour the yeast mixture in your mixing bowl and add half the flour. Mix on low with a paddle attachment. Add 1 egg. Switch to the dough hook. Add remaining flour mixture and the second egg. Dough should look dry. Once second egg is combined, start adding bits of the butter a little at a time until thoroughly combined. Continue to knead with dough hook for 3 minutes then remove from mixer and place in a large greased bowl.Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and place somewhere warm with no drafts or breezes. Let this proof for 1-1 ½ hours. The dough is heavy but will rise to about double in size., Line a sheet tray with parchment and pecans.To make the pecan praline, heat ¼ cup of sugar in a large skillet in an even layer (not non-stick).Do not stir. Once the sugar begins to caramelize, sprinkle over the remaining ¼ cup sugar and swirl the pan until its evenly caramelized. Immediately pour caramel over pecans and let the caramel harden for 15 minutes. Break up pecan sugar mixture and place into a food processor. Process until very crumbly, and add in salt and cinnamon. The mixture should be nutty and crumbly, set aside until needed., Next, sprinkle some flour on your work surface and roll out the proofed dough to about 10”x18”. Spread the pecan filling over, leaving 1/2”from the sides clean. Next, starting from the bottom, roll as tightly as you can until it is all rolled up.The ABSOLUTE best way to cut pieces of dough is to use a flavorless piece of dental floss and tighten around the rolled dough.

(Based on the type of yeast used, milk temperatures will vary. Red Star Platinum yeast calls for warmer temperatures than most, 120 to 130F; other brands and yeast call for much lower temperatures, about 95 to 105F. Heat the mixture according to manufacturer’s recommendations on the packaging. Taking the temperature with a digital thermometer is highly recommended, but if you’re not, make sure the milk is warm, not hot. Err on the cooler rather than hotter side so you don’t kill the yeast.) If the milk separates or gets a little funny looking after being warmed, whisk it to smooth it out., Add butter-buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients in mixing bowl., In a small bowl, crack and lightly whisk the eggs, and then add eggs to mixing bowl., Turn mixer on low speed and allow it to knead dough for about 5 to 7 minutes (about 7 to 10 minutes by hand using a wooden spoon and then switching to your hands). 3 cups of flour and 5 minutes is perfect for me, but if after 5 minutes your dough is very sloppy, wet, and won’t come together, add up to 1/4 cup flour, or as needed until it does come together. However, the more flour added, the denser and heavier the rolls will be; wetter dough is preferred to overly dry. If dough is dry or crumbly, drizzle in buttermilk until it comes together., Remove dough from the mixing bowl, spray a large bowl with cooking spray, place the dough in the bowl, and flip it over once so it’s lightly oiled on both top and bottom., Cover bowl with plasticwrap and place it in a warm, draft-free place to rise for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or doubled in size. I keep my bowl inside a powered-off oven that I preheated for 1 minute to 400F, then it’s powered off. Do not, repeat do not, keep the oven on. The pre-heated, warm oven creates a nice 85F-ish environment, ideal for yeast. If your rising spot is cold, rising will likely take longer than 2 1/2 hours., While dough rises, line a 9×13-inch pan with aluminum foil, spray with cooking spray; set aside., Roll Out the Dough & Fill, After dough has doubled in size, punch it down. Turn dough out onto a Silpat or floured countertop., With a rolling pin, roll it out to about 26-by-13-inches. Use the 13-inch side of the 9-x13 pan to eyeball it, no need use a ruler., Using a knife, evenly spread butter over dough, leaving a 1/2-inch bare margin., Add about 3/4 cup marmalade, more as needed, and smooth it with a knife. It should be a thin-ish layer; too much and you risk it leaking, but not enough and the rolls aren’t orangey enough; use your judgment. The butter and marmalade get smeared together, which is okay., Evenly sprinkle the brown sugar over the top, and lightly pat it down with your fingertips to help it adhere., Slice the Dough, Starting with a long edge (the 26-inch side), roll the dough into a tightly wound log, with the seam side down., Using a knife, make small hash marks so there will be 20 evenly sized rolls (about 1 to 1 1/2 inches wide; or make bigger rolls and yield 12 to 16). Hash marks create less guesswork once you start slicing and things get messier and harder to eyeball where to slice; the hash marks are nice place-markers., Use plain, unwaxed dental floss to slice the rolls. I highly recommend slicing the rolls with floss, not knives. Floss does not squish or compact the log like knives do., Arrange the rolls in the prepared pan, 5 rows of 4 rolls across. Cover with plastic wrap., Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until the rolls have nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Rolls are best warm and fresh, but will keep airtight at room temp for up to 4 days; reheat in micro for about 5 seconds to re-soften or as desired.

Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a 22 x 15-inch (55 x 38-cm) rectangle. Carefully and evenly spread the filling mixture across the entire surface of the dough. Then (as pictured above) fold the left third of the dough in towards the center, and fold the right third of the dough over that towards the center, like you’re folding a business letter. Gently run the rolling pin over the dough to press out any big bubbles. Then roll the dough out a bit more so that it forms a 15 x 8-inch (38 x 20-cm) rectangle., Form the buns., Using a pizza cutter, pastry cutter or a knife, slice the dough into even 2 x 20-cm long strips. Take one strip and twist it several times, gently stretching it as you do so until it nearly doubles in length. Grab one end of the twisted strip and loosely wrap the dough around two fingers twice, like a bandage.

Set aside., In a separate large bowl, stir the egg(s), salt, sugar, and oil together until well blended., Make sure your water is hot, around 120 degrees. If you don't have a culinary thermometer, this temperature should feel uncomfortable to the touch but not painful). Pour the hot water on top of the egg mixture, but don't stir it together yet. (We want to allow our flour and instant yeast to activate when being mixed with the hot water)., Immediately add the flour mixture on top of the hot water, and use a sturdy spatula to stir all of the ingredients together until a dough is formed and the ingredients are well blended. The dough will get firmer, stickier, and more difficult to stir as it thickens., There's no kneading of this dough, as we don't want to incorporate any additional flour, but we want to stir it until it gets stretchy. Leave the dough in the bowl, and continue to scrape the sides and stir the dough with your heavy-duty spatula for around 2-3 minutes, or until the dough is stretchy and uniform. It will be a very sticky dough., Allow the dough to rise at room temperature until double in size, around one hour., Loosely wrap the bowl in plastic wrap, and place the risen dough in the fridge overnight, for at least 4 hours but no more than 24 hours., Day One: Prepare Filling Ingredients, Stir together the brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your fingers to break apart any large brown sugar pieces, and to make sure the cinnamon is thoroughly mixed in. Wrap this mixture or place it in an air-tight container until Day Two., Whisk the Instant Clearjel and Flour together until well blended. Wrap or place in an air-tight container until Day Two., If you'd like, you may take your salted butter out of the fridge so that it is softened and ready to roll in the morning., Day Two: Prepare Pan, The 1 oz of melted butter for brushing will be used three times. First, brush the foil pan(s) generously with melted butter on the bottom, sides, and inner corners. A 1x batch makes 6 large cinnamon rolls that fit in one foil half-size steam pan. A 2x batch makes 12 large cinnamon rolls that fit in two foil half-size steam pans., Day Two: Roll Out Cinnamon Rolls, Generously dust your counter with about 1/4 cup of flour., Scrape the risen refrigerated cinnamon roll dough on top of the dusted flour. Use your fingers to scrape out any stuck to the bowl and add it to the dough. The dough will be sticky. Avoid pressing the dough into itself or turning it into a ball--this will overwork the dough. We want to roll it out with very little shaping of the dough. Instead, just lightly dust any sticky portions of the dough, and press any sticky edges into the floured counter. Lightly press the dough into a rectangular shape before rolling (I recommend watching this recipe video)., Roll out the dough into an 9-inch horizontal by 16-inch vertical rectangle. (A 1x batch will be tall and skinny. A 2x batch will be wider than it is tall as seen in the recipe video). Using extra flour only as needed, dust any parts of the dough with flour that sticks to the table or rolling pin., If your butter is firm, microwave it for a few seconds until softened but not melted. Mix your softened butter thoroughly with the prepared Instant Clearjel mixture. Immediately spread it onto the rolled-out dough. We mix this right before spreading so that it doesn't have time to thicken before spreading. Spread it evenly all the way to the very edge of the dough., Pour the prepared Brown Sugar/Cinnamon mixture on top of the butter and spread it evenly all the way to the very edge of the dough., Roll up the cinnamon dough tightly, curving the edges in slightly as you roll (watch the recipe video). This helps maintain a nice roll on the edges and prevents the cinnamon mixture from escaping. When you are left with one inch of dough, pull it up and pinch it tightly against the rolled dough, creating a pinched seam., Dust the seam with flour, and turn your dough so it is seam side down against the floured counter. Shape the roll of dough with your hands if needed so that it is even in thickness. Score the dough with a bench scraper, pastry divider, or knife into 6 rolls, then cut the rolls with a bench scraper or sharp knife., Place the cinnamon rolls into your prepared pan, with little room between each roll and 1/2 inch from the edge of the pan. Lightly press down on each roll so that the edges of each roll barely touch each other, and improve their round form if needed. (The cinnamon rolls will rise into whatever shape they are in now. So if you have some oval or misshapen rolls, use your hands to form the edges into a circle before they rise.), Brush the cinnamon rolls with melted salted butter, then allow to rise at room temperature until double in size, around one hour., Bake the Cinnamon Rolls, Preheat oven to 350 degrees., Bake the risen cinnamon rolls in the preheated 350-degree oven on the middle or top rack for 12 minutes, then turn the oven down to 325 degrees. Bake for an additional 6-8 minutes or until the dough bounces back when you tap it lightly with your finger. Check several areas of the rolls for doneness. The inside of the cinnamon rolls should be fully baked, but the top of the cinnamon rolls should still be light or just lightly golden. (If you are baking in a cake pan instead of a foil pan, keep in mind that glass pans and dark pans will take less time in the oven)., Brush the cinnamon rolls one last time with melted butter., Freeze the Take and Bake Cinnamon Rolls, When the cinnamon rolls have cooled slightly (they can still be warm), cover the pan with the foil lid (or make your own covering out of heavy duty foil). Wrap the lidded pan thoroughly with plastic wrap, and freeze up to 3 months., Make the Cinnamon Roll Glaze, You can either make the glaze right while the cinnamon rolls bake, or make it ahead and freeze it with the rolls. Whisk the powdered sugar and water together until smooth. When making it ahead of time, pour the prepared glaze in an 8 ounce microwave-safe container and freeze until the day before serving., Bake and Serve the Take and Bakes, Thaw the prepared glaze in the fridge the night before serving. Unwrap the cinnamon rolls (leave the foil lid on), and bake in a 325 degree oven for 40-50 minutes or until heated through., Meanwhile, heat the glaze in the microwave at 50% power, stirring regularly, until it reaches a drizzling consistency. Drizzle the glaze over the warm cinnamon rolls and serve.","[('all-purpose flour', 400.0, 'grams'), ('instant clearjel', 1.0, 'teaspoons'), ('instant yeast', 1.0, 'tablespoons'), ('egg(s)', 1.0, None), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('sugar', 3.0, 'tablespoons'), ('vegetable oil', 3.0, 'tablespoons'), ('hot water', 1.0, 'cups'), ('light brown sugar', 227.0, 'grams'), ('cinnamon', 1.0, 'tablespoons'), ('instant clearjel', 1.0, 'teaspoons'), ('all-purpose flour', 1.0, 'teaspoons'), ('salted butter', 2.0, 'ounces'), ('powdered sugar', 141.0, 'grams'), ('water', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('salted butter', 1.0, 'ounces'), ('flour', 0.25, 'cup')]"

Combine the flour, dry milk, potato flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and lesser amount of water then mix and knead everything together—by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle—to form a smooth, elastic dough, adding more water if necessary. If you're kneading in a stand mixer, it should take 7 to 10 minutes at second speed, and the dough should barely clean the sides of the bowl, perhaps sticking a bit at the bottom. In a bread machine (or by hand), it should form a smooth ball., Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover the bowl, and allow the dough to rise, at room temperature, until it's nearly doubled in bulk, about 1 to 2 hours. Rising may take longer, especially if you've kneaded by hand or if your kitchen is cool.

Increase the mixer to medium speed and knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes (knead for 15-18 minutes by hand). If after 5 minutes of kneading, the dough is still overly sticky, add a tablespoon or two of flour at a time until the dough clears the sides of the bowl but has a slight tacky feel when pressed between your fingertips. (See this tutorial for a visual.), Place the dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl and cover the top tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled, around 2 to 2 ½ hours, depending on the warmth of your kitchen., Meanwhile, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon and orange zest in a small bowl until well mixed and set aside. Spray 2 round 8-inch baking pans with cooking spray and set aside., When the dough has risen, gently punch down and roll into a 16X12-inch rectangle. Spread evenly with the softened butter. Top with the cinnamon sugar mixture, evenly pressing the cinnamon/sugar gently into the butter. Starting with one of the long edges, roll the dough tightly into classic cinnamon roll form, pinching the edge to seal., Using a serrated knife (see pictures below for a visual), slice the dough in half lengthwise. Gently take one length of dough and coil it around in one of the prepared baking pans. The layers will want to fall apart a bit, but don't stress too much, when it bakes to perfection, you won't notice if it was a little messy going into the pan. I put my baking pan very close to the length of dough and gently lift about four or five inches of the dough into the pan and then coil the rest around itself. Repeat with remaining length of dough (placing it inside the other prepared pan)., Lightly cover the cinnamon rolls with greased plastic wrap and let them rise until doubled. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and bake the rolls for 18-22 minutes, until lightly golden on top and cooked through. While the rolls are baking, whisk together the glaze ingredients until smooth. Remove the cinnamon rolls from the oven and using a spatula, nudge them out of the pan onto a cooling rack set over waxed or parchment paper or onto a serving plate. Drizzle the glaze over the cinnamon rolls. Slice the cinnamon rolls into pie-shaped wedges and serve warm.","[('buttermilk', 0.75, 'cup'), ('butter', 6.0, 'tablespoons'), ('eggs', 3.0, None), ('flour', 4.25, 'cups'), ('granulated sugar', 0.25, 'cup'), ('instant yeast', 2.25, 'teaspoons'), ('salt', 1.25, 'teaspoons'), ('butter', 0.5, 'cup'), ('brown sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('cinnamon', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('orange', 1.0, None), ('powdered sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('orange zest', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('orange juice', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('milk', 1.0, 'tablespoon')]"

Remove immediately from heat after scalding., Meanwhile, combine 1/3 cup butter, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Pour scalded milk over the top and cool to 110 degrees to 115 degrees, stirring occasionally. Whisk in the eggs., While the scalded milk mixture is cooling, add the yeast to the warm water (110 degrees) and let it ""bloom"" for 5 minutes., In an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine 4 1/2 cups flour, yeast, and water. With the motor running on low, slowly drizzle in the scalded milk mixture., Increase the mixer speed to medium and mix until shiny and smooth, 6 to 10 minutes. If the dough is sticky after 3 minutes, add the remaining ½ cup flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together.

Place in a greased bowl and brush with 1 teaspoon melted butter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let proof (rise) in a warm place (80 degrees to 85 degrees) until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours., To make the filling:, While the dough is rising, mix the filling.

Heat on high for 1 minute, then remove and stir to help melt and dissolve the butter. Continue heating in 20 second intervals, pausing after each to stir, until the butter is melted and the milk is warm but not hot to the touch. (I recommend measuring the temperature with a cooking thermometer. It should be around 110°F.) If the mixture is too hot, it can kill the yeast, so just wait a few minutes until it reaches the correct temperature., Combine dry ingredients., In a separate bowl, whisk together 3 cups of the flour (not all of the flour), granulated sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and salt until combined., Mix the dough., In the bowl of a stand mixer* fitted with the dough-hook attachment, add the warm milk mixture and sprinkle the yeast on top, then give the mixture a brief stir.

(The dough will still be moist and slightly sticky though.) Continue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove dough and form it into a ball with your hands. Place the dough ball in a greased bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let it rest for 10 minutes., Mix the cinnamon-sugar filling., While the dough rests, make your filling by whisking together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice together in a small mixing bowl until combined., Roll out the dough., Once the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 10 x 15 inches in size. (If you want all of the edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into an even rectangle.) Use a knife or an offset spatula to spread 1/4 cup of softened butter (for the cinnamon filling) out evenly over the entire surface of the dough. Sprinkle the dough evenly with the cinnamon and sugar mixture, and gently pat it down into the butter., Roll up the dough, Beginning at the 15-inch edge, tightly roll up the dough and give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss* or a knife to slice off the two ends of the roll (just 1/2-inch or so on each end, since the ends typically don’t have as much cinnamon and sugar filling, which you can discard) so that the ends are even. Cut the remaining dough into 12 equal rounds., Let the dough rise., Place each of the cut cinnamon rolls into a greased 9 x 13-inch baking dish.

Set aside., Place warm water in a large bowl. Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water. Whisk with a fork, wooden spoon, or spatula and allow to rest and activate for 10 minutes., Once the yeast mixture is active and bubbly, add the milk, sugar, salt, vanilla extract, and eggs. Whisk to combine., Gradually stir in flour. If using a stand mixer, use your dough hook. If mixing by hand, continue to use a wooden spoon. Add 1 cup of flour, allow dough to come together, then add the softened butter and continue to blend. When butter is mostly incorporated, add the remaining 1 and ¼ cups of flour and blend until dough has mostly come together. It may still be shaggy, but it should pull away from the sides of the bowl fairly easily., Turn out dough on a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes, adding flour about 1 Tablespoon at a time if the dough is too sticky, until smooth and elastic. Your dough should resemble the surface texture of PlayDoh when it is done. Allow the dough to rest for 10 minutes while you prepare the filling., FILLING, In a medium size bowl, combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Whisk or stir until well-blended. Set aside., Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into two rectangles approximately 7"" x 12"" in size. Dough will be very elastic, so be patient and keep rolling. There is no need to rush this step., When you have your rectangles, brush the melted butter evenly over each rectangle of dough, leaving about ½"" border around the edges. Sprinkle half of the cinnamon-sugar evenly over the melted butter on each rectangle., ASSEMBLE AND BAKE THE DOUGH, Working with one rectangle at a time and starting with one of the long sides, roll the dough up into a tight 12"" log. Use your fingers or palms on either end of the log to gently squeeze the log to ""contain"" the uneven ends. Using a sharp serrated knife and taking care to keep the seam side down, cut the log into 12 even slices. Don't worry if filling spills out. Repeat with the second rectangle., Place the slices cut side down in the prepared pan, gather any cinnamon-sugar that fell out, sprinkle over the rolls, then press down gently to flatten slightly. Cover loosely with foil or a kitchen towel. Allow rolls to rise for 30 minutes., When cinnamon roll dough has risen, preheat the oven to 350ºF (177ºC). Bake the rolls for 18-22 minutes or until rolls just start to brown on top. You can cover the rolls with foil to prevent browning, if desired. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes while you prepare the cream cheese frosting., CREAM CHEESE FROSTING, In a large bowl with a handheld mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and cream cheese on medium-high speed until smooth., Turn the mixer speed down to low and add the powdered sugar. Add the vanilla and salt and continue mixing until smooth., Spread cream cheese frosting onto slightly cooled rolls. I find that dropping mounds of frosting onto the rolls using this #110 cookie scoop (which is 1 teaspoon in size) and then spreading the frosting with a spatula or the back of a spoon works best.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the warm milk, yeast, and sugar. Let the mixture stand until foamy, about five minutes. Add the eggs, flour, and salt to the bowl and mix on medium speed until a sticky dough is formed. Beat in the butter, 2 tablespoons at a time, waiting until the butter is incorporated before adding the next batch. The butter needs to be very soft for this to work; if the butter isn't incorporating, knead each piece in your fingers until soft before adding it to the dough. Once all the butter is incorporated, knead the dough for 10 minutes on medium speed (or knead by hand)., Rise overnight: Shape the dough into a ball, place in a large, lightly oiled bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in the refrigerator overnight, at least 8 hours. It will slowly double in size., Cut and shape the rolls: In the morning, remove the dough from the refrigerator. The dough will be quite stiff and firm, but should roll easily. Dust your work surface and a rolling pin lightly with flour, and roll the dough out into a rectangle approximately 12x16 inches in size. Spread the dough with butter, leaving a 1-inch border on one of the shorter edges. Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Sprinkle the mixture over the butter in an even layer. Starting from the short edge (the one with butter all the way to the edge), roll the dough into a tight spiral. Pinch the spiral closed (the unbuttered edge should stick to the log of dough). Trim the ends if they are shaggy. Cut the roll in half crosswise to make 2 pieces. Cut each piece in half again to make 4, and each piece again to make a total of 8 rolls. Place the rolls in a greased 9x13-inch baking dish., Cover the rolls with plastic wrap, and let them rise in a warm place for 30 to 90 minutes: Rising time will depend on the temperature in your kitchen. When ready, the rolls should be puffed and pillowy. They should be touching each other with very little space between each roll., When the rolls look half-risen, preheat the oven to 350°F., Bake the rolls: Bake the rolls for 20 to 25 minutes until they are golden on top and puffy. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack for 5 minutes before frosting., Make the frosting: While the rolls bake, use a hand mixer or stand mixer to beat the cream cheese and butter together until creamy. Add half of the powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon of milk. Beat for 1 minute. Add the remaining sugar and vanilla, and beat for 1 additional minute. Add additional milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the frosting is as spreadable as you like., Serve warm: Frost the cinnamon rolls generously while they're still a bit warm.

You may need to add a little less or a little more depending on your conditions (altitude, moisture, etc.).

This will probably take only a minute or so. Remove from the heat, and set it aside for several minutes.,   ,         , , To make the dough: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Mix the tangzhong with the remaining dough ingredients until everything comes together. Let the dough rest, covered, for 20 minutes; this will give the flour a chance to absorb the liquid, making it easier to knead., After 20 minutes, knead the dough — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to make a smooth, elastic, somewhat sticky dough., Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased covered bowl for 60 to 90 minutes, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk., To make the filling: Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon, mixing until the cinnamon is thoroughly distributed., Gently deflate the risen dough, divide it in half, and shape each piece into a rough rectangle., Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough into an 18"" x 8"" rectangle., Sprinkle half the filling onto the rolled-out dough., Starting with a long edge, roll the dough into a log. With the seam underneath, cut the log into 12 slices, 1 1/2"" each.,   ,         , , Repeat with the second piece of dough and the remaining filling., Lightly grease a 9"" x 13"" pan. Space the rolls in the pan., Cover the pan and let the rolls rise for 45 to 60 minutes, until they're crowding one another and are quite puffy., While the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the bottom third., Uncover the rolls, and bake them for 22 to 25 minutes, until they feel set. They might be just barely browned; that's OK. It's better to under-bake these rolls than bake them too long. Their interior temperature at the center should be about 188°F., While the rolls are baking, stir together the icing ingredients, adding enough of the milk to make a thick spreadable icing. The icing should be quite stiff, about the consistency of softened cream cheese., Remove the rolls from the oven, and turn them out of the pan onto a rack. Spread them with the icing; it'll partially melt into the rolls., Serve the rolls warm. Store completely cool rolls for a couple of days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 1 month.

There is no need to activate the yeast beforehand., Turn on the mixer to the lowest setting, and let it go for 15 minutes, occasionally stopping the mixer to push the dough together. If you’re in a humid climate and the dough is too sticky, feel free to add a little more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until it comes together. It should be sticking to the bottom of the bowl, but not the sides. If you don’t have a mixer and would like to knead by hand, extend the kneading time by 5-10 minutes., Cover the bowl with a damp towel and place in a warm spot for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size. (We proof our dough in a closed microwave with a mug of just boiled water next to it.), In the meantime, grease two baking vessels on all sides with butter. We fit 12 rolls in a large oval casserole dish, and 4 into a smaller overflow casserole dish. You can also use two 9-inch cake pans. Keep in mind that these expand quite a bit. You want to ensure they have enough room to expand, but not so much room that they won’t end up hugging each other in the pan once baked., Next, mix the cinnamon sugar filling. In a medium bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, butter, and salt until it’s a brown paste. If you need to, microwave the butter for 15-20 seconds to make it easier to stir., After the dough has doubled in size, put it back in the mixer, and stir for another 5 minutes to get rid of any air bubbles., Roll the dough out into a 12x24 inch (30x60cm) rectangle, at about ¼-inch thickness. Using a butter knife, spread the brown sugar filling evenly over the dough leaving about a ½-inch of border on the sides. Roll it tightly into a big cigar, and cut it into 16 equal pieces. (It helps to score it first in half, then in fourths, and so on)., Arrange the buns in the buttered baking pans (when it comes to the end pieces, place them cut side up) with about ¾-inch between each bun. Proof for another 30-40 minutes., 15 minutes into the last round of proofing, arrange a rack in the middle of the oven, and preheat to 350°F/175°C. After proofing the buns, bake for 20-25 minutes. Ours baked in 25 minutes. If you know your oven runs hot, proceed accordingly. The center buns will look a little pale relative to the ones on the edges, but don’t be tempted to bake them longer!, While the buns are baking, make the cream cheese icing. Whip the cream cheese and butter until fluffy and pale yellow. Add the vanilla extract and powdered sugar. For super thick icing, omit the milk. For a thinner, pourable consistency, add the milk., When the buns are done baking, remove from the oven. Drizzle icing evenly over the buns as desired.

Remove the pan from heat and let it cool slightly., In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook*, add 1 cup (132 g) of the all-purpose flour, yeast, and salt and whisk to combine. Pour the warm milk mixture over the flour mixture and begin to knead on low-medium speed. Add the eggs and knead on medium speed for about 3 minutes or until they are well incorporated into the dough., Then, begin to add the remaining cups of flour until the dough releases from the sides of the bowl and no longer clings. It should be soft and elastic-feeling. Continue to knead the dough on medium speed for 6 minutes or until the dough is soft and smooth., Lightly grease a large bowl. Shape the dough into a tight ball by dragging it towards you on the counter. Then, place the dough ball into the prepared bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Allow it to rise until doubled, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours., Meanwhile, make the Cinnamon Sugar Filling. In a large bowl, beat the butter until soft and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the brown sugar and cinnamon and continue to beat for another 5 to 8 minutes or until it is soft and spreadable like buttercream., Once the dough has finished rising, gently deflate it with your hands. Then, transfer it to a clean work surface. Roll out the dough with a rolling pin into a rectangle about 12 x 16-inches (30 x 41-cm) big., Spread the cinnamon sugar butter all over the surface of the dough, reaching out to the edges and corners., Then, with one of the longest sides of the dough, begin rolling it up like a jellyroll. I like to think of it like a typewriter, working back and forth across the dough to roll it evenly and tightly. Pinch the seam shut., With a piece of thread or thin string, slide it underneath the cinnamon roll. Every 2-inches (5-cm) wrap the thread around the cinnamon roll and over the top and pull tight, slicing the roll in a swift motion. This creates a reall clean cut and does not smash the rolls like you might when cutting with a knife. You should have about 9 large cinnamon rolls when finished., Lightly grease a 10-inch (25-cm) diameter ceramic pie dish. Arrange the cinnamon rolls in the dish and cover them with plastic wrap. Let them rise until nearly doubled, about 45 minutes., While the cinnamon rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 350° F (177° C). Bake the cinnamon rolls in the preheated oven for about 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly golden brown and the insides are no longer raw but still stretchy and gooey.

After 10 minutes, mixture should be foamy. (If nothing has happened, throw it out and try again OR buy fresher yeast.), Add in remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar and 2 cups of flour and start to mix with the machine on low to medium speed with the dough hook attachment. Stir in melted butter and salt. Add in another 1-2 cups and let the machine work to knead it into the dough, about 2 minutes or kneading on low to medium speed. Add in remaining 2 cups of flour (if needed) bit by bit, letting the machine knead in the flour for several seconds before adding in more flour. Only add in enough flour to get a dough that is mostly smooth, has cleaned the sides of the bowl, the bottom is still sticking and when you touch it with your hands, it is tacky but not sticky enough to stick to your hands. This whole process should take about 10 minutes., Scrape the dough out of the bowl and into a well greased large bowl. Roll it around to coat in oil, over and refrigerate 2-3 hours or overnight., Making the Cinnamon Rolls, Flour a clean surface and dump risen dough onto the board. Sprinkle the dough and rolling pin in more flour and start to roll a 24""x18 rectangle (approximately). As you roll, be sure to move the dough around to ensure no sticking. Add more flour as needed., Using your fingers, spread the soft butter over the entire piece of dough, leaving a 1 inch border along the top of a longer 24"" side. Spread the brown sugar over the butter evenly and then sprinkle with cinnamon., Roll dough neatly into a tight swirl, towards the border of dough without cinnamon or sugar. Bring entire log of dough towards you, moving the seam side down to hold in place. Using a serrated bread knife, cut into 1 1/2"" rolls (approximate is fine) and place onto buttered parchment paper on a lightly colored half sheet pan. (You should end up with 16 nice cinnamon rolls and 2 small end pieces that you can squeeze onto the sheet pan too or just toss.), Cover rolls with plastic wrap and rise 1 hour or until puffed and pretty. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until tops are golden brown., For the brown butter icing, In a large skillet with high sides, melt butter over medium heat. After butter has melted, it should start to foam. Swirl butter for 2-3 minutes as it foams until the milk solids start to brown, butter smells nutty and you see medium brown flecks in the butter., Remove from the heat immediately and pour in milk and vanilla.

Tips - Based on the type of yeast used, milk temperatures will vary. Red Star Platinum yeast calls for warmer temperatures than most, 120 to 130F; other brands and yeast call for much lower temperatures, about 95 to 105F. Warm milk according to manufacturer’s recommendations on the packaging. Taking the temperature with a digital thermometer is highly recommended, but if you’re not, make sure the milk is warm, not hot. Err on the cooler rather than hotter side so you don’t kill the yeast. If the milk separates or gets a little funny looking after being warmed, whisk it to smooth it out., To the dry ingredients in the stand mixer, add the melted butter, eggs, buttermilk, and beat on medium-low speed for about 1 minute, or until combined., Switch to the dough hook (the dough will have stuck to the paddle and just pick off what you can and put it into the bowl) and knead for 10 to 12 minutes (15 to 18 minutes by hand)., If after 5 minutes more flour is needed, add the remaining 1/4 cup flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough clears the side of the bowl but sticks to the bottom. Tips - This is a very sticky, tacky, moist, and borderline sloppy dough; don’t be tempted to over-flour it. It’s supposed to be that way. The more flour you add now, the less fluffy and more dense the rolls will be. Dough should clear the sides of the mixer while kneading but sticking to the bottom is fine. However, if the dough is simply too sloppy to work with, you can't move it from mixing bowl to rising bowl, it does need more flour so add some, as little as you can get away with, until you can work with the dough more easily., Remove the dough from the mixing bowl, spray a large mixing bowl with cooking spray, and place the dough in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and place it in a warm, draft-free place to rise for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or doubled in size. I keep my bowl inside a powered-off oven. Every 45 minutes or so, I power on the oven for 1 minute to 400F, as if I am preheating it, then I power it off. Do not, repeat not, keep the oven on. These short bursts of 1 minute of heat create a stable 85F-ish warm environment, ideal for the yeast. If your rising spot is cold, it will take longer than 2 1/2 hours., Prepare a 11-by-17-inch or similar sized jellyroll pan or sheetcake pan with a raised edge, or use a 9-by-13-inch pan. I prefer a jellyroll pan because it’s slightly larger so the rolls are less squished, have more room to rise, and bake more evenly. Line pan with aluminum foil, spray with cooking spray; set aside., Shape the Cinnamon Rolls, After dough has doubled in size, punch it down. Turn dough out onto a floured Silpat or floured countertop. Knead it lightly for about 2 minutes., With a rolling pin, roll it out to a 16-by-12-inch rectangle; just slightly larger than a standard Silpat., With a knife, butter the dough with 1/2 cup soft butter, leaving a 3/4-inch border around the edges., Sprinkle the brown sugar over it. Sprinkle the cinnamon over the brown sugar; I was very generous with the cinnamon and used almost 5 teaspoons and recommend at least 3; just eyeball it and shake it on., Loosen the dough from the counter using a bench scraper (or metal spatula), and starting with a long edge, roll the dough into a tight log. Pinch the seam closed and turn log so seam side is down., Gently stretch the log to be 18 inches in length with an even diameter all the way around and pat the ends to even them up. Don’t fret if your log isn’t perfect; it’s okay., Slice the cylinder into 12 evenly sized rolls (about 1 1/2 inches wide) using a bench scraper, serrated knife, or plain unwaxed dental floss (works great to not squish and compact the log)., Arrange the rolls cut side down in the prepared baking pan. Cover with plastic wrap., If making the rolls straight through: Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until the rolls have nearly doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours., If making the rolls overnight: Don’t let rolls rise after they’ve been sliced and placed in covered pan. Place pan in refrigerator for up to 16 hours. Before baking, let the rolls sit at room temperature until they have nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour., Bake the Rolls, For either version, bake at 350ºF for 22 to 25 minutes, or until lightly golden on top and cooked through but not overly browned., While the rolls cool, make the frosting., Make the Cream Cheese Frosting, To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine 1/2 cup butter, cream cheese, and beat on medium speed to combine, about 1 minute., Add the vanilla, 3 cups confectioners’ sugar (I don’t bother sifting), and beat until smooth and fluffy, about 3 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary., Add remaining 1 cup of sugar (or more, or None) as necessary, to taste, based on desired frosting consistency and flavor., Spread the frosting over the tops of the semi-cooled rolls and serve. Tips - Make sure they're not too warm or the frosting will melt. You may not use all the frosting if you don't like a lot of frosting on your rolls. That's fine, you don't need to use it all. Extra frosting will keep airtight in the fridge for many weeks or you can freeze it.","[('flour', 4.25, 'cups'), ('sugar', 0.33, 'cup'), ('yeast', 2.25, 'teaspoons'), ('salt', None, None), ('butter', 6.0, 'tablespoons'), ('eggs', 3.0, None), ('buttermilk', 0.75, 'cup'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('cinnamon', 3.0, 'teaspoons'), ('butter', 0.5, 'cup'), ('cream cheese', 6.0, 'ounces'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('confectioners’ sugar', 1.0, 'pound'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon')]"

Set aside., In a separate large bowl, stir the egg(s), salt, sugar, and oil together until well blended., Make sure your water is hot, around 120 degrees. If you don't have a culinary thermometer, this temperature should feel uncomfortable to the touch but not painful). Pour the hot water on top of the egg mixture, but don't stir it together yet. (We want to allow our flour and instant yeast to activate when being mixed with the hot water)., Immediately add the flour mixture on top of the hot water, and use a sturdy spatula to stir all of the ingredients together until a dough is formed and the ingredients are well blended. The dough will get firmer, stickier, and more difficult to stir as it thickens., There's no kneading of this dough, as we don't want to incorporate any additional flour, but we want to stir it until it gets stretchy. Leave the dough in the bowl, and continue to scrape the sides and stir the dough with your heavy-duty spatula for around 2-3 minutes, or until the dough is stretchy and uniform. It will be a very sticky dough., Allow the dough to rise at room temperature until double in size, around one hour., Loosely wrap the bowl in plastic wrap, and place the risen dough in the fridge overnight, for at least 4 hours but no more than 24 hours., Day One: Prepare Filling Ingredients, Stir together the brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your fingers to break apart any large brown sugar pieces, and to make sure the cinnamon is thoroughly mixed in. Wrap this mixture or place it in an air-tight container until Day Two., Whisk the Instant Clearjel and Flour together until well blended. Wrap or place in an air-tight container until Day Two., If you'd like, you may take your salted butter out of the fridge so that it is softened and ready to roll in the morning., Day Two: Prepare Pan, The 1 oz of melted butter for brushing will be used three times. First, brush the cake pan(s) generously with melted butter on the bottom, sides, and inner corners. 6 cinnamon rolls fit in a 9x13x2 pan, and 12 cinnamon rolls fit in an 11x15x2 pan., Day Two: Roll Out Cinnamon Rolls, Generously dust your counter with about 1/4 cup of flour., Scrape the risen refrigerated cinnamon roll dough on top of the dusted flour. Use your fingers to scrape out any stuck to the bowl and add it to the dough. The dough will be sticky. Avoid pressing the dough into itself or turning it into a ball--this will overwork the dough. We want to roll it out with very little shaping of the dough. Instead, just lightly dust any sticky portions of the dough, and press any sticky edges into the floured counter. Lightly press the dough into a rectangular shape before rolling (I recommend watching the recipe video)., Roll out the dough into an 9-inch horizontal by 16-inch vertical rectangle. (A 1x batch will be tall and skinny. A 2x batch will be wider than it is tall as seen in the recipe video). Using extra flour only as needed, dust any parts of the dough with flour that sticks to the table or rolling pin., If your butter is firm, microwave it for a few seconds until softened but not melted. Mix your softened butter thoroughly with the prepared Instant Clearjel mixture. Immediately spread it onto the rolled-out dough. We mix this right before spreading so that it doesn't have time to thicken before spreading. Spread it evenly all the way to the very edge of the dough., Pour the prepared Brown Sugar/Cinnamon mixture on top of the butter and spread it evenly all the way to the very edge of the dough., Roll up the cinnamon dough tightly, curving the edges in slightly as you roll (watch the recipe video). This helps maintain a nice roll on the edges and prevents the cinnamon mixture from escaping. When you are left with one inch of dough, pull it up and pinch it tightly against the rolled dough, creating a pinched seam., Dust the seam with flour, and turn your dough so it is seam side down against the floured counter. Shape the roll of dough with your hands if needed so that it is even in thickness. Score the dough with a bench scraper, pastry divider, or knife into 6 rolls, then cut the rolls with a bench scraper or sharp knife., Place the cinnamon rolls into your prepared pan, with little room between each roll and 1/2 inch from the edge of the pan. Lightly press down on each roll so that the edges of each roll barely touch each other, and improve their round form if needed. (The cinnamon rolls will rise into whatever shape they are in now. So if you have some oval or misshapen rolls, use your hands to form the edges into a circle before they rise.), Brush the cinnamon rolls with melted salted butter, then allow to rise at room temperature until double in size, around one hour., Bake the Cinnamon Rolls, Preheat oven to 350 degrees., Bake the risen cinnamon rolls in the preheated 350-degree oven on the middle or top rack for 12 minutes, then turn the oven down to 325 degrees. Bake for an additional 6-8 minutes for six cinnamon rolls in a 9x13 pan, or an additional 12-16 minutes for twelve cinnamon rolls in an 11x15 pan. The cinnamon rolls are done when they are golden brown, and the dough bounces back when you tap it lightly with your finger. Check several areas of the rolls for doneness., While the rolls bake, make the glaze. Whisk the powdered sugar and water together until smooth. It should be thin enough that it melts slightly into the hot rolls., Brush the cinnamon rolls one last time with melted butter. Using a small whisk, drizzle the glaze lightly onto each hot cinnamon roll., These cinnamon rolls are best served warm and have the best soft texture when eaten the same day they are baked.

Take their internal temp with an instant read thermometer - because everyone's ovens cooks different, your buns are probably different sizes than mine...sourdough takes longer to bake than yeast dough...instant read is best way to know they are done and not have doughy buns. You want them to be 190F-200F, When theyre out, this is the fun part! You can eat right away, glaze using the one above, or use your own frosting. If you're frosting them, they need to cool down for about half an hour or your frosting will all melt off.","[('sourdough', 1.0, 'loaf'), ('butter', 0.33, 'cup'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('cinnamon', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('vanilla', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('milk', None, None)]"

I like the little bit of chew that bread flour adds.), 20 grams whole wheat flour, 30 grams organic cane sugar, 7 grams sea salt, 180 grams whole milk, (room temperature), 130 grams active sourdough starter, 1 large egg, (room temperature), 75 grams room temperature (softened unsalted butter, cut into 1/2 tablespoon chunks), 3 tablespoons softened (unsalted butter), 80 grams organic cane sugar, 2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, pinch of salt, 4 ounces full fat ounces cream cheese, (softened), 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temp, 1/2 cup + 1 tablespoon powdered sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt","Add flours, sugar, and salt to bowl of a stand mixer. Stir together. Whisk egg, milk, and starter together in separate bowl until no lumps of starter remain., Attach hook to mixer, and turn on on Kitchenaid speed 2, and gradually add liquid ingredients, until all dry bits are gone. When most of the flour is absorbed, turn mixer to speed 4 and knead for 30 seconds. Mixture will not look smooth, just shaggy. Let sit for 15 minutes., Turn mixer onto speed 2 (using Kitchenaid Stand Mixer) and add one chunk of butter at a time to the dough, only adding another chunk once the previous is fully incorporated into the dough. Keep doing this until the butter is all added to the dough., Once all the butter is in the dough, turn KitchenAid up to speed 4 and continue kneading for 7 minutes - the dough will be smooth, and cleaning the sides of the bowl. It will be slightly sticky to the touch still., Overnight rise: Once kneading is done, place the dough in a bowl and cover with a damp cloth, or place bowl inside garbage bag. Leave at room temp to rise until double, about 9-10 hours if your home is at 70 degrees F. It will take longer if your home is cooler, less time if your home is warmer. *Because this is a brioche dough, it takes significantly longer to rise - don't be alarmed., In the morning, the dough will have doubled, have a smooth top and be domed. Turn it out onto a heavily floured counter. Gently pat it into a rectangle shape and let rest for 10 minutes., Using a floured rolling pin, roll it into a large rectangle roughly 17″x 12, making the rectangle so that one of the longest sides is closest to you., To make the filling: Use your fingers to spread the softened butter onto the dough keeping 1/2"" away from edges. This will seem odd, but this technique prevents the filling from leaking out while rising. Mix cinnamon, sugar, and salt in small bowl. Evenly distribute the mixture on top of butter., Then use your bench scraper to begin rolling up the dough into a log starting with the long edge closest to you. Use a little extra flour on the bench scraper each time to help pick the dough up from the surface. Don’t worry if it sticks a little, just use a little more flour dust. Roll it down to the top edge and pinch the edge to the dough log to seal it., You should have a long log of dough roughly 17″ long. Now cut the dough log with your bench scraper, at 1 1/2 to 2"" intervals (you should get 8 or 9 rolls) and place the rolls into a liberally buttered or greased 9 x 13 inch aluminum pan., Place the pan inside a clean garbage bag and fold the opening over so that no air gets inside. Leave at room temp (in a warm spot if possible) to proof until rolls have risen about 50% in size, this takes about 2ish hours if your house is at 70 degrees (less if it is warm in your home or summer time). If you have a warm spot in your home, put them there to speed things up.They should look like the picture above in the post, denoted with a caption that says, ""after proofing, ready for oven."", When the rolls are done proofing, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place pan in oven, turn down to 375 degrees F, and bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown at the edges, set in the middles and smelling done. Remove and let cool for 15 minutes., Make the Frosting: Beat cream cheese and butter together until smooth. Add remaining ingredients and beat until smooth and airy. When rolls have cooled for 15 minutes, frost them. This will allow the icing to melt into them a bit and create the most fabulous icing.","[('flour', 300.0, 'grams'), ('flour', 20.0, 'grams'), ('flour', 20.0, 'grams'), ('sugar', 30.0, 'grams'), ('salt', 7.0, 'grams'), ('milk', 180.0, 'grams'), ('starter', 130.0, 'grams'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('butter', 75.0, 'grams'), ('butter', 3.0, 'tablespoons'), ('sugar', 80.0, 'grams'), ('cinnamon', 2.5, 'teaspoons'), ('salt', 1.0, 'pinch'), ('cream cheese', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('butter', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('sugar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('vanilla extract', 1.5, 'teaspoons'), ('salt', 0.25, 'teaspoon')]"

Set aside., Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment paper., Assembling the rolls:, Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface and press it into a 10” x 12” rectangle that’s about 1/2” thick. For evenly shaped rolls, try to pat the dough into an actual rectangle (with corners), rather than an oval., Sprinkle the filling over the dough, covering all but a 1/2” strip along one long side., Starting with the filling-covered long side, roll the dough into a log., Cut the dough lightly into eight equal 1 1/2” to 2” pieces.

The milk should be warm, just a bit above body temperature. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar and the active dry yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes so the yeast will activate., While the yeast activates, combine the flour, salt, and remaining sugar in the bowl of your mixer., Once the yeast is activated, you should see bubbles on the surface of the mixture. Pour it onto the flour mixture. Add the heavy cream, egg, butter, and sesame paste. Stir with a spatula until everything just comes together (do not over stir). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest for 20 minutes., Install the dough hook on your mixer (I used a KitchenAid). Start at low speed, then gradually increase to setting 6 out of 10. Knead for 10 to 12 minutes, until the dough is very smooth. Test the dough by pulling a piece of it using both of your hands. It should stretch into a very thin and translucent sheet. The dough should be soft, a bit sticky, but not stick to your fingers., Grease a big bowl with a thin layer of oil. Place the dough in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until the dough doubles in size, 50 to 70 minutes., Prepare the filling, Prepare the filling while resting the dough. Combine the softened butter with the sesame paste in a small bowl.

Stir to mix well., Assemble, Line a 13” x 9” (33cm x 23 cm) baking pan with parchment paper., Punch the air out of the dough. Transfer it onto a lightly floured working surface. Use your hands to form the dough into a rectangle so it’s easy to roll., Roll the dough with a rolling pin until it forms a 17”x13” (43cm x 33cm) rectangular sheet. Use a dough cutter or a knife to slice off the irregular edges and discard., Add the butter sesame paste mixture onto the dough. Use the back of a spoon to spread it out into a thin, even layer. Make sure to leave a thin gap on the top of the long edge without the paste, so it won't spill when you roll up the dough., Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly over the sesame paste., Starting at the top of the long side (17” / 43cm), tightly roll the dough towards yourself into a long log. Once fully rolled, make sure the seam is tableside down. Press gently to seal., Use a sharp knife to cut the dough. Slice off the irregular part on both edges and discard the dough. Score the roll, once in the center, then in the center of the two halves, then 3 times between each quarter. Slice along the scored lines, making 12 cinnamon rolls. Transfer the cinnamon rolls onto the parchment paper, evenly spaced, in a 4 by 3 array., Cover the baking pan with plastic wrap. Let rise again for 30 minutes., Bake & garnish, Preheat the oven to 350° F (176° C). Bake the cinnamon rolls on the middle rack for 25 minutes. The top of the cinnamon rolls should turn golden brown, and the inside fully cooked., Prepare the glaze while the rolls are baking. Whisk together the confectioners sugar, milk, and sesame paste in a small bowl, until it forms a runny glaze., Once the cinnamon rolls are baked, let rest for 5 minutes. Drizzle the glaze on top of the rolls., Serve and store, I highly recommend serving the cinnamon rolls when they’re fresh out of the oven and still warm. At this point, they’re super soft inside and crispy on the outside., Once cooled completely, you can store them in an airtight container on your kitchen counter for 1 to 2 days. Due to the very soft and moist dough, the cinnamon rolls will have dried out a bit by the second day. I usually microwave a roll for 10 seconds or leave it in a 350° F (176° C) oven to warm up before serving., For longer storage, place the cinnamon rolls in a ziplock bag, squeeze out as much air as possible, and store them in the freezer for up to a month.

In a large bowl or stand mixer, add 6 tablespoons softened butter. Beat well until it is creamy and smooth. Add 3/4 cup packed brown sugar and 1 and 1/2 tablespoons cinnamon. Beat well, scraping sides down, until completely smooth. Line a baking sheet or large platter with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Clear out space in your freezer, if possible.Use a spoon to create small balls of filling, about the size of a marble. Line them up on the prepared pan, you should have quite a few (see photos). Place in the freezer if you can fit it in. Freeze for 20 minutes until hardened. If you only have room in the fridge, you will have to wait about an hour or two until they are firm., Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and prepare a couple more baking sheets with parchment paper, or line with a silicone mat. (You can use the pan in the freezer to bake later, too), Make the dough. In the same large bowl or stand mixer (no need to wash it), beat 1 cup butter for a couple minutes until smooth, scraping the sides and bottom a few times in between., Add 1 and 2/3 cup white sugar. Beat for 2 minutes, taking the time to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl in between. Your butter and sugar should be light and fluffy with no chunks at all., Add 2 eggs and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Beat well, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl. Make sure you beat it long enough that it becomes smooth and homogenous., Add 3 and 1/2 cups flour but don't mix it in yet (make sure you spoon and level your flour)., Use a small spoon (I use my teaspoon) to stir in 1 teaspoon baking soda, 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar into the flour. Gently beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Don't overdo it. There should still be flour streaks when you stop your mixer. Use a spatula to scrape down the edges of the bowl., Continue beating just a few more seconds until all the flour streaks are gone. Do not over mix! You want to make sure all the ingredients are combined, but once that is done, stop mixing. Over mixing dough = tough cookies., Mix in. Once your small balls of cinnamon filling are frozen and firm, you can add them to the dough. Do not use a stand mixer or hand mixer. Instead, fold them in with a wooden spoon or a spatula., Use a large cookie scoop or a spoon to shape the dough. You want dough balls that are about 2 inches across. I used this cookie scoop. and overfilled it slightly for each scoop. See photos., Roll the cookies. In a small or medium bowl, add 1/3 cup sugar and 1 and 1/2 tablespoons cinnamon. Stir together. Roll the shaped cookies in the cinnamon-sugar to coat., Place cookie dough balls on the prepared baking sheet with about 2 inches in between them. I can fit 12 cookies on an 11x17 baking sheet. But as you can see from the photos, they kind of run into each other. You can fix this with the spooning technique, but if you want to play it safe add 8 cookies to a pan., Bake the cookies at 350 for about 11-12 minutes. These cookies are not going to look done when you take them out of the oven because the cinnamon filling will stay shiny. The edges of the cookies that DON'T have cinnamon filling pooling out the side should be firm but not golden. The top (white) part of the cookies should be matte (not shiny), at least on the outer edges. The cinnamon filling will be shiny and may or may not be spreading quite a bit. You might think these cookies are going to flatten out and crisp up and fail, but never fear, we have a plan:, Shape the cookies. Immediately after taking the cookies out of the oven (like seriously, within 30-60 seconds before the edges crisp), use a couple spoons to push the edges of the cookies toward their centers. Shape them back into the circle that they were meant to be. See photos! Scrape up all that oozing cinnamon sugar goodness and pack it into the edge of the cookies, pushing the cookies in on themselves. This makes the cookies thicker, chewier, and solves the problem of the cinnamon filling spreading everywhere., Let the cookies set up on the pan for at least 5 minutes. Remove the cookies to a wire rack. Then eat one as fast as you can with a glass of milk! Cinnamon roll blissss!! Don't forget to try out my regular Snickerdoodle recipe sometime, it's almost the same recipe but instead of the cinnamon filling, it gets double dipped in cinnamon-sugar before and after baking. They are perfectly soft and chewy!, Freezer instructions: You can freeze this dough and bake later! I like to shape the dough into balls, roll them in cinnamon sugar, and store them in a ziplock bag.

Turn the mixer off and cover the tip of the mixing bowl with a towel and wait for the dough to rise until doubled in size. (This can take anywhere from an hour to a hour and a half but it's more important to go by eye than by time.), For the Filling:, Cream together the sugar, softened butter, cinnamon, nutmeg, orange zest and orange juice until smooth. Mixture should be room temperature when you are ready to spread it out on the dough., Turn the risen dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a rectangle approximately 16 inches high by 20 inches wide., Spread the sugar and cinnamon filling evenly over the rolled out dough., To create cinnamon buns in the traditional shape: Roll ip your rectangular sheet of dough from the long edge into a tight log. Cut into approximately 12 evenly sized rolls., To create cinnamon buns in the braided style (as seen in the photos): Begin with your 16 inch high by 20 inch wide rectangle of dough. Fold up the bottom edge to meet the middle of the dough. Now fold down the top edge even with the new bottom edge. Trim off the rough edges with a sharp knife or bench scraper. Cut strips from top to bottom that are approximately 2 1/2 inches wide. You should be able to get 10-12 strips. Take each individual strop and leaving an inch of dough at the top, make two cuts to create three sections of dough for braiding. Braid the three strands and then roll from the top down. (If you're struggling message me on Instagram and I'll help you!), Place buns in a 9x13 inch baking dish., Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

In the picture, I used a small cast iron skillet and placed them all together so they were touching. This is a fine way to do it but you will have to cook it longer and I think it prevents the rolls from being as soft as they could be. If you were to place them separately on the sheet pan, it will cook a bit more evenly but if you aren't able to achieve a tight roll, they will tip over. Not a huge issue but something to consider., Bake for 10-12 minutes if you put them on the pan apart from eachother.

Using a rubber spatula, stir together to form a shaggy dough., Place the bowl on the stand mixer and attach the dough hook. Turn the mixer to medium-speed and knead the dough for about 10 minutes, or the dough is still soft, silky, and pulling away from the edges of the bowl., Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for 1 hour, or until it’s puffed up and doubled in size., For the Filling:, In a medium bowl, add the brown sugar, orange zest, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, allspice, nutmeg, ground cardamom, and salt and mix well to evenly combine., Cut the butter into small cubes and set aside until needed., For Assembly & Baking:, Dust the counter lightly with flour. Scrape the dough out onto the counter and sprinkle the top of the dough with a little more flour. Gently, roll the dough into a rectangle about 22x16-inches wide., Spread the softened butter evenly over the dough, leaving a 1/4-inch border around the edge. Sprinkle evenly with the brown sugar mixture., Starting from the long edge closest to you, roll the dough into a log, jelly roll style, keeping it as tight as possible while rolling. (Note: The tighter the roll, the less filling that will leak out during baking.), Score the dough lightly into 12 equal pieces. Cut the dough at the score marks. The easiest way to do this is to slide a long piece of unflavored dental floss under the dough. Wrap it up around the score mark, and then pull the two sides tightly in opposite directions to pull the floss through the roll. Repeat for all rolls., Carefully arrange the rolls in the prepared pan, making four rows of three cinnamon rolls.

Mix well with a wire whisk. Pour into the mixer bowl and secure the dough hook attachment to your mixer., Add the butter, butter flavored shortening and eggs. Add 3 cups of the bread flour. Mix for about 30 seconds until ingredients are incorporated. Stop the mixer and scrape down sides of bowl with a spatula., Turn mixer on low and add 2 more cups of the bread flour, 1/2 cup at a time. After adding the 2 cups of flour, let dough continue to mix for about 1 minute. Stop and scrape the sides of the bowl as needed. If dough is not mostly cleaning sides of the bowl, add more flour 1/4 cup at a time until it cleans the sides of the bowl. Stop the mixer and check the dough by gently pressing your finger into it. If the dough does not stick to your finger, it should be ready to knead. *When in doubt, it’s always best to go lighter on the flour. You can always add more flour, but you can’t take flour away. Too much flour in your dough will give you dry, dense rolls., Knead on low speed for 5 minutes., Remove dough from mixer and place in a greased bowl. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 60-90 minutes., Melt ¼ cup salted butter in microwave safe dish and set aside., In separate bowl combine the brown sugar and cinnamon., Divide dough into two 28-30-ounce portions. If you don’t have a scale, you can eyeball it. Round each portion to an oval shaped piece of dough by pulling and tucking it under. This will make it easier to roll it out into a rectangle., Flour your work surface and roll dough out to a rectangular shape, about 10 inches by 18 inches., Spread half of the melted butter on the dough, leaving an inch border on the top side of the rectangle. Sprinkle about 1/4 – 1/3 cup of brown sugar on top of the melted butter, continuing to leave the inch border at the top edge. Leaving this border will help in sealing the dough shut when rolled up., Start with the long side closest to you, and working from left to right begin to roll dough up. You can tug and pull as you go which will tighten the roll and make more swirls., Once it’s all rolled up, pinch the seam shut., Using kitchen scissors, cut 1-inch pieces at a 45-degree angle, cutting only 3/4 of the way through the roll. Each roll will have about 15-18 cinnamon rolls. *Make sure the roll is seam side down when you do this., Repeat with second ball of dough or see Notes for other options to use this dough., Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place a 4-inch oven safe bowl or ramekin in the center. Spray the outside of it with nonstick spray. Arrange the roll around the ramekin with the cut side facing outwards. The ramekin will ensure that you get a perfectly round center for your cinnamon roll wreath! Fan the rolls out, laying them slightly on top of one another. Use your scissors to make the cuts a bit deeper if needed when spreading the cinnamon rolls out. (Be sure to watch my video showing this in more detail), Let the cinnamon roll wreath rise, covered until it increases in size about 50%. This should take about 30-45 minutes, depending on how warm your kitchen is., Bake, Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake on the center rack for 16-20 minutes, until edges are golden brown. Internal temperature should read 195°F. Once you remove it from the oven, place on a wire cooling rack. Let it cool for 20 minutes before removing the ramekin from the center., Frost with my Cream Cheese Frosting, adding about one extra Tablespoon of milk to make it a bit runnier. Frost the cinnamon roll wreath while it’s still slightly warm – this will make the frosting melt a bit, revealing all of the beautiful cinnamon swirls., Serve by either pulling apart each roll or cutting with a serving spatula.

Add a pinch of sugar from the 1/3 cup sugar and allow the yeast to activate. After 5 minutes, the yeast mixture should be foamy and fluffy., In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, add remaining sugar, flour, nutmeg, and salt. Stir with a spatula to combine. Add the butter chunks, beaten eggs and finally the yeasty milk mixture. Stir again with a spatula to combine into a shaggy dough., Place the mixer on medium speed and allow to knead for 3 minutes. Stop the mixer, scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and return to medium speed to knead for another 5 minutes. The dough should mostly come into a cohesive ball that gathers around the dough hook. The bottom of the dough may stick to the bowl. If the dough seems too sticky to do this, add a few more tablespoons of flour., Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead by hand a few turns just to ensure the dough is smooth and bouncy. Lightly grease a bowl (you can absolutely use the bowl you mixed the dough in), place the dough in the greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and allow to proof until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour., To make the filling, in a small bowl combine orange zest, sugar, and spices. Rub together with your fingers until evenly combined and fragrant., To make the glaze, place cream cheese in a medium bowl. Make sure that the cream cheese is very well softened and if not, microwave it for a few seconds to make sure it’s supremely softened. Use a spatula to spread the cream cheese around the bowl, making it super pliable. Add the softened butter and stir until no lumps from either the cream cheese or butter remain., Add the orange zest, powdered sugar, salt, and vanilla bean paste and slowly work to combine. Drizzle in orange juice and stir until smooth. Cover and set aside., When the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured counter and press gently. Use a rolling pin to roll into a 14×20-inch rectangle, with the longest side facing you., Spread with softened butter. Sprinkle generously with orange sugar. Starting from the long side nearest you, roll into a tight coil ending seam side down. Slide a piece of plain dental floss under the middle of the dough and bring the ends of the floss up and around the log and pull together to cut the dough cleanly. Use the same technique to divide each half log into six equal pieces, about 1 ½-inches thick, for 12 rolls total. Arrange rolls in a lightly greased 9×13-inch baking dish, cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator overnight., Remove the rolls from the refrigerator. Allow to come to room temperature and proof slightly for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Place a rack in the upper third or center of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Uncover the rolls and bake for 25-30 minutes until golden and puffed and cooked through. Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes. While still warm, top with half of the glaze mixture. Allow to soak in. Cool the rolls even further, 15-20 minutes, and glaze once again. Serve warm and enjoy! Rolls are best the day they are made but last up to 3 days.

Pour the warm milk into the bowl of a stand electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (OR you can use a handheld mixer OR no mixer, but a stand mixer is ideal). With a whisk, manually whisk in the sugar and yeast. Cover with a towel and let sit until the yeast is foamy, about 5-10 minutes. If the yeast does not dissolve and foam, start over with fresh active yeast. On low speed, beat in the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Next add the eggs, one at a time, and then the salt. The butter won’t really be mixing into the mixture, so don’t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. On low speed, gradually add the flour. Once it is all added, beat on medium speed until a soft dough forms. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until the dough is soft and supple, about 6 minutes longer. *If you do not have a stand-mixer with a hook attachment, knead the dough by hand in this step., Knead the, dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., Form the dough into a ball and transfer it to a lightly greased bowl. Cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap, a paper towel, or aluminum foil and let sit in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 to 2 hours. Here’s what I do: turn the oven on to 200°F (93°C). Once heated to that temperature, turn the oven off. Stick the covered dough inside the oven and allow it to rise in this warm environment., Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Lightly flour the parchment paper. Place the dough on top and, with floured hands, pat down to roughly form a 10×20-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick., For the filling:, Spread the softened butter all over the dough. In a small bowl, toss the cinnamon and sugar together until combined and then sprinkle evenly over the dough. Tightly roll up the dough to form a 20-inch long log. Cut into 20 1-inch rolls, only slicing 3/4 of the way through so they are still connected at the bottom. Use kitchen shears if you need to., Shape the wreath, Turn one of the end cinnamon rolls on its side. Turn the next one so that it slightly overlaps the first. Repeat with each roll, forming into a circle and overlapping each. Again, kitchen shears help to cut any dough as you’re shaping., Place a ramekin in the middle of the wreath. This will help it hold its shape., Cover the wreath loosely with plastic wrap and slide a baking sheet underneath the whole thing. Use a large one with no edges so it can slide under easily. Allow to rise again in a warm environment until puffy, about 45 minutes – 1 hour., Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Bake for about 25 minutes, until the rolls are golden brown.

Add the warm milk and sugar to a bowl and whisk until sugar is dissolved., Now add your egg yolks and sourdough starter to the mixture and whisk until they are well beaten and blended through the milk and sugar., To this add your flour and salt and bring together into a rough dough. Allow the dough to sit, covered at room temperature, for around half an hour., Now, tip the shaggy dough out onto the counter and knead it a little., Add the butter, little by little, kneading it into the dough until all the butter has been used up (see notes for using a stand mixer for this if you prefer not to do it by hand).The dough should be fairly soft and elastic, but not sticky., Transfer to the dough to a bowl and allow to ferment, covered with some plastic wrap or elastic food cover.. You want the dough to rise a little (around 30%) and feel soft to the touch. This needs to happen at room temp - not in the fridge., Once the dough has finished bulk ferment, you will need to fill and shape the cinnamon rolls., Rolling and Filling the Dough, Before you roll out the dough, take the egg and milk and whisk together to create an egg wash. Set this aside., In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon and flour and mix together until it resembles beach sand (it's quite dry and that's ok)., Turn the dough out on to the counter. It shouldn't be sticky and be easy the handle. Do not use flour when rolling out the dough., Divide the dough into two pieces and roll each one out into a rectangle (around 30cm long by 15cm wide)., Using a pastry brush, brush egg wash onto the whole surface of the dough rectangles., Now spread the filling all over the dough, leaving a 2cm gap on one of the long edges. You need to leave a gap so that dough will stick to itself when you roll it., Once the filling is spread, roll the dough into a log, starting on the opposite long edge to the gap you've left., Roll the dough into a tight log, using the unfilled dough to seal the log.Lay the log out with the seam underneath., Cut each log into approximately 10 cinnamon rolls. A metal dough scraper is perfect for this., Take a cookie sheet that has been lined with parchment paper and arrange the sourdough cinnamon rolls into the shape of a Christmas tree. Try to get the seams of each cinnamon roll facing inwards so that they don't come undone when they are baked.Gently press the rolls down with your fingers to fill the Christmas tree shape out., Second Rise, Cover the tray with a damp kitchen towel and leave the sourdough cinnamon rolls to proof. You want them to be nice and puffy before you bake them.Once the dough is puffy, you can bake them straight away - or see baking timeline above to extend the second rise and hold them in the fridge overnight., Baking, Once the rolls are puffy, it's time to bake them. Preheat your oven to 180C/356F., Bake rolls for 30 minutes at 180C/356F. Keep an eye on them though as they will burn easily due to the sugar., Once they're finished baking, leave them to cool on the tray for around 10 minutes before transferring them to a platter or cooling rack., You can brush them with butter to give them a nice glaze. You can leave them unbuttered if you prefer. The butter will give them a nice shine., Vanilla Cream Cheese Frosting, Add cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla and salt to a mixing bowl and beat the frosting until it's thick and glossy (you can use a whisk or spatula). Alternatively you can use a stand mixer to make the frosting. Store in the fridge until ready to use., Once the rolls have cooled a little (I leave it about 30 minutes) smother them in the vanilla cream cheese frosting. You can use a vanilla glaze or even just dust them in icing sugar if you prefer.For the photos you can see in this recipe, I've used a piping bag with a star tip.","[('bread flour', 500.0, 'g'), ('sourdough starter', 100.0, 'g'), ('milk', 220.0, 'g'), ('salt', 7.0, 'g'), ('egg yolks', 2.0, None), ('sugar', 50.0, 'g'), ('butter', 50.0, 'g'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('milk', 20.0, 'g'), ('brown sugar', 100.0, 'g'), ('cinnamon', 15.0, 'g'), ('all purpose flour', 10.0, 'g'), ('cream cheese', 125.0, 'g'), ('butter', 25.0, 'g'), ('powdered sugar', 100.0, 'g'), ('vanilla extract', 5.0, 'g'), ('salt', 1.0, None)]"

The dough will be somewhat sticky from the butter and egg., For the First Proofing Session, Lightly oil a large mixing bowl., Place the dough inside the bowl., Cover the dough with a clean tea towel, plastic wrap, or a reusable bowl cover., Leave the dough somewhere warm for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size (see Kitchen Notes below)., For the Cinnamon-Sugar Filling, Just before the dough is ready, make the filling by beating together the ingredients., To Shape the Christmas Cinnamon Rolls, Line a baking pan measuring 35 x 25 cm/14 x 10 inches with baking paper., Once the dough has doubled in size, gently remove the dough from the bowl. The dough will deflate as you handle it., Roll out the dough into a rectangle shape measuring approximately 50 x 30 cm/20 x 12 inches., Use a small palette knife to evenly spread the filling all over the dough., Roll up the dough tightly from the long end, i.e. to produce a log that is 50 cm/16 inches long., Cut the dough into 12 even pieces. I find it easiest to do so using a long piece of unflavoured dental floss, which will allow you to slice through the dough cleanly and sharply, and without flattening the dough. Simply slide the floss under the dough, then pull both ends of the floss across each other, which will cut through the dough as you pull., Arrange the slices of dough in the baking pan., For the Second Proofing Session, Place the pan somewhere warm for about 30 minutes, or until the buns have risen and puffed up slightly., To Bake the Christmas Cinnamon Rolls, Preheat the oven to 200°C/390°F (without fan) with a metal baking tray on the middle shelf., Place the pan of buns on the preheated baking tray., Bake the buns for 10 minutes., Reduce the heat to 180°C/356°F and bake for another 20 minutes, or until the buns are lightly golden. Check the buns at about 10 minutes, and if they are browning too quickly, cover them with a loose sheet of foil for the rest of the baking time., The buns are cooked if an internal thermometer reads 85°C/185°F., Gently remove the buns (intact) to a wire rack, and leave them to cool completely., To Ice the Cinnamon Rolls, Make the icing by whisking together the ingredients. Add the milk gradually until the icing is a thick, but runny, consistency., Make the Cardamom-Sugar Topping by mixing together the sugar and freshly ground cardamom seeds in a small bowl., Drizzle the icing all over the cooled Christmas Cinnamon Rolls., Sprinkle some Cardamom-Sugar Topping over each roll. To reduce the sweetness of the buns, you can omit the sugar and just sprinkle freshly ground cardamom seeds instead., The Christmas Cinnamon Rolls can be served immediately or once the icing has set. They are best eaten the same day they are baked.","[('white bread flour', 600.0, 'g'), ('caster sugar', 110.0, 'g'), ('fine salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('instant dried yeast', 14.0, 'g'), ('ground cinnamon', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('ground nutmeg', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('ground ginger', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('milk', 375.0, 'ml'), ('unsalted butter', 60.0, 'g'), ('unsalted butter', 125.0, 'g'), ('light brown sugar', 125.0, 'g'), ('ground cinnamon', 3.0, 'teaspoons'), ('freshly ground cardamom seeds', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('fine salt', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('icing sugar', 135.0, 'g'), ('milk', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('unsalted butter', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('granulated sugar', 3.0, 'tablespoons'), ('freshly ground cardamom seeds', 2.0, 'teaspoons')]"

Turn the speed up to medium to continue bringing all of the ingredients together. Knead the dough at medium speed for 6-7 minutes, adding an additional tablespoon of flour at a time if needed. The dough will be very sticky to start, but will become less so as you build up the gluten. Continue kneading until the dough is very elastic and pulls cleanly off the sides of the bowl. Then, let the dough rest for 5-7 minutes., While the dough is resting, mix the slightly melted butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a small bowl to prepare the filling. After resting, transfer the dough to a floured surface and roll it out into a 12×14 inch rectangle (with the long end facing you). It doesn't have to be a perfect measurement! Spread the filling in an even layer over the dough., Starting from the long edge, begin rolling the dough away from you into a tight roll.

The dough ball should be soft and quickly morph to fit the shape of your bowl., Allow the dough to rise at room temperature (about 78 degrees F) covered for 3 to 4 hours., During the rise time, stretch and fold the dough twice. Using a spatula or your hands, stretch up the bottom of the dough, without breaking it, and fold over the top of the dough. Stretch and fold the side over side, then top over bottom. As you do this you’ll notice there is more resistance stretching the dough., Remove the dough from the bowl and place it on a well-floured surface.

I just use my hands to do this., Line a medium baking dish with parchment paper., Gently roll up the dough. Work quickly so the dough holds its shape. You can roll the dough along the longer side or the shorter side. I like to roll along the longer side to get more rolls, and along the shorter side for thicker rolls., Cut the dough into slices and place the slices in your parchment paper-lined baking dish with the swirls facing upward.

Punch down dough., Flour a large clean table liberally with flour. Lightly flour dough as well. Roll dough out to be a 20×30 rectangle {or as close to that as possible} while moving dough around to ensure it’s not sticking to your work surface. If it’s a little short or uneven, feel free to cut off the edges to even it all out. {FYI-I cut off some dough on one side and filled in a spot that needed more dough on the other side to make a more even rectangle.}, Spread softened margarine over dough, being sure to go right to the edges leaving a 1-inch strip untouched on one of the longer sides of dough. Dump brown sugar mixture onto the middle of the dough and spread with your hands, creating an even layer over top of the margarine, still leaving that 1-inch strip of dough untouched. If you have any filling that falls off the sides of the dough, use a bench scraper to replace., Lightly press the sugar mixture into the margarine using a rolling pin. Roll the dough up into a tight log, finishing with the plain dough on the bottom to seal the entire thing together. Cut off the uneven ends to even out the log. Score log every 1 1/2 inches or so and then slice your rolls using those marks.

To the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook, add the warmed milk and melted butter. Feel the mixture with your finger (make sure you feel in the center of the milk/butter mixture) and make sure it is not too hot. You want the temperature to feel like a baby's bathwater. If it is too hot, let it cool a bit before proceeding., Add the sugar and instant yeast to the milk/butter mixture. Stir. Look for the yeasty smell that tells you the yeast is activating (should happen within 10-20 seconds) and then proceed with the recipe., Add the eggs, salt and a cup of flour. Turn on the dough hook on in your stand mixer and continue adding the flour a cup at a time until you have added 5 cups of flour. Knead for 1 minute until all the flour is fully incorporated. Check the dough by rolling it into a ball in your fingers to see if you need more flour. If the dough is too sticky to roll into a ball, continue adding flour 1/4 cup at a time, kneading for 1 minute after each addition. This process will make sure you don't over-flour the dough. Once you can pinch off a piece of dough and roll it into a ball with just a little sticky residue on your fingers, you can stop adding flour. Knead for a total of 5-7 minutes., Lightly oil (or spray with cooking spray) a large container and dump the dough in the container. Cover lightly with a kitchen towel and set in a warm place to rise. I like to turn my oven into a ""proofing box"" with the oven light turned on. This is a nice warm spot for my dough to rise and speeds ups the process a bit.

Set aside., Assembling the Cinnamon Rolls, Prepare two half sheet pans (18 by 13 inches) and cover with parchment paper., Once the dough has doubled in size, move it from the bowl to a clean space on the counter. The dough will be soft and not overly sticky. Pat the dough out into an approximate 18 by 12 rectangle., Spread the cinnamon filling all over the dough with your fingers, making sure to cover up to the edges of the cinnamon roll., Starting with the dough closest to you, roll up the cinnamon roll and pinch together the seam. Flip the cinnamon roll over, seam side down., Cut the long log of cinnamon roll dough into 12 equal pieces., Place the cinnamon rolls on the parchment paper, six or eight to a pan, leaving plenty of space to rise.

If you want an extra gooey cinnamon roll, warm up some heavy cream and drizzle it over the top of the cinnamon roll before sticking in the oven. Bake the cinnamon rolls for 10 minutes. Then rotate the pan and bake for another 8-10 minutes until just starting to brown., Check the middle of one of the cinnamon rolls by using a butter knife to pry up a bit of the roll and make sure it is baked to your liking (the center will tell you if it needs more time or is perfectly baked)., Let the rolls cool for 5 minutes before covering with frosting., Freeze any extra frosted cinnamon rolls in a ziplock bag.

Cut the butter into the flour mixture until the mixture is like coarse meal and the butter is in small, pellet-sized pieces (slightly smaller than a pea). This will take a few short pulses in the food processor., Pour in the buttermilk and mix/pulse only until just combined. The dough should start to come together but you don’t want to overmix the dough. If there are lots of dry patches throughout the dough, add a bit more buttermilk, just a tablespoon or two at a time until the dough comes together (it’s ok to have dry bits here and there)., Scrape the dough out of the food processor or bowl onto a lightly floured counter., Gently pat (do not roll with a rolling pin!) the dough to about 1/2-inch thick. Gently fold the dough in thirds (see visual below), repeating three times and pressing gently to 1-inch thick after each fold.

Carefully watch the dough. You may need a few tablespoons less or more than the recipe indicates depending on your altitude, brand of flour, and humidity.

Remove from the heat and store in refrigerator while you wait to assemble your rolls.

Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into about a rectangle about 1/4-1/2 inch thick, making sure the dough is smooth and even in the corners. Spread an even layer of the chilled raspberry filling. PRO TIP: Because raspberry sauce can be a bit slippery, I've found great results in chilling the dough first before assembling.

The next morning, preheat the oven to 350°F and let the rolls get back to room temperature and rise (usually takes about 1 hour). Baking immediately: Keep the rolls in a draft free place and let them rise until they've grown and the dough gets soft and puffy, usually about 25 minutes. While they're resting, preheat the oven to 350°F. Bake for 16-20 minutes. I like to cover them with foil about half way through so they don't brown as much on top. They're done when the tops and bottoms are starting to get lightly golden and it doesn't look doughy., Frosting: While the rolls bake, make the frosting (or make in advance night before). Beat the butter and cream cheese together, then add remaining ingredients and beat until light and spreadable. Add milk if needed to get to desired consistency. Spread the frosting on while warm and serve immediately., Storing: Store airtight for up to 5 days.

I like to turn my oven onto 170 degrees and then turn it off, it creates the perfect warm environment., For the Filling, While the dough is rising, gather your ingredients for the strawberry filling. In a medium-sized saucepan, add the strawberries and sugar. Stir constantly for 5 minutes until they start to release their juices. Mix corn starch and water together and stir it into the strawberry mixture. Allow to thicken, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow the strawberry filling to cool to room temperature., Stir together the cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl and set aside for later., Pat it down lightly to release the air inside and roll it with a rolling pin into a very large rectangle, about 12 x 24. Smear the butter on into an even layer and sprinkle the cinnamon sugar on top. Pat it down lightly to pack it down. Top with a hearty layer of strawberry preserves., Roll the dough up very tightly into a long log. Cut the log into 12 or 16 cinnamon rolls. 12 for a large 9x13 pan or 16 for two round 8"" baking pans (8 rolls in each). Grease your pan of choice extremely well and place cut rolls into prepared pan., At this point, if you are preparing these for the next day, wrap them TIGHTLY with saran wrap (you do not want any air to get in and dry out the dough) and refrigerate until you are ready. Remove from the refrigerator and set back into warm environment for the second rise., Allow them to rise in a warm place one more time until puffy, about thirty minutes., Once rolls have done their second rise. preheat the oven to 350°F and arrange the rack into the center of the oven. Bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until lightly golden on top., For the frosting, Beat cream cheese and butter together until smooth with no lumps. Mix in powdered sugar and vanilla until smooth and creamy. Spread half of the frosting onto the rolls while they are warm and the second half once they have cooled.","[('yeast', 1.0, 'standard packet'), ('milk', 1.0, 'cup'), ('sugar', 0.67, 'cup'), ('butter', 0.5, 'cup'), ('eggs', 2.0, None), ('egg yolk', 1.0, None), ('flour', 4.5, 'cups'), ('strawberries', 1.5, 'cup'), ('sugar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('cornstarch', 1.0, 'tbs'), ('water', 1.0, 'tbs'), ('cinnamon', 1.0, 'tbs'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'tbs'), ('cream cheese', 4.0, 'oz'), ('butter', 0.25, 'cup'), ('powdered sugar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('vanilla extract', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('salt', 1.0, 'pinch')]"

Sprinkle the yeast over the top and set aside for 5 minutes, or until it becomes frothy on top and smells ""yeasty"". Very lightly butter the insides of two 9″ x 13″ pans, then set aside - Mom always prefers light-colored aluminum baking pans for this recipe., In a small pan over medium heat, melt shortening in 1 cup of hot water. Remove from heat and add 1 cup cold water., Add the water and shortening mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer, and then add the ¾ cup sugar, salt, and eggs, followed by the activated yeast mixture. With a dough hook attachment, mix these ingredients just until combined., Then add the flour, 1 cup at a time, mixing it in almost entirely each time before adding the next cup. When all flour has been incorporated, you will have a very soft dough that is easy to handle. At this point you can either use the dough right away or store the dough in the refrigerator for up to a week to make the rolls at a later time (see Notes section for details)., Cover the inside of a large bowl with a very light coating of oil. Place dough in the oiled bowl, turning it over to get some oil on all sides, so the top of the dough stays soft. Cover top of bowl with a clean kitchen towel and set in a warm place. Let dough rise to about double the original amount. This can take at least an hour, depending on the warmth of your surroundings, etc., For the Caramel, While the dough is rising, prepare the caramel. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, stir together brown sugar, cream, butter, corn syrup, and water until melted and combined. When it just starts to bubble (do not let it boil), remove the saucepan from the heat. It will have a cloudy appearance and will stay soft once the rolls are cooked. Divide the caramel between the two 9″ x 13″ pans, then set the pans aside to let the caramel cool while the dough continues to rise., To Assemble, Once the dough has doubled, score it in half. With a rolling pin, on a lightly floured surface, roll out each dough half into a large rectangle shape, about 14″ x 8″., Using the Cinnamon Sugar Filling ingredients, brush half of the melted butter over one dough rectangle. In a small bowl, stir together the granulated sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle half the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly over the melted butter on the dough rectangle. Starting with the wide side of the dough rectangle, roll the dough up tightly, and finish by pinching the seam to seal it. Cut the dough roll into 12 equal slices, using a sharp serrated knife or a piece of dental floss or thread. Place dough slices, cut-sides facing up, in one of the 9″ x 13″ pans with caramel in the bottom. Repeat with the other half of the dough, to create a second pan of rolls., Cover each pan with a clean kitchen towel and let dough rise again in a warm place, until dough has doubled in size. This can take at least an hour, depending on the warmth of your surroundings., Preheat oven to 350° F. Place pans in oven and bake for about 30 minutes, or until lightly browned. If you want to turn the rolls out onto a platter, let the rolls rest for 5-10 minutes after removing them from the oven before doing so. We usually just serve the rolls straight from the pan.

Pour it into the bowl of your stand mixer. Sprinkle yeast on top of the milk and whisk in. Wait 5-10 minutes until it begins to bubble or foam a bit, then, using the paddle attachment, at Medium-low speed, add the butter, sugar, salt, eggs and cardamom., At low speed, mix in the flour until incorporated, then remove the paddle attachment. Replace with dough hook. Knead at Medium to Medium-high speed until dough is elastic and still a bit sticky or “tacky”. This should take 5-7 minutes or so., Oil a large bowl, and form the dough into a ball. Place the dough in the bowl, cover with a cloth or plastic wrap and keep in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, about 1-2 hours, depending how warm your kitchen is. While the dough rises, make the filling, and prepare your pan(s) by lining with parchment, and coating with cooking spray or butter.

Set it aside to proof, about 5 minutes. A foam should develop on top, which will let you know that the yeast is good. (If no foam develops on top after 5 to 10 minutes, you might want to try a different batch.), In another separate bowl, combine the 3 tablespoons of psyllium husk with an additional ¾ cup of very hot water. Stir well, and set it aside. (The husk will thicken up significantly, forming a thick gel.), In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whisk well to mix the dry ingredients, then add in the egg, melted butter, and the yeast mixture, after the foam has developed on top. Add in the psyllium husk gel, and mix well, until the dough looks thick and relatively uniform., Place the bowl of dough in a warm place (like in an oven on a ""proof"" setting, or on a low-heat heating pad) to rise for 1 hour. The dough will not double in size, but it should expand., When the dough is finished rising, knead it in the bowl for 2 minutes. The underside of the dough will feel slightly sticky, so don't be surprised if it sticks to your fingers a bit. (Don't add more flour, though. You should be able to wipe the dough off the tips of your fingers and drop it back into the bowl.), Place a large piece of parchment paper on the counter, and set the dough in the center. Cover the dough with another large piece of parchment paper, so it won't stick to your rolling pin, then roll it out into a large rectangle, about 11 by 16 inches in size. (Roughly ⅛-inch thick.), Add the filling to the rectangle, leaving about a ½-inch at the top untouched, so it will be easy to seal the roll later. Spread on the melted butter first, then sprinkle the brown sugar and cinnamon evenly over that. Use the parchment paper under the dough to help roll it up into a long log, starting with the bottom (longest side) of the rectangle and moving your way up to the top. The parchment paper will prevent the dough from breaking as you roll. Once you reach the top, pinch the roll closed at the seam. Cut the log into 10 equal pieces., Prepare a 9-inch by 13-inch baking dish by spraying it with oil. Optional: Create a caramelized bottom by spreading 3 tablespoons of melted butter into the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of sugar over the butter, then arrange the cinnamon rolls on top of the sugar, in a single layer in the pan. The butter and sugar on the bottom will caramelize as the cinnamon rolls bake, creating a delicious bottom side to the rolls. Place the pan back in a warm spot to rise for 1 more hour. The cinnamon rolls should grow in size, but not necessarily double., Preheat the oven to 350ºF for at least 20 minutes in advance, so the oven comes to the proper temperature. When the cinnamon rolls are done with the second rise, place them in the preheated oven to bake for 25 minutes. Gluten-free rolls don't brown the same way gluten flour does, so they won't be golden brown, but they should feel dry to the touch and spread to fill the pan. Remove them from the oven and let them cool for at least 10 minutes while you mix the frosting together., To prepare the frosting, combine the melted butter, powdered sugar, vanilla, and water. Stir well, until the frosting looks smooth. You can add an additional teaspoon of water, if needed, to thin out the texture. Spread the frosting over the warm cinnamon rolls, then they are ready to serve.

Cover and set aside for a few minutes till dissolved and frothy., To make the dough, combine the milk, remaining sugar and butter in a large bowl. Mix well. A stand mixer with the dough hook is useful but this dough can also be mixed by hand with a little extra effort., Pour in the yeast mixture and beat for a few seconds. Now add 3 cups of flour as well as the salt, and let the mixer run on medium speed. Gradually add the remaining half cup of flour, a tablespoon at a time and continue beating. If you don't use the entire remaining amount, that's fine. You need a dough that is soft and smooth, with a bit of stickiness. The amount of extra flour you need will depend on how humid it is that day., If using a stand mixer, beat for 3 to 5 minutes after adding all the flour till the dough leaves the sides of the bowl and begins to form a ball. At this point I prefer to knead the dough with my hands. The dough should be soft, pliable, only slightly sticky and spring back slowly when poked with a finger and this is when you know it's ready to rise. Kneading entirely by hand may take a little longer but it's absolutely doable., Form the dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled, large bowl (I just use the mixing bowl itself). Cover with clingfilm and leave to rise in a warm area for 1 to 2 hours, until doubled. If your kitchen isn't very warm or you want to speed up the rise, turn your oven on to 100 C for a few minutes, switch it off, then place the bowl in it., In the meantime, prepare the apple mixture. Peel, core and finely chop the apples. Heat the butter in a non stick pan on low heat, then add the sugar and stir. Add the chopped apples and cinnamon and mix very well, cooking for 5 to 10 minutes until the apples are tender but not mushy, and the liquid is bubbling. Set aside to cool completely. Many recipes use raw chopped apples in the dough, but I really prefer doing it this way first, giving the apples a chance to soften and absorb more flavour from the cinnamon and butter, even if they release more liquid when cooked., When the dough has doubled in size (see photos below), lightly flour your kitchen counter or a silicone mat which is more convenient for clean up., Punch down the dough to release any air bubbles, then turn it out onto the floured mat. Pat into a 10x12 inch rectangle using your fingertips, ensuring it's the same thickness all over., Now make the cinnamon filling. In a small bowl, combine the cinnamon and sugar. Spread the butter onto the rectangle of dough, making sure it reaches every inch of it. It will seem like a lot of butter, but it's needed! Sprinkle on the cinnamon sugar, covering the dough entirely., Finally, spread the apple mixture onto the dough, pressing it down gently so it sticks to the dough. Make sure you leave the liquid behind in the pan, because the apples are already very moist., Slowly roll the dough up as tightly as possible, lightly flouring your fingertips as needed. The dough will be wet because of the apples, so this step will be a little messy but it'll come together in the end. Once rolled up, pat the ends to shape it properly and push any apples that may have fallen out, back in. Cut the dough into 9 equal pieces., Place each roll, cut-side up (so you can see the apples like in the photo below), in a lightly greased 8-inch square baking pan or line the pan with non-stick baking paper (I prefer this). It's ok if they stick to each other a bit. Cover with clingfilm and let rise again for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until puffy and roughly doubled in size., In the meantime, preheat the oven to 190 C. Take the clingfilm off the dish and bake the rolls for 25 to 30 minutes until browned on top, puffy and cooked through. If you find the rolls are browning too fast, lightly cover the top with foil and continue baking. Allow the rolls to cool at room temperature for about 20 minutes., To make the frosting, simply combine the cream cheese, sugar, milk and vanilla and mix well with a silicone spatula or whisk, till smooth and creamy. Spread the frosting on top of the rolls while they're still warm. Use a sharp knife to take each one out and dig in! If you really like your cinnamon rolls drenched in frosting, feel free to double the amount of frosting., Once fully cooled, you can store the rolls in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. You can even freeze them for longer. They reheat beautifully in the microwave!

Keep the additional flour (approx. 2 ounces or 35 grams) in a separate small bowl to be used, if necessary, for kneading and flouring your work surface. If you need more flour, use 1 tablespoon at a time, even if it’s used to flour the board. Keep notes, so when you make the dough again, you will know how much flour was used., Filling, 2 Tbs. ground cinnamon, 1 cup light brown sugar – firmly packed – about 215 grams, 4 Tbs. butter – melted and cooled, Butter or non-stick spray for greasing the pan or baking dish, Topping – Cream Cheese Frosting, 4 ounces cream cheese – softened – 113 grams, 4 Tbs. butter – softened –, 1 ½ cups powdered sugar – also known as confectioners’ sugar or icing sugar, 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract, Special Equipment:, Large glass baking dish or metal baking pan – I used a 10×15 inch glass baking dish, Instant read thermometer or candy thermometer – for accuracy – if you have one, Stand Mixer with paddle and dough hook OR By hand: large mixing bowl and sturdy spoon, Rolling pin, Pastry brush, Plastic wrap","Scald Milk: place the milk into a microwave safe cup and heat on high, stirring occasionally to ensure even heating. Once the milk is hot and steamy, begins to bubble slightly around the edges and starts to form a film or skin on the surface, the temperature should be between 180-190 degrees F, which is scalding. Remove from heat and then stir in the cold butter, salt and vanilla to combine. The cold butter will lower the temperature of the scalded milk, but the milk should still be warm when added to the flour. Set aside. Scalding can also be done on the stovetop in a small pot, over medium heat, stirring constantly. Immediately transfer the milk to a heat proof cup or glass measuring cup, before adding the butter. Do not heat the milk over too high a heat, as it will stick to the bottom of the pot and may scorch. Why scald the milk? At scalding temperatures some milk proteins unfold or lose their shape known as denaturing, which will result in a better dough rise and cinnamon rolls that are light and tender., Proof Yeast: Heat the water to 110-115 degrees F. Alternately use hot tap water, but that may be up to 120 degrees F, so allow it to cool to 110-115 F. Add 1 teaspoon of the sugar to the heated water and mix thoroughly with a fork. Pour in the yeast and mix with the fork until dissolved. Set aside for 5 to 10 minutes, until the mixture becomes very foamy. If foaming does not occur, you cannot proceed with the recipe, as the yeast may be bad or the water may not have been in the required range to activate the yeast; if it’s too cool and yeast does not activate, too hot and they die., Make Dough: If you do not have a stand mixer, the following steps can be done by hand using a large bowl with a sturdy spoon and your hands and work space for kneading the dough. Into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the flour and remaining sugar. Turn the mixer on and combine thoroughly. Add the activated yeast mixture to the flour and turn the mixer on low. Slowly pour in the warm milk and butter mixture. Add half of the whisked eggs and mixed thoroughly and then add the rest. Mix on low for about 2 minutes, until the mixture is thoroughly combined. At this point the dough will be very sticky. Scrape the dough off of the paddle and switch to the dough hook. (The next part can be done on the counter, kneading by hand, if you do not have a mixer, but may take longer than stated.) Knead with the dough hook for about 5 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and cleans away from the sides and the bottom of the bowl. At 5 minutes of kneading with the hook, if the dough is still very sticky, add 1 tablespoon of the reserved flour and continue kneading for another minute or two, until the dough absorbs the flour. Repeat if needed, but too much flour will make the rolls dry. If you are unsure, lightly flour your work surface with some of the reserved flour and knead the dough by hand for a minute or two to feel the texture. When it becomes smooth and elastic, you are done., Proof Dough – Dough Rise –: Grease a large bowl with non-stick spray or vegetable oil. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead slightly on a lightly floured work surface and form into a ball. Place the dough ball into the greased bowl and turn it over to thoroughly coat with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, leaving enough room for the dough to rise. Set the bowl in a warm place for 1-2 hours, until the dough has doubled in size. Do not allow the dough to rise too long, as it can make the rolls chewy. Be sure to place the bowl away from any drafts or air conditioning vents. I place it in the microwave where it’s out of the way, warm and cozy., Make Filling: In a bowl, thoroughly combine the brown sugar and cinnamon. I use my hands to be sure the brown sugar is completely broken up. Place the melted butter in a separate bowl. Grease the baking dish with butter or non-stick spray. Set aside., Roll Dough: Lightly flour work surface. Punch down the dough and then turn out onto floured work surface. Use your fingertips and press into the dough to help release the gases and begin to shape it into a lengthwise rectangle in front of you. Lightly flour a rolling pin and roll the dough into a 14×18 inch rectangle. I use a ruler to make sure it’s even., Add Filling: Use a pastry brush and brush the cooled melted butter over the surface of the dough, leaving a ½ inch border around the edges. You may not need all of the butter. Sprinkle the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture over the butter and spread evenly, leaving a ½ inch border of dough showing around the edges. Brush the edge of the dough closest to you with a little bit of water, which will aide in sealing the roll., Roll Dough into Log: Slowly roll the dough toward you to form a log. Do not roll it too tight or the centers of the rolls will pop up when rising and/or baking. Try to keep the sides of the log even as you roll. Press the moistened edge to seal the log. Trim the ends of the log with a serrated knife., Cut Dough into rolls: Using a sharp serrated edge knife, such as a bread knife, cut the roll in half in a gentle sawing motion, so the dough does not squish down. Then cut each half in half creating 4 pieces. Cut each piece into 3 pieces, creating 12 rolls total. Place each roll, cut side down into the prepared baking dish or pan., Proof Cinnamon Rolls – Second Dough Rising: Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap, leaving some room for the rolls to rise. Place the rolls in a warm area for about 1 hour or until they have doubled in size., Bake Cinnamon Rolls: Place oven rack in the center position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F, while the rolls rise, to allow the oven enough time to heat thoroughly. Bake the cinnamon rolls for about 23-28 minutes or until golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean. If you tap on the tops of the baked buns they should sound hollow. Set on a rack to cool for about 5 minutes, before adding the topping., Make Cream Cheese Frosting Topping: While the rolls bake, make the cream cheese frosting / glaze. Place the softened cream cheese into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or into a mixing bowl using a hand mixer. Beat the cream cheese for about a minute until smooth and creamy. Add the butter and beat until thoroughly combined and creamy. Add the vanilla extract and beat to combine. Add half of the powdered sugar and mix on low until combined and then add the rest. Mix for about 2 minutes until smooth and creamy. Spread the frosting over the tops of the warm cinnamon rolls. Remove rolls from pan, by cutting them apart., EAT Cinnamon Rolls!!!! Serve and enjoy! There are no words to describe these, so sounds will just have to do! Mmmm!!!! Enjoy! Di 😉, Note: The baked cinnamon rolls can be stored at room temperature for about 24 hours in an airtight container or refrigerated for about 3 days. I have reheated leftover rolls the next day in the microwave for about 10 seconds on high and they got their freshly baked texture right back. I don’t know what happens after 3 days, because they never last that long!

Set aside., In another bowl, combine lukewarm buttermilk and baking soda. If needed, warm the buttermilk in the microwave in 15-20 second intervals until warm to the touch, but not hot. Set aside., In a large bowl, add 2 Tablespoons sugar, vegetable oil, and egg, whisking until the egg is well beaten. Pour the buttermilk mixture into this bowl and stir, then add the yeast mixture and stir to combine., In another large mixing bowl, add 4 cups of flour and salt. Pour in the wet ingredients. Mix well using a wooden spoon or spatula. The mixture will be quite wet at this point (given that you weighed the flour properly; keep your method in mind). Add an additional ½ cup of flour, and another ½ cup if needed, to form a shaggy dough., Shaping the Dough, Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead the dough gently about 20 times, adding additional flour at about 1-2 tablespoons at a time as needed if it is overly sticky. The dough should be slightly sticky, soft, and elastic once you've finished kneading., Shape the dough somewhat into a ball and transfer to a bowl, covered with a tea towel, for 15-30 minutes until it's slightly risen. In the meantime, lightly grease a 9x13 glass baking dish and prepare the filling by melting the butter and combining the sugars and cinnamon in a separate bowl., Punch dough down and transfer it onto a floured cutting board or counter. Roll dough into large rectangular around 14x20 inches, with the long edge towards you., The Filling, Spread the melted butter on rolled out dough, leaving about 1/2 inch edge around the dough. A thin layer of butter should rest on top of the dough. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly across the dough, pressing gently into the butter., Begin rolling the dough into a log by starting at the long edge and rolling up in an even, tight row. Continue rolling, keeping the log somewhat tight, but not too tight, until it is in a full log., Use a serrated knife or unscented dental floss to slice into 1 1/2 inch pieces. Discard the small edges. Transfer sliced rolls to the prepared baking dish, placing them cut side up and leaving room between each roll for them to rise. Cover the pan with the tea towel and let the rolls rise in a warm environment (see note) for about 1 hour until they've doubled in size. If your house is cold or you've used too much flour, it could take up to an hour and a half., Baking: If the rolls seem to be progressing in their rise, begin preheating the oven to 350° F about 30 minutes into their rise. Once they're ready, bake for 17-20 minutes until the edges and tops are just slightly golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool slightly before frosting., Icing, Mix the Icing: In a bowl, combine powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla or maple flavoring (whichever you're using using). Mix to desired consistency. Spread the icing onto the slightly cooled rolls and enjoy!, Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.","[('yeast', 4.5, 'teaspoons'), ('water', 0.5, 'cup'), ('buttermilk', 1.5, 'cups'), ('soda', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('sugar', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('oil', 0.25, 'cup'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('flour', 4.0, 'cups'), ('salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('butter', 0.5, 'cup'), ('sugar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('sugar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('cinnamon', 3.0, 'teaspoons'), ('sugar', 2.0, 'cups'), ('milk', 1.0, 'tablespoons'), ('extract', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('extract', 0.5, 'teaspoon')]"

Place the pieces cut side up in the prepared dish and cover loosely with a kitchen towel. Let rise for 35 to 45 minutes. To check if they've risen enough, poke the side of a roll with your finger. If the indent stays and doesn't spring back, they're ready. Preheat your oven to 350℉ while the rolls rise. I place my rolls next to the oven on the counter. Note: The rise will likely take longer in the winter or if it's chilly in your house. I worked on these during the summer and it's air conditioned in our house, but still a bit warmer than in the winter months., Bake: Once the cinnamon rolls have risen, pour the heavy cream over and between them. Bake for 24-28 minutes, or until a cooking thermometer inserted into the center of one of the rolls registers 185℉. The tops of the rolls will have lightly browned. Prepare frosting while the rolls bake., Make the frosting: While the cinnamon rolls bake, prepare the frosting. Beat together all ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Mix on medium high until everything is combined and creamy. Thin the icing out a bit with more maple syrup or milk if desired. Don't beat it for as long if you want it thicker. (Cream cheese will become runnier the longer you mix it.), Serve + Store: Immediately frost the warm rolls, and enjoy! Store leftovers, covered, in the fridge for 2-3 days, reheating gently as desired. These are best fresh from the oven, naturally.","[('salted butter', 0.75, 'cup'), ('instant yeast', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('salt', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('real maple syrup', 0.25, 'cup'), ('water', 1.0, 'cup'), ('eggs', 4.0, None), ('all-purpose flour', 4.67, 'cups'), ('salted butter', 0.5, 'cup'), ('light brown sugar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('granulated sugar', 0.25, 'cup'), ('all-purpose flour', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('cinnamon', 1.5, 'tbsp'), ('nutmeg', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('salt', None), ('vanilla extract', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('heavy cream', 0.5, 'cup'), ('cream cheese', 6.0, 'ounces'), ('butter', 0.25, 'cup'), ('powdered sugar', 1.75, 'cup'), ('vanilla', 1.0, 'tsp')]"

Set aside until activated and foamy, about 5-10 minutes., To a large mixing bowl, add the 3 eggs. Whisk lightly., To the eggs, add the sugar and salt. Whisk together until blended. While continuing to whisk, pour in the melted coconut oil. Add the activated yeast and water mixture and whisk together to combine., Add 3 cups of flour and stir to blend well. The batter does not have to be completely smooth. Small lumps are okay., Add an additional 3 cups of flour and stir to incorporate all of the flour., Continue to add a little flour, maybe 1/4 - 1/2 cup, at a time to the mixture, stirring after each addition. Only add flour just until the dough starts to leave the side of the bowl and starts to lose its shiny ""wet"" appearance. The dough will become heavier and more difficult to stir. The dough will be somewhat slack, rough looking and sticky, but not gooey as it was with only 6 cups of flour. It may be difficult to stir and you may have to use your hands to incorporate the flour at the very end. Sometimes I can manage with a strong spoon and sometimes I cannot. (Please see Notes section about adding flour.), Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place to rise until double in bulk, about 1 hour, depending on the warmth of your kitchen. Alternately, the covered bowl can be placed in an oven with only the oven light turned on. (NO HEAT!). The light bulb warms the air in the oven., Punch dough down and let it rest in the bowl for 5-10 minutes. Divide dough in half. Leave one half in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Place the half on a lightly floured countertop. Gather the dough into a ball. Again, the dough will be slack, but will loosely hold the ball shape., Line the bottom a 9- x 13-inch baking dish or pan with parchment paper. (See Notes.) Butter the sides of the dish or pan well. Set aside. Note: If you do not have parchment paper, be sure to butter the bottom of the dish or pan well. As the cinnamon rolls bake, the filling tends to melt under the rolls and can cause sticking., Lightly sprinkle the top of the dough with flour. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a 16- x 12-inch rectangle. If the dough is resistant to being rolled out and shrinks back together, allow it to rest for 5-10 minutes and then proceed with rolling. Sprinkle a little flour on the top of the dough if it sticks to the rolling pin., For this step, the butter needs to be very soft. Spread the butter evenly over the dough, keeping an approximately 1-inch border of dough around the edges clear., In a small bowl, whisk together the brown sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle over the buttered dough, again avoiding the edges of the dough., Starting on one long edge, roll up the dough into a log shape. With a serrated knife or a 24- to 36-inch length of unflavored dental floss or string, cut the dough into twelve rolls., Place rolls, swirl side up, in the prepared baking dish, 3 across and 4 down. You may have to snuggle them together, but they will all fit. Repeat process with the remaining dough or reserve for another use. This dough can be refrigerated for up to five days. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise, about 45 minutes to one hour., Near the end of the rising time, preheat oven to 350-degrees F. Bake rolls until a light to medium golden brown, about 18-20 minutes. Remove from oven and place dish on a cooling rack., For the Frosting (This is enough for ONE pan of cinnamon rolls. Double the recipe for two pans.), While the rolls are cooling, make the frosting. In a medium bowl, beat the butter with a hand mixer for two minutes., Add the powder sugar. With the mixer on low, begin mixing the butter and powdered sugar together. As the two ingredients start to come together, increase the speed of the mixer and mix well., Add the vanilla and the heavy cream. Blend well. Begin adding the milk a tablespoon at a time, mixing after each addition. Continue adding the milk until the frosting is at a spreading consistency. In some cases it may take more than 1/4 cup of milk., Finishing, When the cinnamon rolls have cooled for about 10 minutes, spread a thin layer of the frosting over the top of the rolls. This will mostly melt into the rolls. Set the rest of the frosting aside until the rolls have almost completely cooled., Once the rolls are almost completely cool (the middle of the underside of the baking dish can still feel a little warm to the touch), frost the tops with the remaining frosting., Serve as desired.

Tips - Based on the type of yeast used, milk temperatures will vary. Red Star Platinum yeast calls for warmer temperatures than most, 120 to 130F; other brands and yeast call for much lower temperatures, about 95 to 105F. Warm milk according to manufacturer’s recommendations on the packaging. Taking the temperature with a digital thermometer is highly recommended, but if you’re not, make sure the milk is warm, not hot. Err on the cooler rather than hotter side so you don’t kill the yeast. If the milk separates or gets a little funny looking after being warmed, whisk it to smooth it out., To the dry ingredients in the stand mixer, add the melted butter, eggs, buttermilk, and beat on medium-low speed for about 1 minute, or until combined., Switch to the dough hook (the dough will have stuck to the paddle and just pick off what you can and put it into the bowl) and knead for 10 to 12 minutes (15 to 18 minutes by hand)., If after 5 minutes more flour is needed, add the remaining 1/4 cup flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough clears the side of the bowl but sticks to the bottom. Tips - This is a very sticky, tacky, moist, and borderline sloppy dough; don’t be tempted to over-flour it. It’s supposed to be that way. The more flour you add now, the less fluffy and more dense the rolls will be. Dough should clear the sides of the mixer while kneading but sticking to the bottom is fine. However, if the dough is simply too sloppy to work with, you can't move it from mixing bowl to rising bowl, it does need more flour so add some, as little as you can get away with, until you can work with the dough more easily., Remove the dough from the mixing bowl, spray a large mixing bowl with cooking spray, and place the dough in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and place it in a warm, draft-free place to rise for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours, or doubled in size. I keep my bowl inside a powered-off oven. Every 45 minutes or so, I power on the oven for 1 minute to 400F, as if I am preheating it, then I power it off. Do not, repeat not, keep the oven on. These short bursts of 1 minute of heat create a stable 85F-ish warm environment, ideal for the yeast. If your rising spot is cold, it will take longer than 2 1/2 hours., Prepare a 11-by-17-inch or similar sized jellyroll pan or sheetcake pan with a raised edge, or use a 9-by-13-inch pan. I prefer a jellyroll pan because it’s slightly larger so the rolls are less squished, have more room to rise, and bake more evenly. Line pan with aluminum foil, spray with cooking spray; set aside., Shape the Cinnamon Rolls, After dough has doubled in size, punch it down. Turn dough out onto a floured Silpat or floured countertop. Knead it lightly for about 2 minutes., With a rolling pin, roll it out to a 16-by-12-inch rectangle; just slightly larger than a standard Silpat., With a knife, butter the dough with 1/2 cup soft butter, leaving a 3/4-inch border around the edges., Sprinkle the brown sugar over it. Sprinkle the cinnamon over the brown sugar; I was very generous with the cinnamon and used almost 5 teaspoons and recommend at least 3; just eyeball it and shake it on., Evenly sprinkle the rainbow sprinkles., Loosen the dough from the counter using a bench scraper (or metal spatula), and starting with a long edge, roll the dough into a tight log. Pinch the seam closed and turn log so seam side is down., Gently stretch the log to be 18 inches in length with an even diameter all the way around and pat the ends to even them up. Don’t fret if your log isn’t perfect; it’s okay., Slice the cylinder into 12 evenly sized rolls (about 1 1/2 inches wide) using a bench scraper, serrated knife, or plain unwaxed dental floss (works great to not squish and compact the log)., Arrange the rolls cut side down in the prepared baking pan. Cover with plastic wrap., If making the rolls straight through: Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until the rolls have nearly doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours., If making the rolls overnight: Don’t let rolls rise after they’ve been sliced and placed in covered pan. Place pan in refrigerator for up to 16 hours. Before baking, let the rolls sit at room temperature until they have nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour., Bake the Rolls, For either version, bake at 350ºF for 22 to 25 minutes, or until lightly golden on top and cooked through but not overly browned., While the rolls cool, make the frosting., Make the Cream Cheese Frosting, To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine 1/2 cup butter, cream cheese, and beat on medium speed to combine, about 1 minute., Add the vanilla, 3 cups confectioners’ sugar (I don’t bother sifting), and beat until smooth and fluffy, about 3 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary., Add remaining 1 cup of sugar (or more, or None) as necessary, to taste, based on desired frosting consistency and flavor., Spread the frosting over the tops of the semi-cooled rolls. Tips - Make sure they're not too warm or the frosting will melt. You may not use all the frosting if you don't like a lot of frosting on your rolls. That's fine, you don't need to use it all. Extra frosting will keep airtight in the fridge for many weeks or you can freeze it., Evenly sprinkle the rainbow sprinkles over the top and serve the rolls.","[('all-purpose flour', 4.0, 'cups'), ('granulated sugar', 0.333, 'cup'), ('instant dry yeast', 2.25, 'teaspoons'), ('salt', None, None), ('unsalted butter', 6.0, 'tablespoons'), ('eggs', 3.0, None), ('buttermilk', 0.75, 'cup'), ('light brown sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('cinnamon', 4.0, 'teaspoons'), ('rainbow sprinkles', 0.5, 'cup'), ('cream cheese', 6.0, 'ounces'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('confectioners’ sugar', 1.0, 'pound'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon')]"

Flour will hold more or less water depending on the humidity and temperature of your kitchen. ), Remove dough to a large greased bowl ( cooking spray) covered with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place until doubled in size. About 1 hour. ( again, the amount of time needed to get the dough to double depends on your kitchen. I like to turn my oven on and preheat it to 400, then turn it off. I then place my bowl of dough on TOP of the oven, where the surface is now warm...this helps me to achieve a good rise, even when my kitchen is cool. ), After dough has risen, punch it down, and roll out on a greased surface ( cooking spray works well ) Roll out to a 16"" x 12"" rectangle. Combine the filling ingredients in a small bowl. Brush the surface of the rectangle with the skim milk. Sprinkle evenly with the sugar, brown sugar, flour mixture.

Turn on the dough hook and knead for a few minutes. Add the remainder of the bread flour as needed. The dough should be tacky, not overly sticky and should all cling to one side of the bowl (or away from the edges depending on your mixer). Knead for a total of 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth., Bulk Fermentation: Put the dough in a container and cover. Set the dough in a warm, 76-78 degree F place for 4 hours. Take the temperature of the dough as needed to make sure the dough temperature is right around 78 degrees F.

If it doesn't feel this way, let it bulk ferment for another half hour and check again., Overnight Option: At this point, after the bulk fermentation has finished, you can cover the dough and put it in the refrigerator. Proceed with the recipe the next day, shaping and proofing the rolls before baking. This allows you to time the red velvet rolls for breakfast or brunch if desired., Mix up the Filling: Near the end of bulk fermentation, mix up the red velvet roll filling.

Use a pie plate, fitting 4 rolls per pie plate for a beautiful circular shape. You could also use a 9 by 13 pan and put all the rolls in the pan. I've also crammed all 8 rolls in a large pie tin if you want a fuller look (but it will take longer to bake). Choose your pan and spray with cooking spray., Shaping: Roll the dough out in a 16 by 10 inch rectangle. Spread the filling over the dough. Sprinkle chocolate chips over the filling. Roll the red velvet rolls up, cinnamon-roll-style, starting at the edge closest to you and rolling tightly. Pinch the seam closed and flip seam-side down., Cut the log of dough into 12 equal pieces. Place each red velvet roll in the pan, nestling them together. You can also bake these on a baking sheet, spread out a little, if desired (they will take less time if they aren't nestled together, so watch carefully)., Proofing: Cover the pan and let rise in a 78 degree F place until puffed up and risen, about 3 hours. Do not bake these rolls if they have not risen., Baking: Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees F. For rolls that are 4 to a pan, bake for about 30-35 minutes until baked all the way through. For rolls 8 to a pan, bake a little longer, 40-45 minutes. For rolls baked on a baking sheet and not touching, bake for about 20-25 minutes., Cream Cheese Frosting: Using a hand mixer, whip together softened butter and cream cheese. Add the powdered sugar, vanilla extract and heavy whipping cream and salt. Whip together for 2-3 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.

(1 pound, weight) powdered sugar, 3-5 Tbs. half and half (depending on desired icing texture), 3 Tbs. unsalted butter, melted, 4 oz. cream cheese, softened, Caviar from one vanilla bean (see dough)","For the Dough:, Before applying heat—pour the milk, half and half, canola oil, and sugar into a Dutch oven, whisking to combine., Slice a vanilla bean open lengthwise. Scrape the interior “caviar” from the vanilla bean and place it in an airtight container for later use in the icing. Take the now empty vanilla bean hull and float it in the milk mixture., Heat the milk mixture over medium heat until it begins to simmer and bubble around the edges, whisking occasionally. (Do not allow the mixture to come to a rapid boil.), Turn off the heat, remove the vanilla bean hull, and allow to cool to lukewarm (warm, but not hot to the touch.), Once mixture has cooled to lukewarm, sift the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda over top. Sprinkle the yeast over everything, and stir with a wooden spoon until blended. Dough will be very sticky., Cover the Dutch oven with a clean towel, and allow mixture to rise until it doubles in bulk--about 2 hours. After the initial rise, place a lid on the pot, and refrigerate 2 hours or overnight. The dough is quite sticky, and will be easier to work with after being refrigerated. Refrigeration also slows the yeast, still allowing the dough to rise. At this point, I usually take the butter for the filling, and the cream cheese for the icing out of the ‘fridge and set it on the counter so that it is ready to use in the morning. (You do what you are comfortable with.), The next morning, take the dough out of the refrigerator, and allow it to stand at room temperature while you prepare the filling and icing., For the Filling:, In a small bowl, combine the softened butter, ground cinnamon, granulated sugar, and salt with an electric mixer until thoroughly blended; set aside to prepare the icing., For the Icing:, In a medium bowl, combine the powdered sugar, softened cream cheese, half and half, and melted butter until combined. Add the reserved caviar from the vanilla bean, and continue mixing until the bean flecks are distributed throughout. Add more half and half, as needed, until the icing is thick but still pourable., Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set it aside while assembling the cinnamon rolls., To Assemble the Cinnamon Rolls:, Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F., Grease two 13x9x2 baking pans with butter or baking spray; set aside. (I normally use about a tablespoon of cold butter to grease both baking dishes. I, however, do not recommend using dark and/or nonstick pans as they cook the outside of the rolls too quickly, darkening/crisping the outsides before the centers are done.), Turn the dough out onto a clean, well floured work surface. Have a bench scraper handy, if you have one. If not, a thin spatula will do., Lightly flour the top of the dough, and roll it evenly into a 24” x 8” rectangle. Dough will be about ¼ inch thick. If at any time the dough sticks to the rolling pin, sprinkle the dough with a little more flour., Use an offset spatula to spread the filling over the dough to within 1/2 inch of the edges., Beginning with the long side farthest from you, tightly roll the dough over the filling towards yourself. Take your time to roll it tight—we don’t want any loosey-goosey cinnamon rolls! If at any point the dough is sticking to the work surface, gently run a thin bench scraper under it to loosen without tearing the dough., Once the dough has been rolled, pinch the edges and seams together., Use a sharp or serrated knife to cut the roll into 1 inch pieces. Place the pieces (cut side up) into the prepared pans, about an inch or so apart. I usually place 3 rolls in row, with 4 rows of rolls per baking dish., Once all the rolls are cut and nestled in their pans, allow them to rest for about 10 minutes., Bake the cinnamon rolls for 16-18 minutes, or until they are lightly golden brown around the edges, and the centers are set, but not very brown., Remove cinnamon rolls from the oven to cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes., After 10 minutes, pour the icing over the cinnamon rolls—you will have more than enough icing to cover 24 rolls. Pouring the icing while the rolls are still warm will allow it to seep into the creases of the rolls. Use an offset spatula to spread the icing to cover every exposed area of the cinnamon rolls., Allow rolls to cool for another 10 minutes, if you desire to serve them warm; or allow the rolls to cool completely before serving., Store leftover cinnamon rolls tightly wrapped at room temperature for up to 2 days.","[('milk', 1.5, 'c'), ('half and half', 0.5, 'c'), ('sugar', 0.5, 'c'), ('oil', 0.5, 'c'), ('vanilla bean', 1.0, ''), ('flour', 4.5, 'c'), ('salt', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('baking powder', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('baking soda', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('yeast', 2.25, 'tsp'), ('butter', 1.0, 'c'), ('cinnamon', 1.5, 'tbs'), ('sugar', 0.75, 'c'), ('salt', 0.125, 'tsp'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'c'), ('half and half', 0.3125, 'c'), ('butter', 3.0, 'tbs'), ('cream cheese', 4.0, 'oz'), ('vanilla bean', 1.0, '')]"

If you dip your finger in it shouldn't be hot at all, only warm., In a medium or large mixing bowl combine flour, sugar, and salt., Once the milk is warm, transfer it to another container so that milk doesn't to heat up. Add the yeast and let sit for at least 5 minutes for the yeast to activate. Once activated, add milk + yeast to the flour mixture. Combine with a fork and your hands. Knead dough for about 5 minutes until no longer sticky. Form into a ball and cover with a lid or clean cheese cloth/towel and let rise for about 45 minutes until double in size., Make the Filling, In a medium bowl cream together room temp butter and sugar. Add molasses, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves and mix with a fork. You can put the mixture in the fridge until you're ready to use it, but make sure that it's out at room temp beforehand to make sure you can spread it easily., Make the Frosting, Blend white sugar until a fine powder similar to powdered sugar (or use powdered sugar). In a medium-sized bowl cream together the butter and sugar. Add the cream cheese and mix. Don't overly whip or the cream cheese could thin out more than you want. Add vanilla and almond extracts, and start with 4 tbsp milk. Add 1 tbsp milk to thin to a preferred consistency.

Pat dough ball into a slightly rectangle shape, which will help you maintain the rectangle shape as you stretch out the dough. I prefer to work out the dough using my hands to avoid loosing air, but you can use a rolling pin if you prefer., Roll out dough into a rectangle approximately 12"" x 17."" Spread filling over dough. I like to go right to the edges but leaving about a 1/2"" space on the long side furthest from you for when rolling the dough., Starting at the long edge closest to you, roll dough into a log. Cut log in half, then each piece in half again. Cut each of those sections into equal thirds. Make sure your knife is sharp so you're not squishing the dough too much. *Option to use floss (plain, not flavored) to tie around log and pull tight to cut into sections., Lightly grease a cake pan (11"" x 7""). Place rolls in cake pan making 4 rows of 3. Try to space them out so they're not touching the sides of the pan or each other if possible. Cover with a cheesecloth or towel and let rise for about 10-15 minutes., Bake, Bake rolls at 375℉ for 25 minutes. Remove and set on a cooling rack. Option to frost while warm, wait until about 15 minutes before frosting, or wait until rolls are completely cool. I like to wait a bit so they're still a little warm but not as fragile. There is quite a bit of frosting for this recipe. Above in the narrative I've included the portions for a smaller batch of frosting. You can use all the frosting to cover the rolls, or cover the rolls with the amount of your choosing and save the remaining frosting for people to individually add more if they want., Store in your fridge., Reheating, Reheat rolls at 300℉ for about 8 minutes or use microwave for just a few seconds.

Don't knead the dough to develop any gluten. Once it is homogenous, set it aside., Roll out the dough on a floured work surface into a rectangle. The dough sheet should be about 1/2-inch (1-1.5 cm) thick. Flour another part of your work surface and roll out the butter into a square that is a little smaller than the short side of your rectangle.

Dough should be soft and a little sticky, but still manageable to knead with lightly floured hands., Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st Rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter. Takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), Grease a 9×13 inch baking pan or two 9-inch square or round baking pans. You can also bake the rolls in a cast iron skillet or on a lined baking sheet.*, Shape the rolls, When the dough is ready, punch it down to release the air. Divide the dough into 14-16 equal pieces. (Just eyeball it– doesn’t need to be perfect!) A bench scraper is always helpful for cutting dough. Shape each piece into a smooth ball. Arrange in prepared baking pan., 2nd Rise:, Cover shaped rolls with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow to rise until puffy, about 1 hour., Adjust oven rack to a lower position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). (It’s best to bake the rolls towards the bottom of the oven so the tops don’t burn.), Bake the rolls, Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown on top, rotating the pan halfway through. If you notice the tops browning too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil. Remove from the oven, brush with optional honey butter topping, and allow rolls to cool for a few minutes before serving., Cover leftover rolls tightly and store at room temperature for 2-3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.","[('whole milk', 1.0, 'cup'), ('instant yeast', 2.25, 'teaspoons'), ('granulated sugar', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('unsalted butter', 0.25, 'cup'), ('salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('all-purpose flour', 3.0, 'cups'), ('unsalted butter', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('honey', 1.0, 'tablespoon')]"

Combine both sugars, cinnamon, and allspice in a bowl with a pinch of salt (optional) and set aside., assembly, Divide the dough into quarters (use a kitchen scale to be precise) and shape each section into a smooth ball. Lightly flatten the dough against the counter then fold and tuck the edges up over the center of the dough creating a smooth surface against the counter. Then flip the dough balls over so the smooth side is facing up. Work with one dough ball at a time, leaving the others covered while you work so they don't dry out., Roll one piece of dough into a large oval-y circle-ish shape on a lightly floured surface. Rotate the disc of dough as you roll to ensure it isn't sticking. When the dough is about 11-12"" wide and very, very thin (almost translucent) you're ready for the next step., Brush any excess flour off the dough. Then, use a small offset spatula or small silicone spatula with a flexible tip to spread a very thin layer of softened brown butter across the surface of the dough all the way to the edges. Be careful not to rip or tear the dough., Sprinkle on a quarter of the cinnamon sugar mixture. You want a somewhat uneven application here — try to avoid big clumps, but it's okay if it's splotchy or slightly bare in a few spots. Then top with a tablespoon or two of the toasted walnuts. Less is more here!, Roll the dough circle up into a tightly coiled log tube. Pinch both ends of the tube shut. Then, coil the log tube into a tight spiral, tucking the open end underneath.

While the oil heats up, gently roll the pancakes into ½"" thick discs about 6"" wide, starting with the one that has rested the longest. Some walnuts and cinnamon sugar might break through the dough — that's okay., Test oil by dipping the edge of a pancake in it. It's ready if it immediately starts to bubble. Place the pancake in the oil slowly, bent at almost a right angle as you slide it in. This helps ensure the center of the pancake hits the oil as evenly as the edges, and that you don't end up with an air pocket under the center of the pancake. Fry each pancake 2-3 minutes per side, then remove to a cooling rack over a sheet pan lined with paper towels.

Sift over the remaining 150g plain flour in a thick layer, then leave for 15–20 minutes until you can see the flour beginning to crack as the yeast works underneath it., Add the 640g bread flour, the 95g soft butter, sugar, salt and milk, then knead using the dough hook on a slow speed for 5 minutes until you have a soft but not completely smooth dough., Tip the dough onto a clean worktop and knead by hand for a few minutes, forming it into a ball. Lightly flour the surface and rolling pin, then roll the dough out to a 20cm x 30cm x 5cm thick rectangle. Transfer to the lined baking sheet, wrap well, then freeze for 30 minutes (see tips)., While the dough chills, take the 400g butter out of the fridge and leave it to warm up for 15 minutes. Put in a sandwich bag or between 2 pieces of cling film, then press it down to create an even rectangle, about 15cm x 20cm and 1.5cm thick. Chill until the dough is ready (see tips)., Roll the chilled dough into a 15cm x 60cm rectangle. Flour your biggest worktop and put the dough in front of you, short edges at the sides. Put the chilled butter in the centre of the dough, then fold each short edge over to encase the butter., Press the dough out with the rolling pin, working away from you, front to back only, not side to side – the direction you roll in is crucial to maintain even layers. Roll out a rectangle that’s 1cm thick by 1 metre long., Imagine dividing the dough into thirds. Fold the bottom third up, then the top third down over that to give 3 layers, like folding a letter. Put the folded dough back on the baking sheet, re-wrap and freeze for another 30 minutes., Remove the dough from the freezer, unwrap it and sit the dough in front of you exactly as it was before, like a folded letter. Give it a quarter turn so the long edges are now horizontal. Roll out again on the floured worktop, away from you, to make a rectangle 1cm thick by 1 metre long. Fold the bottom edge up to meet the centre line of the dough and fold the top edge down so the two edges meet. Finally, fold the dough back down in half to create 4 layers. Return to the baking sheet, wrap, then freeze for 30 minutes more., For the filling, mix the muscovado sugar, caster sugar and cinnamon and set aside., Put the dough on the floured worktop, give it a quarter turn, then roll out to a 30cm x 80cm rectangle, 1-2cm thick. Give the rolled dough another quarter turn so the short edges are at the sides., Brush the dough with melted butter, leaving a thin border along the top edge. Sprinkle the filling all over the melted butter and pat it down so it just begins to dissolve into the dough. Using a palette knife, squash the long edge furthest away from you to the work surface to hold the pastry in place as you roll (see tips)., Starting from the long edge closest to you, roll the dough up tightly like a swiss roll. Turn it seam-side down then, with a sharp non-serrated knife, cut the dough in half. Put the two pieces side-by-side and cut them both into 9 equal-size buns (see tips). Take each bun and tug out the loose end of the rolled dough to stretch it slightly, then tuck it under itself so the bun sits on it (see tips and Make Ahead). Transfer the buns to the muffin tins., Put the tins in a cold oven for 2 hours to prove, with a small bowl of hot water on the floor of the oven, until risen and springy to the touch. Remove from the oven (along with the bowl of water)., Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Put the trays in the oven, then immediately reduce the temperature to 180°C/160°C fan/gas 4. Bake for 25–30 minutes until completely puffed up and the buns have spilled out of the muffin holes. They should be a dark, golden brown colour., Remove from the oven and set aside for 5 minutes, then carefully lift out of the tin and rest back on the tins (slightly askew) to cool further – don’t let the base of each bun touch the muffin tray or they’ll stick as the sugar solidifies., For the topping, mix the sugar and cinnamon in a large shallow bowl then, once the buns have completely cooled, roll them gently in the topping to coat.

I recommend placing a piece of parchment paper down, then flouring it, putting the puff pastry, and using another sheet on top of that., Roll out puff pastry until it forms roughly a 10x10 inch square. You can use a ruler if it helps or else you can eyeball it!, Melt Vegan Butter and brush the puff pastry with it., Now, using a spoon or your clean hands, sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar mixture over the puff pastry. Leave about a 1-inch border to make rolling up the vegan cinnamon rolls easier and to help the puff pastry stick together. I personally like using my hands for this part as I can spread it more evenly!, To roll up the puff pastry, start at the bottom of the square or the part that is closest to you. Roll away from you in a tight roll like you are rolling a blanket or a sleeping bag. Once you have rolled it all the way up, cut off a little bit of dough from either end so you have a clean edge., When cutting puff pastry, cut up and down in a ""chop"" motion, DO NOT CUT BACK AND FORTH! Cutting back and forth in a sawing motion will ruin the puff pastry. Cut like you would a carrot, not a piece of bread!, Once the puff pastry is rolled up, it is time to cut it. Place the seam side down. I recommend using a little bit of water to ""seal"" the seam before cutting as this will help it stick. You will cut this log into 8 even pieces. Start in the middle and cut into two pieces. Then in the middle of each piece and cut 4 pieces. Then in the middle of the 4 pieces to cut 8 pieces. This is a super easy method to cut even pieces for the cinnamon rolls., Lay the cinnamon buns ""roll"" side up on a parchment-lined sheet about 1-2 inches from each other. I prefer this method as this gives you individual buns that don't stick together. If you prefer your buns to stick together, you can bake them 1/2 inch apart in a casserole dish., Bake for 20 minutes or until the puff pastry is golden brown. Once cooked, take out and let cool for 10 minutes before glazing. If you glaze while they are hot, the glaze will melt into the vegan cinnamon rolls and it won't stay on the surface like in the photos., To make the glaze, simply add powdered sugar, vanilla, and non-dairy milk to a bowl and mix together until a liquid is formed. You can make the glaze thicker by adding a little more powdered sugar or thinner by adding milk in 1 teaspoon increments.

Place in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until frozen solid., In a large bowl, whisk together flour, salt, sugar, and yeast to combine.* Note: If you're not sure if your yeast is good to use, you can test if it's alive by mixing it into the water instead and letting it sit for 5 to 10 minutes. It should foam and bubble, otherwise the yeast is not useable., Add the frozen butter to the dry ingredients and gently toss to combine. Try to keep the butter pieces as intact as you can., Add in your water and milk, and mix together until you have a shaggy dough. Don't knead or mix too much! It can break up the butter and create a less flaky final product., Cover the dough and place in the fridge for at least 2 hours or up to 24. The dough should puff up slightly and look a little less shaggy. I personally prefer to leave it overnight., Laminate the croissant dough: Take the chilled dough out of the fridge and turn onto a large floured piece of parchment paper. Stretch the dough out into a rough rectangle that's about 10x6 inches large. You can do this with your hands or a rolling pin. Add flour if it's sticking too much to your hands or rolling pin., Working from the 6 inch side, tightly roll the dough up into a log. Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat the stretching and rolling process once more. If the butter starts to feel soft or the dough starts to shrink in on itself, transfer the parchment paper and dough onto a cookie sheet and loosely cover it with plastic wrap. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes or until the butter is firm again and the dough has relaxed enough to roll., Once the dough has been laminated twice, cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 1 hour or up to 24 hours., Shape the rolls: Lightly flour the chilled dough and roll into a 15x10 inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over top leaving about a 1/2 inch boarder along the edges., In a medium bowl, mix together sugar and cinnamon to combine. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar evenly over the buttered dough., Starting from the 15 inch side, roll the dough up tightly into a tube. Cut the ends off the log, and then cut 12 equal rolls using a sharp serrated knife or unscented dental floss., Line the bottom and sides of a 9x13 inch baking dish with parchment paper (for easier cleanup!)

Or if using our easier dough recipe, you can begin the same day!, The next day, continue the steps to laminate the dough from the danish pastry dough recipe., While the dough is resting between folds, make your filling by combining softened butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt and stir together until you get a smooth paste., Once you have completed all the laminations according to the danish pastry dough recipe up to the shaping part and the dough has rested, roll out half of your dough into a flat rectangle that is about 1/4″ thick. By starting with half, it is a lot easier to work with. Trim off the edges if needed to make an even rectangle., Spread half of the remonce over the dough, making sure to spread it out in an even layer., Roll it up into a log, starting from the shorter end of the rectangle. This will give your rolls more of a swirl., Then, cut into either 6 or 8 pastries, depending on how thick you want them to be (it really doesn't matter!)., Place this first batch on a baking sheet and cover to let them start proofing. Then repeat these steps with the second half of the dough, using up the second half of the remonce., Leave your shaped pastries to rise for at least 2 hours, perhaps longer (we have waited up to three and a half hours for this step!). This is a very important step, because under-proofing these means major butter leakage (we are speaking from experience!) You’ll know the pastries are ready when they feel super light and airy (almost wobbly when you touch them) and have doubled in size. Another test is to poke the dough, and if it leaves an impression and doesn’t spring back immediately, it should be ready., Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 375 degrees F (190 C)., Once your pastries have risen, egg wash them. You can then either sprinkle them with some turbinado/pearl sugar or leave them with just the egg wash., Bake for about 15 minutes or until golden brown. You can either bake both baking sheets at the same time if you adjust the oven racks, or bake one at a time on a center oven rack. Baking one at a time will help ensure even baking if your oven tends to have uneven heat on the upper and lower racks., Combine powdered sugar and water/milk until you reach your desired icing consistency.

When the dough has come together in a shaggy ball (this may take slightly more or less flour—err on the side of a slightly sticky dough to keep it from being tough), pour in the olive oil in a drizzle as the dough hook keeps stirring., On a medium-low speed, let the dough knead for 4 to 5 minutes.

Combine the cup of sugar with the orange zest. Allow to sit for a couple of minutes while the zest releases its oil into the sugar. Then, rub it together until well mixed and slightly moist. Next combine the orange and lemon juice and stir it into the sugar a bit at a time until you have a thick mixture about the consistency of wet sand (you may not use all of the juice). Set aside., Butter a 9- by 13-inch baking pan. When the dough had risen, punch it down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.

Then fit the slices into the buttered pan, with the pinched sides down and the un-pinched cut sides up. Cover and allow to rise for another 45 minutes to an hour, until puffed. You can also put the rolls in the refrigerator at this point and let them slow rise over night and bake them in the morning.

Stir the mixture gently with a fork just until all the yeast is moistened and then set the yeast mixture aside for 3-5 minutes., Into a separate bowl, measure the flour, sea salt, cinnamon and nutmeg and mix them together with a wire whisk until they're combined., Once you've noticed the yeast has begun to grow, add the pumpkin puree, the egg, the 1/4 cup sugar, and the melted butter to the yeast mixture. Dump the dry ingredients into the bowl of the mixer as well, right over top of the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer on low and let the dough hook go to work combining the ingredients and forming a soft, sticky dough. Once the dough begins to form increase the speed just slightly and let the machine knead the dough for about 5 minutes. It's a good idea to keep an extra 1/4 cup of flour on hand, just in case your dough is a little too sticky and you need to add a little here or there to keep the dough together., Remove the dough hook and form the dough into a ball with your hands, returning it to the bowl of the stand mixer and covering the bowl with plastic wrap. Place the dough in a warm, dry place in your kitchen and let the dough rise for 90 minutes or until it has more than doubled in bulk., Roll the dough out on a floured surface into a large square, about 18 inches by 18 inches., Combine the filling ingredients (sugar and spices) in a small bowl and spread the filling evenly over the surface of the dough. Starting with the end closest to you and rolling away from you, roll the dough up gently and as tightly as you can, creating a spiral pattern on the inside. Slice the log you've created into 8 rolls that are equal in size., Grease a round cake pan with some butter., Drizzle the maple syrup into the bottom of the greased pan and arrange the 8 rolls in the cake pan. Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap to get the rolls ready for their last rise., Now here's the best part about this recipe: you can easily turn it into an ""overnight"" recipe by completing all the steps up to this point in the evening and placing the rolls in the fridge to complete their last rise while you get your beauty sleep. The cool temperature of the fridge retards the yeast so it rises very slowly all night long. When you wake up in the morning, set your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and place the rolls in the COLD oven (plastic wrap removed, of course). Because the rolls have been in the cold refrigerator all night they'll complete the last bit of their rise in the oven as the oven heats up. Once the oven reaches 350 degrees, set the timer for 25-30 minutes and the rolls will be perfectly done after that time., Alternatively, if you'd rather get the whole recipe over with in one day, feel free to let the rolls rise at room temperature for another 30 minutes after you've placed them in the greased pan. Be sure to cover them with plastic wrap while they complete this last rise, and remove the plastic wrap before placing them in the oven that's been preheated to 350 degrees. The baking time is the same - 25-30 minutes at 350 degrees. The only difference is that you'll wait to put the rolls in the oven until the oven has reached the correct temperature rather than placing the rolls in the cold oven., While you're waiting for the rolls to cool, add the softened cream cheese and the powdered sugar to a mixing bowl and cream them together with a rubber spatula. Once the mixture is creamy and smooth, add the milk a few teaspoons at a time until the glaze has reached a consistency that's somewhere between spreadable and drizzle-able (and now I'm making up words...). Once the rolls have cooled almost completely (it's okay if they're still a bit warm), pour the glaze over the top of the rolls and spread it around evenly with a rubber spatula.

Sprinkle the active dry yeast evenly across the top of the mixture, stir gently, and let it sit for about 10 minutes., Add the flour and mix until a dough forms. If using gluten free flour, add the non dairy yogurt to the dough and use your hands to work it into the dough. This makes the gluten free dough more elastic so that it holds together better while rolling. If you are using regular all purpose flour, you don't need to add yogurt to your dough., Form the dough into a round mound and cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel. Allow it to sit for an hour. I like to sit my bowl on top of an oven preheated to 350. The warmth from the oven helps the dough rise faster. Note, if using gluten free all purpose flour, the dough will not rise as much., While waiting on the dough to rise, prepare the maple glaze by mixing the maple syrup, melted butter, and vanilla together. If you'd like a more traditional frosting style glaze, add the powdered sugar and whisk. Set the glaze aside., After the dough has risen for an hour, place it on a floured surface, roll the dough into a 1/4 inch oval or rectangle (add more flour if the dough is too sticky to roll). Note, if using gluten-free flour, the dough will be slightly more dry. Spread the softened butter to cover the dough. Top with the brown sugar and cinnamon., Preheat the oven to 350, Roll the dough into a log and cut it into about 10 pinwheels. Place the pinwheels into a round, square, or rectangle baking dish so that they are close but not touching. Cover them with a towel or loose plastic wrap and set aside for another 30 minutes. Note, if your rolls are gluten free, they won't be as voluminous as rolls with gluten in them, but they'll be every bit as delicious!, After allowing the rolls to rise, bake them in the oven for 30-35 minutes until they are golden on top. While the rolls are baking, use a mixer or whisk to mix the maple glaze ingredients together. Allow the rolls to cool and pour the glaze over top. Enjoy!, Quick No-Yeast Maple Cinnamon Rolls Option (30 Minutes), Preheat the oven to 400, Mix 3/4 cup almond milk, 1/2 cup melted vegan butter, and 1 1/2 tsp baking powder together. Then, add the 2 cups of regular or gluten free all purpose flour together and mix until a thick dough forms. If using gluten free flour, use your hands to work the non dairy yogurt into the dough to help it hold together better while rolling., Place the dough onto a floured surface and sprinkle the top with more flour. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough into a 1/4 inch thick slab. Spread with softened vegan butter, sprinkle with brown sugar, and cinnamon., Carefully roll the dough into a log. Slice the log into 10-12 pinwheels and place them into a greased round dish. Bake the cinnamon rolls for about 20 minutes.

Heat the milk in the microwave or stovetop until it’s lukewarm, between 120F and 130F. Pour the milk into a large mixing bowl and sprinkle the dry yeast over the top. Allow the yeast and milk to stand for 5 minutes, then whisk the two together., Add the sugar, salt, cinnamon, butter, eggs, vanilla, and pumpkin puree. Whisk for a few minutes until a uniform mixture forms., Gradually begin to add the flour, adding about ½ cup at a time. Whisk the flour into the batter at first, then switch to a spatula as a soft dough forms., Once a dough ball begins to take shape, lightly flour your work surface and turn the dough out onto the work surface. Continue to add the flour, about 5 cups in total (reserve approximately ½ cup for dusting the surface), until the dough is very soft but not sticky. Knead the dough for 4 to 5 minutes, until it’s smooth and elastic., Place the dough into a large mixing bowl, cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and place the dough into a warm corner of your kitchen, away from any drafts. Allow the dough to proof for 1 to 1 ½ hours, until it’s doubled in size., Making the Pumpkin Filling:, For the filling, place the softened butter into a mixing bowl. Use a mixer to beat the butter for a few minutes until it's smooth and creamy., Add the brown sugar, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and vanilla next. Beat everything together until a uniform mixture forms., Assembling the Pumpkin Cinnamon Rolls:, Line a 9x13-inch casserole pan with parchment paper., Once the dough has doubled, punch it down and turn out onto a well floured work surface. Using a well-floured rolling pin, roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 20x20-inches (40x48-cm) in size., Spread the prepared pumpkin spice filling over the dough using an off-set spatula. Use a sharp knife to cut the sheet of dough into 12 equal sized strips. I usually start in the middle, then cut the sheet into quarters, then cut down further., Gently roll each strip of dough into a roll without squeezing out the filling. Transfer the rolls into the prepared casserole pan. Allow the shaped rolls to proof for about 30 to 45 minutes, or until doubled in size., Baking Instructions:, Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350F/177C. Once the rolls have proofed, bake them for 10 minutes. At the 10 minute mark, remove the rolls from the oven and evenly pour the cream or milk over the top of the rolls. This will prevent the dough from drying out., Return the rolls to the oven and continue baking them for another 22 to 25 minutes, or until the rolls are a rich, golden brown color on top., Cream Cheese Icing:, While the rolls are baking, prepare the cream cheese icing. Place the softened cream cheese into a small mixing bowl and whisk it for a few minutes until it’s smooth and creamy. Add the confectioner’s sugar, vanilla, and salt. Whisk again for about 1 minute, until the icing is smooth., Once the rolls are done, let them cool for a few minutes, then spread about two-thirds of the icing over the rolls. Reserve the remaining icing to serve individually.

Spread on top of the dough., 6- Cut the dough in half, leaving two approximately equal squares of dough. Slowly roll the dough from one end to the other so that the crumble mixture is spiraled inside itself. Repeat for the other half of the dough, so that you have two long logs of rolled dough. Slice each log with a knife to form approximately 8-12 rolls in total., 7- Lay each roll onto the topping-lined pan, spiral-side down. Cover with a sheet of parchment paper or wax paper and place inside the warmed (off) oven for 25 minutes to rise. , After rising, remove the parchment paper and cover the pan with oiled aluminum foil. , Turn oven up to 350º F (static) or 325º F (convection). OR cover tightly and place in refrigerator overnight then bring to room temperature the next morning then follow bake instructions. , When oven has come to temperature, bake for approximately 30-35 minutes - longer if refrigerated overnight (remove the foil after 20 minutes). The rolls will be light brown and have risen nicely; a toothpick inserted into the center of the rolls should come out fairly dry -- if it's wet with dough, keep baking with foil on top., When done, turn the oven off and open the oven door to let the rolls cool slowly for about 5 minutes., 8- Remove from the oven to cool for 5 minutes, then pull up on the parchment and turn upside-down on a plate for another 5 minutes. The rolls will drop onto the plate and the pan can be removed. Scrape any toppings out from the parchment and onto the rolls if they don't come out with the rolls., CROCKPOT METHOD:, 7- Lay each roll on top of the toppings in the crock pot, spiral-side down. Cover with the lid and let the rolls rise on the low setting for 30 minutes or cover and set in the fridge overnight, remove to come to room temperature then rise before baking., After rising, turn to high setting and bake for 2 – 2 1/2 hours, or until a toothpick inserted into the rolls comes out clean. Crockpots vary significantly -- one I used took 2 hours; another took 6! If your crockpot high temperature is in the 212° F range, it will take more like 6 hours to cook through. (Although it's a long wait, the good news is that it smells amazing and it is hard to overcook them inside the crock pot!), 8- Once cooked, turn crock pot bowl upside-down on a plate; the rolls will drop onto the plate and the bowl can be removed., (This method is particularly helpful if you make the rolls and let the crock pot do the work for you so that they are ready after church or a last minute holiday shopping trip!), Serve warm, but be sure to grab a roll for yourself before they’re all gone!, Yields 8-12 rolls, depending on how small you cut them.","[('gfjules all purpose gluten-free flour', 2.0, 'cups'), ('powdered gluten free vanilla pudding mix', 0.25, 'cup'), ('baking soda', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('baking powder', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('shortening', 0.25, 'cup'), ('honey', 3.0, 'tbs'), ('agave nectar', 3.0, 'tbs'), ('pure maple syrup', 3.0, 'tbs'), ('eggs', 2.0, None), ('flaxseed meal', 2.0, 'tbs'), ('warm water', 6.0, 'tbs'), ('vanilla yogurt', 1.0, 'cup'), ('apple cider vinegar', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('rapid rise yeast', 2.25, 'tsp'), ('butter', 0.25, 'cup'), ('earth balance buttery sticks', 0.25, 'cup'), ('light brown sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('coconut palm sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('ground cinnamon', 1.0, 'tbs'), ('pure maple syrup', 0.5, 'cup'), ('agave nectar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('dark karo syrup', 0.5, 'cup'), ('pecans', 1.0, 'cup')]"

Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/silicone spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula is a better choice.*, On medium speed, beat in the remaining sugar (which should be 1/2 cup, or 100g) and the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Add the eggs and salt and beat on medium speed until combined. The butter won’t really be mixing into the mixture, so don’t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. Switch the mixer down to low speed and with it running, add 1 cup of flour at a time, making sure it’s fully incorporated before adding the next. After 4 cups have been added, add the last 1/2 cup and beat until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 3 minutes. Dough will be soft., Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st Rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), Meanwhile, make the topping, Grease the bottom and sides of a 9×13-inch glass baking dish or metal baking dish. Spread chopped pecans in an even layer in the pan. Set aside. Combine the rest of the topping ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the butter has melted, then bring to a simmer. Allow to simmer for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, give it a quick whisk, then pour over pecans. Set aside., Roll out the dough, Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 12×18-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll it out, stop what you’re doing, cover it lightly, and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When you return to the dough, it should stretch out much easier., For the filling, Spread the softened butter all over the dough. The softer the butter is, the easier it is to spread in this step. (Microwave it for a few seconds to soften if needed.) In a small bowl, mix the sugar and cinnamon together. Sprinkle evenly over the butter. Tightly roll up the dough to form an 18-inch-long log. If some filling spills out, sprinkle it on top of the roll. With an extra sharp knife, cut into 12 even rolls, about 1.5 inches each. Arrange in the prepared baking pan, on top of the pecan topping., 2nd Rise, Cover the rolls tightly and allow to rise until puffy, about 90 minutes. (Or use the overnight option in the Notes below.), Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Bake for about 25–28 minutes or until they are lightly browned on top. About halfway through the bake time, loosely tent a piece of aluminum foil over the top of the pan to prevent the tops from browning too quickly. Remove pan from the oven and place on a wire rack. Cool for 5 minutes., Using oven mitts, carefully invert the pan onto a large serving platter. The warm topping will melt down the sides.

Set aside for about five minutes, or until foamy on top. (See Notes if yours is having trouble foaming.) Meanwhile, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt in a separate, large bowl., When the yeast is foamy, add the yogurt, egg, egg yolk, vanilla extract, and melted butter to the yeast-milk mixture and whisk to combine. (If you like, you can save the egg white and use it as a quick egg wash before you bake the rolls.), Add the wet ingredients to the dry, then mix with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until all the flour is incorporated and a wet, sticky dough forms. Knead in the bowl for 5-6 minutes. The dough will be very wet — the looser and stickier the dough is now, the fluffier and softer the rolls will be later, so don’t worry if it seems gloppy, and try not to add too much flour as you knead. If kneading with your hands, you can add a bit of flour as necessary to keep from sticking, but I just kneaded it by folding it in on itself with a large rubber spatula, which did the trick just fine and kept things from getting frustrating. When the dough begins to look a bit smoother and more elastic, cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and place it in the refrigerator to rise overnight. (Alternatively, you can let the dough rise at room temperature for about 2 hours, or until well-doubled — I prefer overnight to allow the flavor and gluten to develop more fully, and because a cold dough is much easier to work with, especially a delicate one like this.), The night before or the day of, For the filling, bring a cup or so of water to boil in a kettle or small pot. Pour enough boiling water over the dates to fully submerge them, and let soak until soft, about 10 minutes. Drain the water, then add the dates to a food processor or blender. Add the melted butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon, then process until smooth. You may need to scrape down the sides once or twice. Set aside until ready to use, or, if made the night before, refrigerate., The day of, Generously flour a work surface and scrape the still-cold dough onto it. (No need to let the refrigerated dough come to room temperature. It will warm during the second rise, and I find that a cold dough is much easier to roll and work with.) Roll the dough out to a large rectangle, about 10”x13” or thereabouts, and about 1/4″ in thickness. Spread the date mixture across the dough, leaving a 1/2″ border around the edges. Gently but tightly roll the rectangle into a log. Rolling the rectangle width-wise will give you larger cinnamon rolls with more swirls; length-wise, smaller. Either way, pinch the seam shut and place the log seam-side down., Using unflavored dental floss or a serrated knife, gently slice the log into about 8 to 10 rolls, a little more than an inch in width. If using a knife, cut by gently moving the knife back and forth in a sawing motion to avoid pressing down on the dough — that should help it keep its shape. It’s important to use a serrated knife rather than a smooth-edged one., Place the rolls, cut-side down, into a 9-inch pie plate or cast-iron skillet, or an 8×8-inch square baking dish. Leave some space for them to expand; if you run out of room, bake the extras in individual ramekins or free-form on a baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rise for about 45 minutes to an hour, or until rolls are almost doubled again. (If you like, you can do an overnight rise in the refrigerator at this point as well, or even freeze the rolls, well-wrapped. Either way, just bring the rolls to room temperature before baking. See Notes below for a Christmas schedule!), About 30 minutes before you’re ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 F. When the rolls are nearly doubled, brush them with the remaining egg white, if you like, then bake about 18-22 minutes, or until rolls are just barely golden in spots — this will ensure that they’re still nice and soft in the center. If using a cast-iron pan, you may want to take them out a minute or two earlier, since the pan retains heat so well and will continue to cook the rolls for a bit afterwards., While the rolls cool, make the frosting. Using an electric mixer or plenty of arm strength, beat the butter and cream cheese together until smooth. Add the confectioners’ sugar in batches, beating vigorously after each addition until smooth. Finally, add the vanilla and the maple syrup and beat again to incorporate. If you want more of a glaze than a frosting, add the milk, a tablespoon at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency. I added about 2 tablespoons. Spread over the rolls while still slightly warm to let the frosting melt into the crags, and enjoy immediately.","[('milk', 0.25, 'cup'), ('yeast', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('flour', 250.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 37.0, 'g'), ('salt', 0.125, 'tsp'), ('yogurt', 60.0, 'g'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('egg yolk', 1.0, None), ('vanilla extract', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('butter', 42.0, 'g'), ('dates', 1.0, 'cup'), ('brown sugar', 12.0, 'g'), ('cinnamon', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('butter', 14.0, 'g'), ('butter', 56.0, 'g'), ('cream cheese', 56.0, 'g'), ('powdered sugar', 125.0, 'g'), ('vanilla extract', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('maple syrup', 15.0, 'ml'), ('milk', 15.0, 'ml')]"

Mix with a wooden spoon. If necessary, reach into your mixing vessel with very wet hands and press the mixture together. Don’t knead! It isn’t necessary. You’re finished when everything is uniformly moist, without dry patches. Dough should be wet and loose enough to conform to the shape of the container., Allow to rise: Cover with a lid (not airtight) that fits well to the container you’re using. Allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse (or at least flattens on the top), approximately two hours. You can use a portion of the dough any time after this period, but fully refrigerated dough is less sticky and is easier to work with. So, the first time you try this method, it’s best to refrigerate the dough overnight before shaping a loaf.","[('water', 3.0, 'cups'), ('yeast', 1.0, 't.'), ('salt', 1.5, 't.'), ('flour', 6.5, 'cups')]"

Mix warm milk (heated to about 100°F or 38°C), 2 tablespoons of sugar, and yeast. Stir until it gets foamy on top, which takes around 5 minutes. If you don't have a mixer, you can do this by hand with a wooden spoon or spatula. It might take some effort, but it works. Avoid using a hand mixer because the sticky dough can get stuck in the beaters., wet ingredients, Add the remaining sugar, eggs, and salt: Start by adding the rest of the sugar (1/2 cup/100g) and the softened butter to the bowl. Mix them on medium until the butter looks a little broken up. Next, put in the eggs and salt and mix again on medium. The butter might not mix in all the way and stay in little bits, but that's okay., mix in flour, Gradually Add Flour: Lower the mixer speed and slowly add all-purpose flour, one cup at a time. Make sure each cup mixes in before adding the next one. Sometimes, stop to scrape the sides of the bowl to ensure everything mixes evenly. After adding the first 4 cups, add the remaining ½ cup and keep mixing until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. This should take about 3 minutes. Your dough will be soft., knead dough, Knead the Dough: Keep the dough in the mixer (use the dough hook if you started with the paddle attachment) and knead it for another 5 minutes. Alternatively, you can knead it by hand on a lightly floured surface for the same amount of time. If the dough gets too sticky while kneading, add 1 teaspoon of flour at a time until it becomes soft and a bit tacky. Be careful not to add too much flour; you don't want the dough to become dry. The dough should still feel somewhat soft after kneading. To check if it's ready, poke it with your finger; it should slowly bounce back. You can also do a ""windowpane test"" by stretching a small piece of dough until light passes through it without tearing., first rise, First Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Put the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides with oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a kitchen towel.

Usually, it takes about 2 hours on the counter., prepare baking dish, Prepare Baking Dish: Grease the bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch metal or glass baking dish., sauce, Make the Sauce: While the dough is undergoing its first rise, take this time to prepare the sauce for the sticky buns. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter, then add the brown sugar and syrup. Stir constantly until the mixture is smooth and well combined. This should take about 2-3 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the whipping cream. Remove from heat, add the cream, mix well to combine. Pour into the prepared pan and set aside to cool., roll, Roll Out the Dough: After the dough has risen, gently punch it down to release the air. Place it on a floured work surface and use a floured rolling pin to roll it out into a smooth 12x18-inch rectangle. Ensure the dough is even and doesn't shrink as you roll it. Cover it lightly. If it does, let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. This will make it easier to roll out., filling, Prepare the Filling: Spread melted butter evenly over the dough. In a small bowl, mix sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle this mixture evenly over the butter. Roll up the dough tightly into an 18-inch-long log. If some filling spills out, sprinkle it on top of the roll.

Grease a large mixing bowl for the proofing of your dough, and grease a 9×13″ casserole dish lined with parchment paper. Set aside., Make the dough:, Whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, and quick rise yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer or a large mixing bowl. Add in the warm dairy free milk, along with the dairy free yogurt. Attach the bowl to a stand mixer with dough hook attachment, and mix on medium-speed until a shaggy dough forms. Add in the vegan butter and continue mixing on high-speed to knead the dough for 7-10 minutes. Hold your stand mixer in place if it’s moving around, or use a wooden spoon or knead by hand if making the dough by hand., Proof:, Once the dough is kneaded, place the kneaded dough into the greased bowl and cover with a clean dish towel. Let the dough rise until doubled in size in a warm place (ideally 85F), about 30-60 minutes, depending on the temperature., While the dough is proofing:, Prep the filling. In a small bowl, mix together the cinnamon and coconut sugar. Set aside. Then we’ll make the topping while the dough is still proofing, Make the pecan topping:, Prepare the pecan topping while the dough is still rising. In a medium sauce pan, melt the vegan butter and sugar on medium heat until the sugar is melted into the vegan butter, about 3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the sugar! Once melted, remove the pan from heat, and whisk in the maple syrup and vanilla, followed by pecan pieces. Pour the topping onto the bottom of your prepared casserole dish. The rolls will bake on top, then you’ll flip them to make the pecan topping on top and the rolls on the bottom., Roll and shape the sticky buns, Once doubled in size, lightly flour a clean surface, and place the dough in the middle of the lightly floured surface. Flour the top of the dough and a rolling pin. Roll the dough out to be 12×18″ long. Spread the melted vegan butter along with brown sugar cinnamon filling onto the dough to the edges of the rectangle. Now, on the 18″ side, mark where you’ll slice the sticky buns every 1.5″. Once marked, you’ll use a pizza cutter or a large kitchen knife to slice the 1.5″ strips that are each 12″ long. Roll each strip into a cinnamon roll shape, and place the roll into the prepared baking pan on top of the pecan caramel sauce., Rest the rolls again:, While the rolls are covered and resting, preheat the oven to 350F., Bake the sticky buns:, Place the rested rolls, which have now doubled in size, into the oven to bake for 35-38 minutes, or until the tops of the rolls are lightly golden brown., Flip:, Allow the buns to cool for 10-15 minutes. Then place a piece of parchment paper on top of the buns, followed by a cooling rack.

Knead the levain until it forms a cohesive ball. Set in a liquid measuring cup and cover for 10-12 hours until the levain has doubled in size and the top is rounded., Sticky Pecan Roll Dough, Warm the milk in the microwave (about 1 1/2 minutes full power) or on the stove. It should be around 90-100 degrees F, no warmer than that. To the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook, add the ripe levain, warmed milk and melted butter., Add the sugar, eggs, salt and most of the bread flour. Turn on the dough hook and knead for a few minutes. Add the remainder of the bread flour as needed. The dough should be tacky, not overly sticky and should all cling to one side of the bowl (or away from the edges depending on your mixer). Knead for a total of 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth., Bulk Fermentation: Put the dough in a container and cover. Set the dough in a warm, 78-80 degree F place for 4 hours. Take the temperature of the dough as needed to make sure the dough temperature stays right around 78 degrees F. This temperature is optimal for fermentation., At the end of about 4 hours, the dough should be puffed up and feel very elastic. If it doesn't feel this way, let it bulk ferment for another half hour and check again., Overnight Refrigeration: At this point, after the bulk fermentation has finished, cover the dough and put it in the refrigerator. Proceed with the recipe the next day, shaping and proofing the rolls before baking. This allows you to time the sticky pecan rolls for breakfast or brunch if desired. If you prefer to shape the rolls and bake them the same day, skip the overnight refrigeration and proceed with the recipe., Mix up the Filling: Near the end of bulk fermentation, mix up the cinnamon roll filling. To a small bowl, add the melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and flour. Mix together. Set aside., Prepare the Pan with Sticky Pecan Topping: Pour the chopped pecans (I like to give them a few pulses in the blender) in the bottom of a 9 by 13 glass baking dish. To a small saucepan over medium heat add the butter, brown sugar, maple syrup, heavy cream and salt. Let simmer for about 2 minutes. Then remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Pour this sauce over the pecans in the pan., Shaping: Dump the dough on the counter and roll the dough out into an approximate 18 by 12 rectangle. Mix up the cinnamon filling by mixing softened butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and flour together until it forms a thick paste. Spread the cinnamon filling all over the dough with your fingers, making sure to cover up to the edges of the cinnamon roll. Starting with the dough closest to you, roll up the cinnamon roll and pinch together the seam. Flip the cinnamon roll over, seam side down. Cut the long log of cinnamon roll dough into 12 equal pieces. Place the cinnamon rolls on top of the gooey pecan mixture in a 3 by 4 grid., Proofing: Cover the pan and let rise in a 78 degree F place until puffed up and risen, about 3 hours. Do not bake these rolls if they have not risen., Baking: Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake risen rolls about 25-30 minutes until baked all the way through.

Stir to combine and allow the mixture to simmer together until the butter melts and everything comes together, stirring every so often, about 7-10 minutes. Look for the pecan praline sauce to thicken some and coat the back of a spoon., Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the pecan pieces. Transfer the pecan praline sauce into an airtight container. If making these sticky buns on the same day, leave the sauce out on the counter. Otherwise, transfer the sauce into the fridge until you’re ready to use. If refrigerating, when ready to use, simply reheat the sauce in a saucepan before the next step, below., Pour the sauce into a 9×9 inch baking pan (or any comparable oven-safe vessel) use a spoon or offset spatula to spread the sauce into an even layer into the pan. Then set aside., For the dough: Make sure the milk is warmed up to around 110°F. I like to place my cold milk in a microwave safe vessel and microwave it for 45-50 seconds, it should be warm (if yours is too hot, set aside until it cools down and reaches desired 110°F temperature). In the bowl of a stand mixer, sprinkle in the yeast and sugar and then pour in the warmed milk. Let mixture sit, undisturbed, for 7-10 minutes for the yeast to activate (when using active dry yeast)- the mixture will be bubbly and fragrant. *If using instant yeast– no need to wait for the mixture to bloom, proceed directly to the next step., Next, add in the melted butter, egg, flour, and salt. Place the dough hook attachment onto stand mixer and knead on medium speed until the dough begins to come together, about 6-8 minutes. Look for the dough to be smooth. Alternatively, if not using a stand mixer- knead the dough by hand for 10 minutes on a lightly floured surface., Shape the dough into a ball and place it into a lightly greased large bowl. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and then a clean kitchen towel/linen- let the dough rise in a warm environment until it doubles in size, about 1-2 hours or longer depending on the temperature of your environment., Once the dough has risen, punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface work area. Roll the dough out into a rectangle, about 10×12 inches, now let’s prepare the filling., For the filling: Spread the softened butter over the dough, leaving a slight margin around the edges. I like to use my hands (with disposable gloves, if desired) to do this. Then sprinkle on the brown sugar followed by evenly sprinkling the cinnamon all over the top. Use your hand to gently pat the sugar/cinnamon mixture onto the dough., Roll up the dough into a tight log starting from the longest side with the seam side down. While in log position, use your hands to carefully stretch out the log, if needed. Then pinch the seam to nicely seal in the edges as much as you can. I like to cut off a bit of the ends of the dough because they are not as full in size as the other sections., Use a large sharp knife/unscented dental floss to cut the log crosswise into 9 pieces.

Cover the dish with plastic wrap/kitchen towel. Allow the rolls to rise again in a warm environment for another 1-2 hours until puffy. Towards the end of their rise time, preheat the oven to 350°F., Uncover the rolls by removing the plastic wrap/kitchen towel. Bake the rolls until they’re golden brown, about 30-35 minutes., Remove the pan from the oven. Very carefully, using oven mitts, invert the pan immediately onto a large plate or platter. If any sticky bits remain in the pan, simply scrape out onto the buns. Allow the buns to cool down before touching, about 10-15 minutes, as the sticky topping will be very hot.

You will know the yeast is working if the mixture begins to form bubbles on top., While waiting to see if the yeast is active, peel and grate your carrots and set aside., Next, add the melted vegan butter, grated carrots, and vanilla to the mixing bowl and stir to combine. Then, add the flour and salt to the mixing bowl 1/2 cup at a time and mix. Once a dough forms, switch a standing mixer to the bread hook and knead for 5 minutes. If kneading by hand, remove the dough and knead on a well-floured surface for 5-10 minutes until an elastic dough forms., Lightly spray a large bowl with oil, form the dough into a ball, and add the dough to the bowl. Oil the top of the dough so it does not dry out. Then, cover the bowl and let the dough rise 1-1.5 hours until it has doubled in size. You will know the dough is done by pushing your finger into the dough and the dough will not spring back., Making the Sticky Syrup, While the dough is rising make the syrup by adding the butter and sugar to a pan and mixing on low heat until combined. Add the syrup and chopped pecans to the pan you plan to bake the buns in (I recommend a 9*13 inch baking dish for sticky buns. Store the syrup filled pan in the fridge until the buns are ready (it's okay if it solidifies)., Rolling the buns, Once your dough has doubled in size, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. You will need to flour the rolling pin too or else the dough will stick. Roll the dough into a rectangle that is 1/4-1/2 inch thick in height., In a small bowl or blender blend the bun filling ingredients together. Spread the filling evenly over the dough leaving a 1/2 inch border without any filling., Beginning with the longer side of the rectangle, tightly roll up the dough into a log. Lightly flour the dough as you go to help if it gets a bit sticky. Make sure to seal the roll by pinching the edges together. Then, flip the dough over so the pinched seal is facing down., Once the dough is rolled, trim the ends and discard. Cut the remaining dough into 10-12 evenly sized rolls. Remove the pan containing the syrup from the fridge and arrange all the rolls in the pan. Cover the pan and leave in the fridge overnight (or 30 minutes in a warm place) before baking., Baking the rolls, Remove the rolls from the fridge or warm place after the second rise and preheat the oven to 350F. Once the oven is preheated, add in the buns and bake for 30-35 minutes until the dough in lightly browned on top.

Pour sauce into a 9-x-13-inch pan., You can let the sauce sit. It will start to get hard but that is fine as once baked it will get gooey again. Once dough has risen punch down the dough., Divide dough in half., Mix together the filling of butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon until full combined., Roll out half of dough into a rectangle, about 10″x15″. Spread half of the cinnamon brown sugar mixture over the dough, leaving a 1″ border on all sides. Brush egg wash along edges of dough., Begin to jellyroll the dough, starting from the shortest side. Pinch seams together along length and ends to seal the roll completely. This is a super important step – take the time to ensure that all edges are sealed., After the seams have been pinched, gently roll back and forth a couple of times to reinforce the seams. Gently roll the dough onto the center of a piece of parchment paper that’s wide enough to hold the roll entirely and about 14″ long (about 30″ x 15″)., Bring a roasting pan with the 8 cups of water and baking soda up to a rolling boil. Gently lift the parchment paper by bringing together its edges, creating a little “purse” with the dough roll inside, and lower into the roasting pan. Pull the parchment from under the roll until the roll is sitting on the edge of the parchment (don’t completely remove the roll from the top of the parchment). The parchment tends to want to float in the water, so use a spoon to poke the parchment down and expose the dough to the water. Poach for 30 seconds. Using the parchment paper as a guide, gently tug the end of the parchment where the roll is toward you, using the parchment to guide the flipping of the roll over onto its other side., Poach for an additional 30 seconds. This is tricky and takes care and patience, since the roll is a bit fragile., Remove the roll from the baking soda water.

Stir and let stand 5 minutes, or until the mixture bubbles and foams., To the yeast mixture, add the remaining 1/3 cup sugar, milk, butter, yolks, cardamom, salt and 3 cups of the flour. Mix on low speed until well incorporated. Switch to the dough hook attachment and beat on low speed while slowly incorporating more flour. When a smooth, elastic, and slightly sticky dough is formed, stop adding flour. You may not need to use the entire last cup of flour, (however, my dough required all of the flour to reach consistency). Increase mixer speed to medium and beat for 5 minutes longer with the dough hook., Form the dough into a ball and transfer to a greased bowl; cover with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place to rise, 1 hour (or until doubled). Meanwhile, make the filling and topping., For the filling, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, and cardamom in a bowl. Whisk to combine; set aside. Keep dry mixture and butter separate for now., For the topping, combine the brown sugar, butter, maple syrup, and corn syrup in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the butter and sugar are melted and a thick, syrupy mixture is achieved., Coat a 10-inch round cake pan with cooking spray. Pour the topping mixture into the pan and spread evenly. Immediately sprinkle with the chopped pecans. Let cool 5 minutes, then pat the pecans into the syrup mixture so they form a flat bed on which you can place the sweet roll., Assemble the sweet roll: Punch down the sweet dough and divide in half. Roll out one piece of dough on a lightly floured surface to an approximate 15×10-inch rectangle (about 1/4-inch thickness). This doesn’t have to be perfect, just do the best you can. Melt the butter called for in the filling ingredients. Using a pastry brush, cover the rectangle with half the butter. Sprinkle the butter with half of the dry filling mixture. Trim the edges of the rectangle to slightly square them off; cut the rectangle into 5 long pieces using a sharp knife or a bench scraper., Begin rolling a dough piece beginning at a short end, jelly roll style. When the first piece is rolled, lay it on a second piece of dough and roll up. Continue until you have rolled all of the pieces onto each other, and lay the rolled-up dough in the center of the 10-inch pan filled with the topping., Repeat the process with the remaining dough: roll it into a rectangle, brush with remaining butter and fill with remaining sugar mixture, and then cut into 5 long pieces. Pick up the pieces one by one and wind them around the center piece of dough in the pan. When all of the dough has been used, cover the pan and place in a warm area until puffed and approximately 1-inch away from the pan’s edge, about 45 minutes., Preheat the oven to 375° F.

Using oven mitts, immediately turn out the sticky bun onto the platter and carefully lift the pan away. The topping is extremely hot and sticky like napalm, so be careful. I don’t want you to get burned., Let cool slightly before serving. Sprinkle the top of the pastry with pinches of Maldon sea salt, if using. Serve slices of the sticky bun warm.

Add a pinch of sugar and stir to combine. Let it rest on the counter in a draft-free, warm place until it's foamy, about 5-7 minutes. If it doesn't foam, the yeast is dead; start over., Next, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter, and set aside to cool slightly., When the yeast is foamy, stir in the melted butter and remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar., Pour all of the wet ingredients over the flour in a medium bowl.

Whisk well to combine. Turn the heat to medium low and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes. Whisk well and remove from heat. Set aside to cool., Put the yeast in the bottom of the bowl of a stand mixer and add the warm water over it and a pinch of the sugar. Stir to combine and leave for a few minutes. Once it starts to foam a bit, you can be sure it’s safe to use., Pour the flour over the yeast along with the rest of the sugar, the oil, salt and vanilla and the buttermilk or milk powder. On one side of the bowl add the cooled tangzhong/roux. On the other crack in the eggs (this is to avoid the heat of the roux cooking the eggs before the dough is mixed)., Affix the dough hook and knead the dough on low speed, working it up to medium. Once the dough comes together around the dough hook, about 7-10 minutes., Set the dough in an oiled bowl, toss the dough around the bowl to cover it in the oil then cover the bowl and leave it to rise until almost, but not fully doubled, about 1.5-2 hours., While the dough is rising two quick things you can do:, Brown butter for the filling and set aside to cool. It’s best to use it when it’s at a ‘creamy’ stage so shaping the rolls won’t be messy., Preheat the oven to 350 and spread the raw pecans on a baking sheet. Toast the pecans for 10 minutes, until fragrant. Let cool and set aside., When the dough has risen, make the caramel for the bottom of the rolls:, Set the butter, brown sugar and heavy cream in a pot and add the fine sea salt. Once the butter melts and the sugar dissolves the mixture will start to boil. Let it boil vigorously for about 3-4 minutes then take it off the heat and stir in the vanilla., Pour the caramel into the bottom of a *greased* 13x9 inch cake pan. Tilt the pan so the caramel goes into the edges and is in an even layer. Sprinkle the pecans over the caramel. Set this aside while you shape the rolls., On a floured surface, roll out the dough to about a 12x18 inch rectangle. Spread the cooled brown butter over the dough, leaving a half inch border on one of the short sides. Mix the brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a bowl. Spread the brown sugar mixture over the butter in an even layer, using your hands or an offset spatula. If you like, you can add a sprinkle of finely chopped pecans., Roll up the dough from the longer edge in a tight log. Using unwaxed dental floss or a bread knife, slice the dough into 2 inch rolls. I usually slice off a bit of the edges before I start slicing for the rolls. Lay and arrange the rolls on top of the caramel with space between so they have room to rise and bake. Carefully lay a tea towel over the pan and let rise for 45 minutes., Preheat the oven to 350 F. Bake the rolls for about 25-30 minutes, until golden and fully puffed. To be sure the rolls are done baking, insert an instant thermometer into the center most roll, the temperature should read 190 F. If the rolls aren’t done but some are over-browning, tent the pan with foil as they finish baking., Give the rolls about 10 minutes on the counter to cool. Lay a sheet of parchment paper over the rolls and then a large cutting board over the paper. Carefully invert the pan (turn it upside down) and lift the pan away. If there are pecans still stuck to the pan, you can carefully take them out one by one and place them back on the caramel., These are best served warm and the day of baking but they’ll keep fine at room temperature and a 30 second warm up in the microwave will render them still wonderful the next day.","[('water', 240.0, 'g'), ('bread flour', 40.0, 'g'), ('yeast', 7.0, 'g'), ('buttermilk', 30.0, 'g'), ('milk', None), ('brown sugar', 100.0, 'g'), ('eggs', 2.0, None), ('canola oil', 52.0, 'g'), ('butter', 6.0, 'tbsp'), ('sea salt', 0.75, 'tsp'), ('vanilla extract', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('butter', 80.0, 'g'), ('butter', 113.0, 'g'), ('brown sugar', 200.0, 'g'), ('sea salt', None), ('cinnamon', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('pecans', None), ('pecans', None), ('butter', 113.0, 'g'), ('brown sugar', 200.0, 'g'), ('heavy cream', 80.0, 'g'), ('sea salt', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'tsp')]"

Alternatively, turn the dough into a floured surface, and knead by hand for about 10 minutes., You should knead the dough until it is barely sticking to the sides of the bowl. It can be sticking on the bottom of the bowl, but should come off the sides., The dough should be soft and smooth, tacky but not sticky., Shape it into a smooth ball., Place the dough in a large bowl greased with oil.

Set it aside., Assemble the rolls, To know if the dough is done rising, do the poke test. Gently poke the dough, it should form a small indentation, that slowly springs back, but not fully., If the dough springs back too quickly, it needs more proofing time. And if the dough doesn’t spring back at all, and a deep indentation forms when you poke it, it’s been over proofed., Turn the dough onto a floured surface. Sprinkle a very small amount of flour over the dough., Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a rectangle., It should be about 1/2” thick, and the rectangle should measure about 20×12”., While rolling the dough, lift it off the counter gently a few times, to give it a chance to spring back and settle, which will ensure the dough is being properly rolled out., If the dough keeps shrinking, let it sit on the counter for 5 to 10 minutes to relax the gluten., Spread the Cinnamon Butter Filling all over the surface of the dough, on an even layer., Make a tight roll with the dough, by gently rolling it from the widest size onto itself, making an 20” dough log., Cut the ends of the dough. I always cut them off so I can have all the rolls be straight with the same height. I bake those two small rolls separately and eat them as a treat., Divide the dough into 12 equal parts. I like to cut the rolls by placing a piece of floss underneath the dough and crossing it at the top, which makes a neat cut. If you use a knife to slice the rolls, it squishes them, and makes them pointy at the edges., Place each roll on top of the pecan caramel mixture, in three rows of four rolls each., Cover the tray with plastic wrap., Second rise: Let the dough rise for about 30 minutes to 1 hour, until puffed up., Baking, While the dough rises, pre-heat the oven to 375ºF.

It can take even up to 30 minutes, depending on the oven., The rolls should be browned around the edges and slightly browned in the center. Make sure the dough in the center is fully baked. If not, cover the rolls with foil and bake for another 3 to 5 minutes. Then check again, and repeat until they are baked through., It took me 25 minutes in my regular conventional oven to bake these rolls., Let the rolls cool down for 20 minutes. Serving, Flip the rolls onto a board, remove the parchment paper from the top, and serve., Storage, These rolls are best served the day they are made.

The trick for using cake batter to make pancakes is to add less liquid than it calls for on the box. I used a box that called for 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of vegetable oil. I added only 1/2 cup of water and it was the perfect thickness. If you are using a mix that calls for slightly different ingredients, just add 1/2 cup less liquid. Set the batter aside while you prep the other ingredients., To make the cinnamon sugar for the cinnamon swirl, just whisk all the ingredients together. Pour into a pastry bag or plastic bag and slice a small hole in the tip., For the toffee sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the sugar, and stir frequently until the mixture becomes golden brown. Then whisk in the cream and vanilla. Let simmer and thicken until the sauce is thick enough to stick on the back of a spoon. Keep warm over very low heat., To prepare the cream cheese frosting, beat the cream cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer. Once whipped, melt the butter, and slowly add it in while the mixer is running. Once the butter and cream cheese are well mixed, add the powdered sugar and vanilla and mix until smooth., Now it is time to make the pancakes. I recommend making them one by one. Add just a small slice of butter to a non-stick skillet and heat over medium heat. Once the butter melts add a little less than 1/3 cup of the batter to the skillet. Let the pancake cook for 1-2 minutes and then add a swirl of the cinnamon sugar. Let the pancake continue cooking until some bubbles form on top and the pancake is golden brown.

If it does not foam up, toss the mixture and start again with fresh yeast., Add in the remaining sugar along with 1/2 cup of softened butter and mix in the bowl until the butter is slightly broken up.

Heat it up until it's a touch warmer than luke warm. You don't want it too hot or else your yeast will die. And you don't want it too cold or else your yeast will not grow., Sprinkle in your yeast and a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar will feed the yeast as it grows. Set your bowl aside for at least 5 minutes to make sure that your yeast has activated. After 5 minutes you should have a growing layer of yeast at the top of your bowl. If not, start over and try again. This step is crucial in having cinnamon rolls that rise., Once you have activated your yeast, you'll add in your sugar, softened butter, salt and eggs.

After 5-8 minutes, the butter will begin browning; you’ll notice lightly browned specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan, and you'll begin to smell a nutty aroma. Once browned, immediately remove from heat, pour into a heat-proof bowl, and freeze until solidified, about 20 minutes., For the Brioche Dough:, In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large mixing bowl, combine 4 cups of the flour, Fleischmann’s®RapidRise®Instant Yeast, sugar, and salt.

If the icing is too thin, add a little more powdered sugar; if it's too thick, add more milk., Drizzle the icing over the warm cinnamon rolls once you remove them from the oven. Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store at room temperature for up to 3 days., Note:, *The amount of butter called for to make the brown butter is more than the amount of brown butter needed for the recipe. This is because the process of browning butter cooks off moisture from the butter, so it reduces in quantity. This recipe accounts for that difference, so you will see 1-½ cups of butter called for to make the brown butter, but only 1-¼ cups of total brown butter used in the dough, filling, and icing.

Leave it to sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy. Add to it the remaining sugar, eggs, flour, and salt. Turn the mixer on low and combine until it forms a thick but slightly sticky dough. Mix this dough for around 5 minutes to begin developing, Add in the cubed butter, a few pieces at a time. Incorporate each cube before the next addition., Turn the mixer on medium and keep it mixing until the sticky dough starts to strengthen and come together and pull away cleanly from the sides of the bowl. For the best gluten development and brioche crumb, mix the dough for at least 15 minutes. Proper gluten development will allow you to stretch the dough so thin you can almost see through it. This is called the 'window pane' effect., Pull the dough from the bowl onto a bench and form it into a ball. Place the dough ball into a clean bowl and cover it. Let it proof at room temperature for 1.5- 2 hours until doubled in size. The rising time will happen fastest with instant yeast and slower with active dried yeast., Deflate the dough gently and reshape it into a rough ball again. Cover it lid or plate, or a damp tea towel and place it in the fridge overnight. This step can be shortened, but a long cold proof of 8-12 hours gives the best flavor., Pull the proofed dough from the bowl and tip it onto a floured bench. Roll the dough out into a 12x18 inch (30x45cm) rectangle. Spread softened butter over the dough. In a bowl, mix together the brown sugar and ground cinnamon. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar over the butter. Tightly roll the dough to form an 18-inch/45cm long log. Slice the log into 12 even-sized pieces. The unraveling end parts of each roll can be tucked under to keep them tight., Grease a 12-inch/30cm cast-iron skillet or 9x13 inch/23x33cm baking dish. Place in the rolls and cover them with a light-weight, slightly dampened kitchen towel (to stop the tops drying out). Let them rise at room temperature, puffy, and doubled in size., Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C., Bake the brioche cinnamon rolls for approximately 25-28 minutes until puffed up and browned on the tops. The rolls can be covered with aluminum foil halfway through baking if the tops are browning too fast. After baking, let them cool for 10 minutes before glazing., The frosting, Beat the cream cheese in a mixer until smooth and creamy. Add the confectioners’ sugar, vanilla, and milk.

(melted) brown butter, 4 ounces cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1-2 Tbsp. milk (if needed)","To Make The Brown Butter:, Before you begin making the dough and filling, prepare your brown butter., To make brown butter in the microwave, place butter in a large microwaveable bowl and heat for 3-5 minutes, or until the butter has come to a boil and then turns an amber color. Be careful that the butter does not burn., To make brown butter on the stove, place butter in a large saucepan and heat over medium-high heat until boiling. Let the butter boil for 2-4 minutes, or until it turns an amber color. Be careful that the butter does not burn., To Make The Dough & Filling:, Pour the milk into a microwave-safe bowl. Heat on high in the microwave for 30 seconds, then remove and stir in the melted brown butter, and test the temperature with your finger. You want the mixture to be lukewarm, but not hot to the touch. If it is too cool, continue heating the mixture in the microwave for 20 second intervals, pausing after each to stir, until the mixture reaches the correct temperature. If the mixture gets too hot, let it sit out for a few minutes until it has cooled to the lukewarm temperature., In a separate bowl, whisk together 3 cups flour (not all of the flour), sugar and salt until combined., In the bowl of a stand mixer (**see note below for an alternative method of making this by hand*) fitted with the dough hook attachment, add yeast and lukewarm milk mixture and stir by hand to combine. Add the flour mixture and egg, and beat on medium-low speed until combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add the remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to form a ball and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Continue beating for 5 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the dough hook and cover the bowl with a damp towel and let rest for 10 minutes., Meanwhile, make your filling by whisking together sugars and cinnamon in a bowl until evenly combined., When the dough is ready, turn it out onto a floured work surface. Then use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 14 x 10 inches in size. (If you want all edges to be even, you can use a pizza slicer to cut the dough into a perfect rectangle.) Use a knife or pastry spatula to spread the melted brown butter evenly over the entire surface of the dough. Then sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar mixture evenly on top of the melted butter so that the entire surface of the dough is covered., Beginning at the 14-inch edge, tightly roll up the dough. And then give the final seam a little pinch so that it seals. Use a piece of dental floss*** to “cut” off the two ends of the roll (an inch on each end) so that they are even, then discard the dough that was cut away. Use the floss to cut the remaining dough into 12 equal pieces., (***To cut dough with dental floss, simply break off a piece of floss about 12 inches long. Then very carefully slide the middle of the floss under the dough to the place where you want to “cut”. Then pull the ends of the floss up and cross over the top of the dough, and give a quick tug to literally cut all the way through the dough. This is the best method for not squishing your dough while cutting it — although the standard knife method still works too.), Place each of the cut cinnamon rolls into a greased pie plate or 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Then cover again with a damp towel, and leave the dish in a warm place to rise for 25 minutes., While the dough is rising, make the icing (instructions below)., When the rolls have risen, uncover the dish. Then place on the center rack of the oven and bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes, or until the rolls are golden and cooked through. Remove and let cool on a wire rack for at least 5 minutes. Drizzle with frosting and serve., To Make The Brown Butter Cream Cheese Frosting:, Either in the bowl of an electric stand mixer, or a mixing bowl, whisk the melted brown butter and cream cheese together until combined.

Combine the flour and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside., Mix warm milk and 1 tsp. of sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let it stand for 5-10 minutes, until foamy. Add the remaining sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla until well combined. Then, mix in the flour mixture until the dough starts to come together. Using a dough hook (or your hands), knead for 7-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and slightly tacky. It should be a little sticky but shouldn't leave any dough on your hands. If it's too sticky, add flour 2 Tbs. at a time until it's the right consistency., Place the dough in an oiled bowl, and cover with a towel or plastic wrap. Place it in a warm, draft-free spot and let it rise until doubled in size, about 1 1/2-2 hours., While the dough is rising, make the filling. Stir together all of the ingredients. Set aside until ready to use., Butter a 9x13'' rectangle pan (or a 12'' round pan). Set aside. When the dough is doubled in size, punch it down. Transfer the dough to a clean, lightly floured surface, and roll until you have an 18x12'' rectangle. Spread the filling on the dough, leaving a 1/4'' gap on all sides. Tightly roll the dough length-wise, and pinch the edges to seal. Place the large roll in the freezer for 10-15 minutes (it makes it easier to cut!)., Once the dough is cold, cut the long roll into 10-12 cinnamon rolls and place them evenly in the buttered pan. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap, place it in a warm, draft-free area, and let the rolls rise for another 30-60 minutes, until puffy but not bubbly. Alternatively, skip the second rise, and refrigerate the rolls overnight to bake them the next day., *Note: To bake them the next day, remove the rolls from the fridge and let them rise at room temperature for 1-2 hours, until puffy., Preheat the oven to 350° F. Lightly warm 1/4 c. of cream, and brush it over the rolls. Bake until the rolls are a light golden brown, about 18-20 minutes. (I always under-bake them a little, because they will continue cooking once you take them out of the oven). Let them cool for about 5-10 minutes before frosting., Make the frosting while the rolls rise/bake. Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, swirling occasionally until the butter is toasty brown and smells nutty. (Be careful at this step as it burns quickly). Pour the butter into a bowl, and let it solidify on the counter or fridge until it's a softened texture., Combine the brown butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and salt.

Mix well with a wire whisk. Pour into the mixer bowl and secure the dough hook attachment to the mixer., Add the butter, shortening and eggs. Add 3 cups of the flour. Mix on low speed until ingredients are incorporated, about one minute. Stop and scrape down sides of bowl if needed., Turn mixer back on low speed, add the remaining 2 cups of flour, about 1/2 cup at a time. Allow each addition to fully incorporate. After adding the 2 cups of flour, let dough continue to mix for about 1 minute. Stop and scrape down sides of bowl if needed. If dough is not mostly cleaning sides of the bowl, add 1/4 cup of flour and mix until fully combined. Stop mixer and lightly tap on dough with fingertip. If the dough feels excessively wet and sticky, add another 1/4 cup of flour and fully combine. If the dough feels soft and tacky, but not wet, knead on low for 6-8 minutes until smooth and cohesive., Remove dough from mixer and place in a greased bowl. Turn the dough, coating all sides in the nonstick spray. Cover with clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 60-90 minutes., Prepare the Brown Butter Cream Cheese Frosting, Add the cubed butter to a small saucepan. Melt on medium low heat. Allow it to come to a low simmer. Stir frequently to allow the butter to cook evenly. After about 4-5 minutes, you’ll see the butter start to brown and give off a slightly nutty aroma. Once you see small, golden brown speckles, remove the pan from the heat. (avoid over browning), Immediately pour the butter into a heat safe bowl and refrigerate until it becomes solid, about 1-2 hours. Allow the butter to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before using., In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the brown butter and cream cheese until smooth, about 2 minutes., Add the vanilla and sal. Add half of powdered sugar. Mix on low until combined and smooth. Misture will be thick. Add 1-2 Tablespoons of milk to thin the mixture. Continue to add the remainder of the powdered sugar, alternating with just enough milk to yield a creamy frosting. Cover and set aside., Prepare the filling, In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients for the filling with a spoon or rubber spatula. Stir until fully combined and creamy., It's time to roll, Divide dough into tow equal portions (about 28-30 ounces each). Round each portion to an oval shaped piece of dough by pulling the dough and tucking it underneath itself. This will make it easier to roll out into a rectangle., Flour work surface and roll dough out to a rectangle, about 10×18-inches., Spread half of the Biscoff Filling on the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on the top edge of the rectangle. Leaving this border will help in sealing the dough shut when rolled up., Star with the long side closest to you, and working from left to right, begin to roll dough up. You can tug and pull as you go, which will tighten the roll and make more swirls., Once it’s all rolled up, pinch the seam shut by pinching the edge of the dough to the roll., Cut the roll into 9, 2-inch cinnamon rolls (I find using dental floss makes the cleanest cuts!)., Place cinnamon rolls on a 13×18-inch baking sheet, either sprayed with nonstick spray or lined with parchment paper. Space cinnamon rolls about 2 inches apart. Repeat steps 2-7 with the second piece of dough. You should be able to fit all 18 cinnamon rolls on one half size sheet pan., Cover and let rise until puffy (see notes for Poke Test), about 45-60 minutes. Towards the end of the rise time, preheat oven to 350°F/177°C., Bake, Bake for 18-22 minutes or until edges are medium golden brown.

Do this by hand or by using a pastry blender., In a small bowl, whisk egg, milk, and vanilla together, then pour into the flour mixture., Mix quickly into a dough, handling as little as possible so as to not melt the butter. You want to still see the pieces of butter throughout., Shape the dough into a small rectangle, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 3 hours or overnight., Once the dough has chilled and rested, on a floured surface, roll the dough out to a large rectangle, about 8 x 15 inches (20 x 28 cm)., Fold the dough in thirds, like a letter, so that the dough is in 3 layers (see video above.), Re-flour your surface if needed, and then re-roll the dough into a large rectangle, turn it, and re-fold into thirds., Repeat this rolling, turning, and folding one more time, then wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour., After the dough has been rested and chilled for an hour, repeat the rolling and folding process 1 more time: Roll, turn, and fold 3 more times., Wrap the dough well and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days. For longer storage, this dough can be frozen, well wrapped or in an airtight container, for up to 1 month. Defrost overnight in the refrigerator before using it., Filling, Rolling and Cutting the Dough, In a bowl, mix together granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Set aside., Butter a 12-cup muffin tin generously with melted butter.

(If you do 10 buns instead of 12 you get much bigger buns), Cover the dough and let rise in a warm place until puffed, about 60 minutes. Tip: I preheat my oven for 2 minutes, then turn it off and place it in the tray of buns. This warmth gives them a great environment to proof well., At the end of the rise time, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C)., Uncover the dough and bake until golden brown, about 20-25 minutes. You might notice some melted butter around your rolls and that is ok, don't worry. That will bake into the buns and just make an incredible, buttery dough., Let cool in the tin for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely., These buns are best the day they are made, but you can store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature overnight or in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

I tested with less and it tasted bland.), 1 cup (240g) canned lite coconut milk (not full-fat!), room temperature! (can shaken first), 1/4 cup (60g) cooked, peeled, mashed yukon gold potato, 3 tablespoons (60g) pure maple syrup, 1/4 cup (64g) roasted walnut butter (follow instructions here), 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract (optional), 1/2 cup coconut sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon, 1/4 cup (64g) roasted walnut butter, 1 cup (128g) powdered sugar (sifted if lumpy), 2 tablespoons (30g) non-dairy unsweetened yogurt (I use the So Delicious plain coconut), 1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, For a recipe like this to require such precision, I recommend using a scale. It will make the process much easier and less room for error. You will only need a scale and bowls, no measuring cups to compare. Follow the grams and you are good to go. Make sure to zero out before adding each ingredient., I use this scale.","Follow the photo steps in the post to help guide you. I've explained everything in great detail. First, you will need to make the walnut butter. You can make this the day before if you like to get a jump start. It takes all of 20 minutes from start to finish. Once that is done, making the rolls are incredibly easy., To a very large, deep tall bowl (if possible), add the flour, instant yeast and salt. Whisk well., Cook a medium yukon gold potato with the skin on wrapped in a damp paper towel in the microwave until squishy soft. 3-5 minutes. If you don't want to use a microwave, bake it, but this will obviously add much more time. Do not boil or steam it, as this will add too much moisture to the potato and affect the dough. Peel the skin off the potato, mash well with a fork and weigh 60 grams in a separate medium bowl (not the bowl with the flour) Set aside., To the same bowl with the potato, weigh the milk, maple syrup, vanilla (if using) and ONLY 1/4 cup (64g) walnut butter (you'll use another 1/4 cup for the flling). Transfer this mixture to a food processor. Process for a couple of minutes until 100% smooth and no bits or chunks of potato remain. You want to make sure it's totally a smooth liquid., Pour the liquid (scrape the processor out well) over the dry ingredients. Use a large silicone or rubber spoon, this will be easier than using a metal one. Stir for a few minutes until it comes together into a rough, shaggy looking dough (pictured above). This means it is not smooth or fully mixed. It will seem dry at first, but don't be tempted to add more milk! Mixing by hand (as opposed to an electric dough hook) will take longer. Stir until about 90% of it is combined., Flour a work surface lightly and scrape the dough out. Knead the dough for just a couple of minutes, rotating, pressing and flipping over the dough until it comes together into a smooth round ball. This should be fairly quick, as mixing with your hands at this point is much easier than a spoon. Do not over mix the dough, you just want it smooth and combined. Overworking the dough can make for tough rolls. It should not be sticking to your hands, but be easy to work with., Rinse out the large bowl you just used and wipe it dry. Add the ball of dough back to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap (sprayed with nonstick spray if it's a short or shallow bowl, otherwise the dough will stick) and seal it around the edges. Alternatively, if you have a really tall bowl like I used, and don't like to use plastic, use a slightly damp towel to cover the bowl. I prefer the plastic wrap method, as it really traps the air and moisture to help the yeast work., Turn on the oven light, but don't turn the oven on! Place the bowl in the oven and let it rise 45 minutes to an hour, or until it looks to have about doubled in size. Mine took around an hour and a few minutes. Please keep in mind, judge this rise by the look, not the time, as each environment and climate will affect how quickly it rises., Remove the bowl from the oven once it's ready and scrape the dough back onto the lightly floured work surface. It'll be a comforting warm temperature. Use a rolling pin to gently roll out into a rectangular shape of about 10 1/2 inches wide by 16 inches long. It should be about 1/4 inch thick. Should only take a minute., At this time, preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and line a pan with parchment paper., Use a pastry or silicone brush to lightly brush on some coconut milk in a thin layer. This is important so that the cinnamon sugar mixture adheres well and doesn't create open gaps while baking. It also makes the interior moist where butter would normally be used!, In a small bowl, combine the cinnamon, coconut sugar and ONLY the 1/4 cup (64g) remaining walnut butter. Mix and press together with the back of a spoon or fork until it resembles a moist, crumbly consistency. Sprinkle this all over the dough evenly, leaving about a 1/2 inch boarder along the edges., Start with the long end and gently and tightly roll it into a log. You will need to trim off the ends as these are mostly dough without the filling. About 1-2 inches worth. Use a very sharp knife or serrated knife to gently cut into rolls, 1 1/2 inches thick (if rolled out correct) yielded 10 perfect size rolls. The dough will be soft, but they do slice fairly easily. I used a really sharp smooth knife and preferred this over serrated. You will need to hold each roll with one hand as you slice down, doing a gentle sawing motion. In between each slice, pat your knife with a little extra flour. This will help slicing, as the knife gets sticky with the filling., Carefully pick up each roll and lay it (filling side up) onto the pan spaced at least 2 inches apart. I fit 8 on the first pan. Bake them for 18-20 minutes or until looking golden brown. Mine were perfect at 19 minutes, but ovens can vary., Add the icing ingredients to a bowl and stir until it is moistened. It will seem too dry, but will come together. Whisk rapidly until completely smooth and sugar is dissolved. After the rolls have come out of the oven, let them sit 5-10 minutes before icing them. Add a spoonful of icing on the center of each roll and spread around to let it drizzle down the sides. Serve while warm! See notes if you would like to bake them in a dish close together., Store extra rolls tightly covered at room temperature so they don't dry out.

Add the buttermilk and stir. Warm the mixture just until it reaches between 110-115 degrees F.If it gets too hot, let it sit for a few minutes until it cools down to the correct temperature. It's important that you check the temperature – if it's too cold, it won't activate the yeast, and if it's too hot, it will kill the yeast., In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the warm butter and milk, 3 cups of flour, sugar, salt, nutmeg, yeast, eggs and vanilla extract. Knead for 5 minutes on medium/low speed. The dough will be soft, loose and sticky., Lightly spray a large bowl with nonstick spray. Scrape the dough into the bowl, and cover tightly with plastic. Set the dough in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 60-90 minutes.If your oven has a bread-proofing setting, you can use that to proof your dough. If not, let your oven preheat to the lowest setting, turn the oven off, and then set your dough inside to rise., Set the bowl of dough, still covered, in the refrigerator, and chill for 2 hours, or preferably overnight.This rest period allows the gluten to rest and the dough to develop flavor. Also, since this is a very soft dough, it's extremely difficult to work with when it's not chilled. The cold dough is very easy to roll out, fill, roll up and cut., Use the remaining 1/4 cup of flour to flour your work surface, and turn the cold dough out onto the flour. Sprinkle the top of the dough with flour, too, and roll the dough out into a rectangle, roughly measuring 12x18 inches., Filling, Spread the dough all over with the soft butter, then spread with the apple butter.

To cut the dough, the easiest way is to use dental floss (unflavored). Just take a length of floss, slide it under the dough, then cross it over the top to cut through the dough. Cut the dough into 12 equal portions., Place the cut rolls in the muffin pan. Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap, and set in a warm place to rise just a little, until the dough fills the cups and is just starting to puff up., Preheat the oven to 350 F.

Mix thoroughly until the mixture is combined. Set aside until needed., Roll the dough into a 12 x 11-inch rectangle. Sprinkle the filling on top of the dough being sure to leave a border around the edges and press the filling down lightly to pack it on top of the dough., Starting on the long side of the dough, begin rolling the dough to the opposite side, creating a 12-inch log. Press tightly as you roll, until you reach the other side. Pinch the seam closed and lay the log seam side down. Cut into 8 even pieces, and transfer each roll to the prepared pie/cake pan., Brush with roughly two tablespoons (30g) of brown butter then bake for 18-20 minutes, until golden brown and puffed up.

So grab one side of the dough, and fold it up and into the center of the dough, hold it in the center, then rotate the dough and continue to do this all the way around. Flip the dough over so that seam is on the bottom. Recover and rest for 45 minutes on the counter., After 45 minutes, repeat the dough folding, then turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, seam side down. Use the sides of your hands and pinkies to gently pull the dough towards you, tucking the sides underneath as you roll. This will help to create a round shape and surface tension which helps achieve the best texture in the dough. Place the dough back into the bowl seam side down and recover. Place in the fridge overnight, 8-12 hours., The next morning, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough into two equal halves. Put one half back into the bowl and cover it.

Combine the filling light brown sugar, cane sugar, and cinnamon, in a small bowl. Set aside, Warm the milk in a small pot to between 105-115°F (if you go over, let it cool until the temperature is within that range). Transfer to a wide mixing bowl and mix in 1 teaspoon sugar. Slowly sprinkle the yeast over the warm milk and use a spoon to mix completely. Let set aside for 10 minutes while the yeast activates and foams. If your yeast hasn't foamed up after 10 minutes, you may have bad yeast and you should try again with a new packet., In a medium bowl, whisk together the tapioca starch, oat flour, sorghum flour, sweet rice flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. Set aside., In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer, combine 4½ tablespoons melted butter, remaining ¼ cup + 3 tablespoons sugar, and apple cider vinegar and mix until smooth. Add the egg and mix until completely incorporated.

Change to the dough hook and knead the dough on low for 1 minute. Let it rest for 1 minute. Knead again for one minute. Repeat 2x. The dough will be very sticky (more so than gluten yeast dough), but if you pinch a tablespoon of dough off an set it on the surface, it should hold its shape. If it doesn't, add 2-4 more tablespoons of tapioca starch until it's a little less soft and holds its shape., Sprinkle your surface with tapioca starch. Using a tapioca starch covered hands or spoon, scrape the dough out onto the surface and sprinkle it well with tapioca starch on top too. Roll your dough out to an 11x16 rectangle., Brush the dough with 4 tablespoons of the filling butter, reserving 1/2 tablespoon for brushing on top. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar filling over the surface., Starting with the long edge, tightly roll up the dough into a spiral. I use a bench scraper to help me roll it to make sure it doesn't stick to the surface. If you need to add more tapioca starch on the spiral as you roll, that's fine! It will just make your filling a little gooier, which, in my opinion is good., Tap in the edges so they're flat or cut the edges off and use a ruler to divide your log into 9 equal pieces (about 1.75 inches long). Cut into spirals using one of two methods: 1. Use uncoated dental floss or 2. A serrated knife with very gentle back and forth movements and no downward pressure. Place your cut rolls face up in the prepared pan. Brush tops with remaining butter. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm draft-free place for 1.5 hours until it has doubled in size and the cinnamon rolls are kissing each other. I let mine rise in the ""proof"" setting of my oven. If making ahead, you can also put them in the fridge to rise overnight in lieu of the 1.5-hour rise. Note: Your rolls WILL appear cracked on the top. This is normal and okay because it affects the taste None and you're definitely going to cover that up with icing., If you chilled your cinnamon rolls overnight, remove them from the fridge and allow them to sit on the counter for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Bake the rolls for 40-45 minutes, until they're firm to the touch (and if you have a meat thermometer, the bottom third of the rolls reads at least 205°F.)., While the rolls bake, prepare the glaze. Mix the cream cheese and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer until smooth. Add the powdered sugar and salt and mix until combined. Add 1 tablespoon milk and the vanilla extract. Add more milk as desired until you get your desired consistency. I make mine halfway between thick frosting and drizzle-able icing., When the rolls come out of the oven, cover them in icing and serve warm! Cinnamon rolls are best served warm fresh out of the oven and will become more dense the longer you wait.

Don't miss the edges., Starting at the long end, roll the dough up tightly into a log. Cut into 12 equal pieces. Place each piece, cinnamon side up, into a greased 9""x13"" baking pan. Cover with a towel and let it rise in a warm place again for 30 minutes., When there are 10 minutes left, preheat your oven to 375°F., Once your rolls have risen to almost double in size, pour over heavy cream.

If they are getting too brown and still need more time to cook, place a sheet of foil over the top., While they are baking, make the frosting by whisking the powdered sugar, butter, vanilla, and milk. If you want cream cheese frosting (which I highly recommend) leave out the milk and add 6 ounces of softened cream cheese. I would also use a hand mixer because it's easier., Once your cinnamon rolls are ready.

Beat vigorously for 2 minutes., Gradually add flour, ¼ cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface., Knead, adding flour a little at a time, until you have a smooth, elastic dough., Put the dough in an oiled bowl. Turn to coat the entire ball of dough with oil. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until doubled, about one hour., While the dough is rising, prepare the syrup by melting 2 tablespoons of the butter in a small saucepan. Add ¾ cup brown sugar and the corn syrup and stir to combine. Over medium heat, bring the mixture to a boil. Immediately remove from the heat and divide evenly into two well-seasoned 9-inch round pans. Set aside., Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and roll into an 18 by 24-inch rectangle. Brush with melted butter for filling. Leave ½ inch along one of the short edges with no butter or filling to make it easier to seal after rolling. Sprinkle the dough with cinnamon and brown sugar. Roll the dough toward the unfinished edge to form an 18-inch cylinder. Pinch the loose edge to the cylinder., Cut the cylinder into 16 equal pieces (they'll be a little over an inch wide). I find the best way to cut rolled breads so they keep their shape is with plain, unwaxed, dental floss. Cut off a piece of floss about 14 inches long. Wrap the floss around the index finger on both hands. Pull the floss taut. Lightly score the top of the cylinder with the floss so you know where to cut the rolls. Slip the floss under the roll where it is scored. Bring the ends of the floss up, cross them, and pull straight out to the sides. Presto, the perfect cut. Place 8 rolls in each pan on top of the syrup with the cut side up., Cover with a towel and let rise until almost doubled, about 50 minutes., Preheat the oven to 350 degrees., Bake for 25 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the rolls reaches 190 degrees, Let the rolls cool in the pan for 3 minutes.

Sprinkle the yeast into the warm milk and mix to disperse. Then set it aside in a warm place for about 10 - 15 minutes. The yeast should create a foam in the milk if active., Once the yeast is activated, add 100 g sugar, 2 eggs, 1 tbsp vanilla, then the 500 g flour, and salt. (If using weight measurements, you can place the bowl on the scale and add each ingredient until you have the right amount. Remember to tare the scale between ingredients)., Using a spatula, mix these ingredients until you get a scraggly dough., In your stand mixer, knead the dough with your hook attachment for about 2 minutes. If the dough is too dry, add upto another 1 tbsp of water., Next add the butter and knead the dough on low speed until it's completely incorporated into the dough. Once the butter has mixed in, knead the dough for a further 15 - 20 minutes until the dough is smooth and satiny. (The dough needs a long kneading time to develop the gluten well because it's an enriched dough. The dough should be slightly tacky, look smooth and have a little sheen, or look satiny.), Form a smooth dough ball and let the dough proof in the mixer bowl, covered with plastic wrap, for 1 ½ - 2 hours, until it has doubled in size. It will take less time during summer months, and more in the winter., While the dough is proofing, prepare the frosting and filling (instructions below). Line a 9 x 13 inch baking pan with parchment paper and set aside., Frosting, Place the softened cream cheese, salt and vanilla in a bowl. Whisk the cream cheese until nice and smooth with no lumps., Sift in the confectioner's sugar and whisk it in until you have a smooth frosting. Scrape the frosting into a small bowl with a lid, or into a ziploc bag and set aside. You can keep it at room temperature for up to 24 hours, or in the fridge for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for longer., Filling, In the same bowl that you made the frosting in, place the softened butter and salt. Whisk until the butter is smooth. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg and whisk until you have a smooth cinnamon butter., Place the filling in a microwavable dish and set aside until needed. If the filling hardens, microwave it for a few seconds to soften it. DO NOT let the filling melt in the microwave., Shaping the cinnamon rolls, Butter and line a 9 x 13 baking pan. Set it aside., Turn the proofed dough out onto a well floured surface, with the smooth side facing down. Roll out the dough into a square that's 13 - 14 inches. Try to make the dough as evenly thick as possible., Spread the cinnamon butter filling evenly on the dough square, leaving a ¾ inch margin along one edge. Lightly brush the margin with a little water., Roll up the dough towards the end with the ¾ inch margin. Make sure to roll it up snugly (not too loose, not too tight). Pinch the seam to seal the dough., Optionally, you can trim off the two ends once rolled up (since there's less filling at the ends, but this is not necessary)., Then, cut the cinnamon roll log into 12 equal pieces. First cut the log in half. Then cut each half in half. Cut each of these portions into 3 equal pieces to get a total of 12 pieces. Use a sharp knife with a back and forth motion to cut the 12 pieces, OR use a cotton string to cut the portions. If using a cotton string, slide it along the bottom of the cinnamon roll log, then cross the two ends over at the top where you want to make the cut, and then pull the two ends of the string to section off portions of the dough., Place the cut pieces of cinnamon rolls in the parchment paper-lined baking pan, with space between the rolls to allow for proofing., Tightly cover the baking pan with plastic wrap, and leave it in the fridge overnight or for up to 48 hours., Baking the cinnamon rolls, Preheat oven to 350°F / 180°C. Let the cinnamon rolls come to room temperature while the oven preheats., When the oven is preheated, cover the pan with foil and bake the cinnamon rolls in the covered pan for about 30 - 35 minutes. The cinnamon rolls should be nice and puffed up., Then remove the foil, and bake the rolls for a further 15 - 20 minutes until they turn light golden brown in color., Remove the buns from the oven and immediately spread frosting on top.

Set aside as you prep each group of ingredients. Prep your pan, I recommend using a 9x13"" square pan or a round pan that will fit 9 rolls easily.

Whisk in between every 20 seconds. It will thicken. Set it aside to cool slightly., First Dough Mixing- For the initial steps for making the dough, attach the paddle to your stand mixer and combine the starter, milk, and vanilla on low speed until the starter mostly dissolves. Add in the eggs, one at a time on low speed. Mix until combined. Add about 2 ½ cups of the flour mixture and all the yeast, slowly into the dough while the mixer is on the lowest setting.

Let the dough rest for about twenty minutes at room temperature., Finish mixing & kneading - After 20 minutes, switch to a dough hook attachment, turn the mixer on the lowest setting, and add in the sugar and salt. Add the butter a tablespoon at a time. Wait until the tablespoon is absorbed before adding it to the next one. Add in more flour a cup at a time, keeping the mixer on the lowest setting, until you get a ""shaggy"" dough. The dough ball should partially come clean from the sides of the bowl. It may appear slightly wet, but you should still be able to handle it. Mix on the lowest setting for about eight minutes. Dump the dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead for about a minute or two, until you feel it's smooth and easy to handle. Form into a round shape. Spray the stand mixer bowl with cooking spray well. Place the dough ball in the bowl. Cover with a clean, damp towel and plastic wrap. Let it sit out on the counter or in a warm room for about an hour., Fill & Cut – Uncover the bowl, and dump the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Lightly and gently pat out into a large rectangle. Place a few spoonfuls of the cinnamon/sugar mixture on top of the rectangle and use an offset spatula to spread evenly. Begin to roll the dough with the left side vertically. Make sure to roll it tightly but not too tight. I recommend using a food-grade string, twine, or even unflavored dental floss to cut the rolls out. Cut off the edge first with a bread knife. Place the string underneath the cinnamon roll, bring both sides of the string up, so they're parallel then cross them so they form an ""x"" until the string goes all the way through. Keep cutting out the rolls and place them into your prepared pan. Cover the pan with a damp towel and plastic wrap and set aside for another hour. If you are baking these the next day, at this point place them in the fridge covered well after they rested for another hour formed. If you're baking them the same day...continue to the instructions below., Prep oven and bake - If you placed them in the fridge to rest overnight, you'll have to let them come up to room temperature which can take a couple of hours. If you're baking the same day, you're ready to bake them after they rested for an hour as shaped rolls. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Once the oven is ready, turn the heat down to 375°F. Pour your heavy cream mixture into the pan and onto the rolls. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the rolls have risen and are golden brown. The internal temperature for the rolls should be about 190°F. If you're not sure if they're done, cut into one of the centers and see if the dough is fully cooked., Cool and Glaze - While the rolls are baking, make your glaze by combining all your ingredients and mixing until smooth. Once the rolls are cooked, allow them to cool for 10 minutes before pouring your glaze on top. You may have to re-stir the glaze occasionally to keep it from getting stiffer as it sits out.

Scrape the dough off the sides of the bowl and pour approximately on tablespoon of vegetable oil all around the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough over in the bowl so it is covered with the oil.

Just dump it in there!, Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment and mix until incorporated and no lumps remain. Switch to the dough hook. Mix on medium for 3-4 minutes. The dough will pull away from the sides of the bowl and you will be able to pull a window pane. It is a stickier dough but don’t be dissuaded., Turn out into a bowl sprayed with cooking spray. Give the dough one series of fold. Starting on one side, pull the dough up and fold it halfway towards the center. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn and repeat with each side until you have a little dough packet. Turn it seam-side down. The top should be smooth.

When it has doubled it is done!, You can also proof the dough in the refrigerator. This is called “retarding” the dough. It will make it proof slower but the cold dough will be easier to work with., Make the Filling:, While the dough proofs, make the filling. In a bowl, mix together butter, sugar and cinnamon. Mix until a paste forms. Set aside., Assemble the Cinnamon Rolls:, Cover your counter generously with flour and turn out your dough onto the counter. A bowl scraper or rubber spatula helps here because the dough is sticky. Sprinkle a generous amount of flour on top of the dough and flour a rolling pin., Roll the dough out into a rectangle 12 inches long by 10 inches high. (Try to keep those sharp corners! It’s harder than it looks but it’s good to have goals, right?) Once you have your rectangle, spread your filling with an offset spatula. Sometimes it is necessary to let your fingers join the party to help spread/hold the dough. I purposefully keep a border on the top and the bottom edge., Starting at the bottom edge (12 inches across) start to roll away from you. Seal the top edge. Cut approximately 1 inch pieces with a knife (or your bench scraper). This makes 12 rolls. You can also cut the log into 8 equal pieces for larger rolls., Spray a 9 “ x 11” baking dish with cooking spray and then place the cinnamon rolls about 2 inches apart. I offset them so I have a row with 2 and then one in the center followed by another row of 2 and so on. This gives them space to proof and grow without crowding., Final Proof:, Cover with plastic wrap and place back in your warm spot to proof an additional 20-40 minutes. I proofed 20 and then remove the dish to another spot and preheat my oven to 350°F convection. The smaller rolls will proof and bake faster than 8 larger ones., Bake, Remove the plastic wrap and bake 350°F for approximately 15-20 minutes. Mine baked 18. They will be golden brown around the edges and a bit on top and the centers will no longer look or feel doughy. You can also test with a cake tester. It should come out clean., Allow to cool before icing., Make the Icing & Frost:, Mix all the ingredients for the icing together. I find a spatula easier than a whisk to incorporate the cream cheese.

Prepare one large piping bag, fitted with a round tip, I used a 1/4” diameter tip. Also leave two piping bags set aside, without the end cut. Set aside., Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mat., Measure out all of the ingredients., Sift the powdered sugar, almond flour, cocoa powder, and cinnamon together. Set it aside. I am using cocoa powder to give the shells a tan color, since cinnamon rolls aren't white, they have a orange/light brown color. The cocoa powder is optional., Whisk the sugar and the egg white powder (if using) in a bowl, and place it over a pan with barely simmering water. Add the egg whites to the sugar and whisk the mixture until frothy and the sugar is completely melted. It will take a couple of minutes. You can test by touching the mixture between your fingers, and if you feel any sugar granules just keep whisking the mixture over the water bath., Make sure the bottom of the bowl isn’t touching the simmering water because you don’t want the whites to cook., Also, don’t overheat the sugar syrup, this may cause issues down the line, such as wrinkly macarons., Transfer the syrup to the bowl of a stand mixer., With the whisk attachment, start whisking the syrup on low for about 30 seconds, then gradually start increasing speed to medium. Whisk on medium for one to two minutes, until the mixture is white and starting to become fluffy. Raise the speed to high, or medium-high and whisk for a few minutes until stiff peaks are formed. Best way to check this is to keep your eye on the whites. Once they get glossy and you start seeing streaks formed by the whisk, it might be time to stop., Whisk until stiff peaks have formed. When you pull your whip up, the peak should be stiff and shooting straight up, with possibly a slight bend at the top, but not bending down to the side., Pour the sifted powdered sugar and almond flour into the stiff meringue., Start folding gently forming a letter J with a spatula., If making two different colors from the same batch, like I am for the Cinnamon Roll Macarons, fold the dry ingredients with the meringue just until you see no more dry ingredients in the meringue. If making just one color, ignore this and continue to fold the batter until the proper consistency is achieved. Which I will explain below how to identify. If making just one color batter, add the food coloring in the beginning., Anyway, back to the two colors batch. As soon as you see no more dry ingredients in the meringue, stop stirring. Divide the batter between two different bowls, I divided the batter like so: 2/3 of the batter for the white color, and 1/3 for the brown color., Work with one bowl at a time, leaving the other one covered meanwhile., To the first batter I didn’t add any color, so I just stirred it until the perfect consistency was achieved. Read below how to identify., Once that happens, transfer this first batter to one of the piping bags that doesn’t have the end cut. Secure the top with a tie, so the batter doesn’t scape while piping. Set the piping bag aside., Now, it’s time to work with the second batter. I added brown food coloring. After adding food coloring, stir until the perfect consistency is achieved., How to know when to stop folding the batter: It’s time to stop folding when the batter is glossy and has a thick and flowing consistency. There are several ways to test this., First, pick up some batter with the spatula and try to draw a figure 8 with the batter that is dripping off the spatula. If you can form several 8 figures without the batter breaking up, that’s one indication that it might be ready., There’s another test you can do. I call it the Teaspoon test., Grab a teaspoon of batter and spoon onto the parchment paper or silicon mat. Wait a minute to see how it behaves., If the batter stays stiff, forming a point and doesn’t spread out, fold a little bit more, about 3 folds., Test again., Once the batter spreads out a bit and starts to look glossy and smooth on top, on the parchment paper, it’s ready., You don’t want your batter to be too runny either. So be careful not to over mix. It’s always best to under mix and test several times until the proper consistency has been achieved., When you hold the spatula with batter on top of the bowl and the batter falls off the spatula slowly but effortlessly the batter is ready. The batter will keep flowing off the spatula non-stop, but not too quickly., Transfer the brown batter to another piping bag, also without the end cut. And secure the top with a tie., Using a pair of scissors, snip the ends of each piping bag., Place the large piping bag fitted with the round tip (I used a 1/4” piping tip) in a cup, so this way the bag will be held open., Place the bags with the two different color batters inside the piping bag., Now position the piping bag over the center of the circle template, and start applying gentle pressure to release the batter, while making a circle motion. This motion will make the swirl. The size of the circle should be about 1.25” in diameter, or slightly smaller than the circle template. You can watch the video to see exactly how to do this technique. The video is on YouTube or on this page., Once you’ve piped as many circles as you could, bang the trays against the counter., Use a toothpick to pop any air bubbles on the surface of the shells., Let the trays sit for a while so the shells will dry out a little bit. I usually leave about 20-40 minutes, depending on how humid the day is. You’ll know they’re ready when you gently touch the surface of a macaron and it seems dry, and doesn’t stick to your finger., Pre-heat the oven to 300ºF., Bake one tray at a time., Bake for 5 minutes, rotate tray., I bake each tray for about 15 to 20 minutes., When baked, the macarons will have a deeper color and formed feet. If you try to move a macaron, it shouldn’t feel jiggly. If the macaron is still jiggly, keep baking., Remove from the oven and bake the other tray., Let the macarons cool down before proceeding with the filling., Cinnamon Cream Cheese Frosting, Start by sifting the powdered sugar with the cinnamon. Set it aside., Now, cream the softened cream cheese and butter together in the bowl of an electric mixer, for about 2 minutes, until light and fluffy., With the mixer off, add powdered sugar/cinnamon mixture to the bowl., Turn mixer on low to incorporate the powdered sugar with the cream cheese and butter., Once you see no streaks of dry powdered sugar, cream mixture on medium high for one minute., Add vanilla extract. Mix to combine., This frosting will store well in the fridge for up to 5 days, covered., Make sure to always leave your frosting covered. Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap, because otherwise, the surface will dry out and create a skin., To assemble, Place the frosting in a piping bag fitter with the tip of choice. I just used a round piping tip., Pipe a dollop of frosting on each bottom shell. Top with another shell., Let the macarons mature overnight before enjoying., Storage, These macarons will store well in the fridge for 4 to 5 days, or in the freezer for 1 to 2 months.","[('egg white powder', 4.0, 'grams'), ('granulated sugar', 100.0, 'grams'), ('egg whites', 100.0, 'grams'), ('almond flour', 105.0, 'grams'), ('powdered sugar', 105.0, 'grams'), ('cocoa powder', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('cinnamon powder', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('cream cheese', 85.0, 'grams'), ('unsalted butter', 42.5, 'grams'), ('powdered sugar', 113.0, 'grams'), ('cinnamon powder', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('vanilla extract', 0.25, 'tsp')]"

Set aside., In a separate large bowl, stir the egg(s), salt, sugar, and oil together until well blended., Make sure your water is hot, around 120 degrees. (If you don't have a culinary thermometer, this temperature should feel uncomfortable to the touch but not painful). Pour the hot water on top of the egg mixture, but don't stir it together yet. (We want to allow our flour and instant yeast to activate when being mixed with the hot water)., Immediately add the flour mixture on top of the hot water, and use a sturdy spatula to stir all of the ingredients together until a dough is formed and the ingredients are well blended. The dough will get firmer, stickier, and more difficult to stir as it thickens., There's no kneading of this dough, as we don't want to incorporate any additional flour, but we want to stir it until it gets stretchy. Leave the dough in the bowl, and continue to scrape the sides and stir the dough with your heavy-duty spatula for around 2-3 minutes, or until the dough is stretchy and uniform. It will be a very sticky dough., Allow the dough to rise at room temperature until double in size, around one hour., Loosely wrap the bowl in plastic wrap, and place the risen dough in the fridge overnight, for at least 4 hours but no more than 24 hours., Day One: Prepare Filling Ingredients, Stir together the brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your fingers to break apart any large brown sugar pieces, and to make sure the cinnamon is thoroughly mixed in. Wrap this mixture or place it in an air-tight container until Day Two., Whisk the Instant Clearjel and Flour together until well blended. Wrap or place in an air-tight container until Day Two., If you'd like, you may take your salted butter out of the fridge so that it is softened and ready to roll in the morning., Day Two: Prepare Pan, The 1 oz of melted butter for brushing will be used three times. First, brush the cake pan(s) generously with melted butter on the bottom, sides, and inner corners. 6 cinnamon rolls fit in a 9x13x2 pan, and 12 cinnamon rolls fit in an 11x15x2 pan., Day Two: Roll Out Cinnamon Rolls, Generously dust your counter with about 1/4 cup of flour., Scrape the risen refrigerated cinnamon roll dough on top of the dusted flour. Use your fingers to scrape out any stuck to the bowl and add it to the dough. The dough will be sticky. Avoid pressing the dough into itself or turning it into a ball--this will overwork the dough. We want to roll it out with very little shaping of the dough. Instead, just lightly dust any sticky portions of the dough, and press any sticky edges into the floured counter. Lightly press the dough into a rectangular shape before rolling (I recommend watching the classic cinnamon roll recipe video for a step by step video)., Roll out the dough into an 9-inch horizontal by 16-inch vertical rectangle. (A 1x batch will be tall and skinny. A 2x batch will be wider than it is tall as seen in the recipe video). Using extra flour only as needed, dust any parts of the dough with flour that sticks to the table or rolling pin., If your butter is firm, microwave it for a few seconds until softened but not melted. Mix your softened butter thoroughly with the prepared Instant Clearjel mixture. Immediately spread it onto the rolled-out dough. We mix this right before spreading so that it doesn't have time to thicken before spreading. Spread it evenly all the way to the very edge of the dough., Pour the prepared Brown Sugar/Cinnamon mixture on top of the butter and spread it evenly all the way to the very edge of the dough. Evenly sprinkle the chopped pecans all over the cinnamon mixture., Roll up the cinnamon dough tightly, curving the edges in slightly as you roll (watch the recipe video). This helps maintain a nice roll on the edges and prevents the cinnamon mixture from escaping. When you are left with one inch of dough, pull it up and pinch it tightly against the rolled dough, creating a pinched seam., Dust the seam with flour, and turn your dough so it is seam side down against the floured counter. Shape the roll of dough with your hands if needed so that it is even in thickness. Score the dough with a bench scraper, pastry divider, or knife into 6 rolls, then cut the rolls with a bench scraper or sharp knife., Place the cinnamon rolls into your prepared pan, with little room between each roll and 1/2 inch from the edge of the pan. Lightly press down on each roll so that the edges of each roll barely touch each other, and improve their round form if needed. (The cinnamon rolls will rise into whatever shape they are in now. So if you have some oval or misshapen rolls, use your hands to form the edges into a circle before they rise.), Brush the cinnamon rolls with melted salted butter, then allow to rise at room temperature until double in size, around one hour., Day Two: Bake the Cinnamon Rolls, Preheat oven to 350 degrees., Bake the risen cinnamon rolls in the preheated 350-degree oven on the middle or top rack for 12 minutes, then turn the oven down to 325 degrees. Bake for an additional 6-8 minutes for six cinnamon rolls in a 9x13 pan, or an additional 12-16 minutes for twelve cinnamon rolls in an 11x15 pan. The cinnamon rolls are done when they are golden brown, and the dough bounces back when you tap it lightly with your finger. Check several areas of the rolls for doneness., Make Maple Glaze, While the rolls bake, make the glaze. Melt the butter in the microwave in a large microwave safe bowl. Whisk in the maple extract, pure vanilla extract and powdered sugar. As you whisk, the glaze will get very thick. Slowly add the very hot water and whisk the glaze until it is smooth with no lumps. The glaze will thicken as it cools, so if it is too thick to drizzle when the cinnamon rolls are done, microwave the glaze in 20-30 second increments until it reaches a drizzling consistency., Brush the cinnamon rolls one last time with melted butter. Using a small whisk, drizzle the glaze onto each hot cinnamon roll., These cinnamon rolls are best served warm and have the best soft texture when eaten the same day they are baked.

Filling: spread the butter over the dough and then sprinkle sugar, lemon zest, and salt evenly over the dough leaving a 1 inch border at the top and bottom., Roll up the dough into a log starting with the longest side furthest from you. Granulated sugar is loose so some may spill out, it’s okay. Just gather as much of it as you can back into the rolls. Pinch seams of dough to seal. Cut the log crosswise into 8 equal slices using a sharp knife., Butter/spray a 9×13 inch baking pan. Arrange the slices with the cut side up in the pan. Cover with plastic wrap and transfer to refrigerator overnight, 8-12 hours. Alternatively, to make rolls on the same-day, allow rolls to rise again in a warm environment for another 1-2 hours until puffy and then bake., Remove from refrigerator and let rolls sit out to reach room temperature for 1 – 2 hours, until puffy, before baking. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Remove the plastic wrap and bake rolls until lightly golden brown, about 30 minutes. While lemon sweet rolls bake, prepare icing., Once rolls are done, immediately spread icing over rolls and serve. Enjoy!, Lemon Cream Cheese Icing:, Beat butter and cream cheese together until light and fluffy, about 3-5 minutes. Add powdered sugar and slowly add in milk and then lemon zest.

To do this, start to fold the edge closest to you a small pinch at a time using your thumb and index finger, until you have your first complete fold, then lightly press down with your fingers., Repeat this step over and over until you create a log, remembering to press the sides in every so often to keep them even and intact., If your dough is quite soft, dust some flour onto a long tray and place your log on top. Place it in the fridge for ten minutes to help harden the dough, making it easier to handle., After ten minutes, take the log out of the fridge, removing it from the tray and place it on the bench., Gently cut your log into 9 equal sized portions using either a serrated knife or piece of string. To help make the cinnamon rolls even, cut the log into 3 first and then each piece into 3 again., Line a square baking tin with baking (parchment) paper then place your portions of cinnamon rolls into the prepared tin, leaving a small gap between each one., Cover the tray entirely (all the way around) with plastic wrap to create a humid environment and leave to proof for 1 hour (If it’s a very warm humid day it may take a little less time, if it’s a very cold dry day it may take longer), In the meantime, preheat your oven to 170°C/338°F fan forced., When your cinnamon rolls are ready to bake, remove the plastic wrap, cover the tray with foil and bake for 20 minutes. This will help create a steamy environment which will allow your cinnamon rolls to expand and become fluffy., After this time, remove the foil from your cinnamon rolls and bake uncovered for a further 10 minutes., While the rolls are baking, stir together ingredients for the vanilla glaze in a bowl until smooth.

Line a baking tray with a baking mat or parchment paper., For the keto dough:, Add almond flour, coconut flour, xanthan gum, baking powder and salt to food processor. Pulse until thoroughly combined., Pour in apple cider vinegar with the food processor running. Once it has distributed evenly, pour in the egg. Followed by the water. Stop the food processor once the dough forms into a ball. The dough will be sticky to touch., Wrap dough in cling film and knead it through the plastic for a minute or two. Think of it a bit like a stress ball. Allow dough to rest for 10 minutes (and up to 5 days in the fridge)., For the keto cinnamon roll knots, Roll out the rested dough between two sheets of parchment paper with a rolling pin until roughly 10x10 inches in size. To get a perfect square, simply trim the uneven edges, patch them up and keep rolling until evenly sized., Assemble by brushing with melted butter and sprinkling with the cinnamon 'sugar' (to taste- we do 3TBS sweetener with 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon). Fold the dough in half and cut into 8-10 strips with a pastry cutter. Twist and roughly make into knots, pinching the dough together to seal closed (it'll naturally form into rounds as you twist). You can freeze the cinnamon roll knots at this point for a month or two, and bake straight from the freezer (adding a few more minutes in the oven)., Place the knots in prepared tray and bake for 8-12 minutes (we do 10), until they just begin to brown. You want to only bake them briefly so they stay moist and doughy, otherwise you'll get cookies (still good, but not ideal!)., While your cinnamon knots are in the oven. Cream together with an electric mixer the cream cheese and butter until light and fluffy. Beat in the powdered sweetener, vanilla extract and salt. If you want it more of a drizzling consistency, add a few teaspoons of almond milk to thin it out., These guys are best served warm straight from the oven, with a generous drizzle of cream cheese glaze.
