For best results and ease of mind, read through the recipe completely before beginning. You will need two deep dish 9×2-inch round cake pans if you are making both pizzas at the same time. You can also use 9-inch springform pans., For the crust, Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, and yeast in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. If you do not have a stand mixer, use your hand mixer and a very very large bowl. If you do not have any mixer, you will do this all by hand. Again, use a very large bowl. Give those ingredients a quick toss with your mixer on low or with a large wooden spoon. Add the warm water and 1/4 cup of melted butter. The warm water should be around 90°F (32°C). Make sure it is not very, very hot or it will kill the yeast. Likewise, make sure the butter isn’t boiling hot. If you melt it in the microwave, let it sit for 5 minutes before adding. On low speed, beat (or stir) the dough ingredients until everything begins to be moistened. Continuing on low speed (or remove from the bowl and knead by hand if you do not own a mixer), beat the dough until it is soft and supple and gently pulls away from the sides of the bowl and falls off of the dough hook- about 4-5 minutes. If the dough is too hard (it will be textured from the cornmeal), but if it feels too tough, beat in 1 teaspoon of warm water. Alternatively, if it feels too soft, beat in 1 Tablespoon of flour., Remove the dough from the bowl and form into a ball. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning it around so that all sides of the dough are coated in the oil. Cover the bowl tightly with aluminum foil and allow to rise in a warm environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size., Once the dough is ready, lightly flour a large work surface. Remove dough from the bowl, set the bowl and aluminum foil aside (to use later). Gently punch down the dough to remove any air bubbles and roll the dough into a large 15×12-inch rectangle. Spread 1/4 cup of softened butter on top of the dough. Roll it up lengthwise per the photos below. Cut the dough log in half. Form the two pieces of dough into balls and place back into your greased bowl. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rise in the refrigerator (not in a warm place) for 1 hour until they are puffy as you make the sauce., For the sauce, Place butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and allow it to melt. Once melted, add the grated onion, salt, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Once the onion has slightly browned after about 5 minutes, add the garlic, tomatoes, and sugar. Turn the heat down to low-medium and allow it to simmer until it’s hearty, fragrant, and thick- about 30 minutes. You’ll have about 2 and 1/2 cups of sauce at this point. If you have more than that, keep simmering until the amount has reduced. Remove from heat and set aside until ready to be used. You may store the sauce in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days if planning to make the pizza another day. You may freeze this sauce for up to 2 months as well., Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C)., Assemble the pizzas, After the dough balls have risen in the refrigerator, they should be puffy. Keep one ball of dough in the refrigerator as you work with the first one. Roll it out on a lightly floured work surface, working it into a 12-inch circle. Using your rolling pin as a guide (see photos below), place over a 9×2-inch deep dish cake pan. Using your fingers, press the dough into the cake pan. Make sure it is nice and tight fitting inside the pan. Trim any excess dough off the edges with a small knife. Repeat with 2nd dough. Brush the top edges of the dough with a little olive oil, which gives the crust a beautiful sheen. Fill each pizza with 1/2 of the cheese (about 2 cups/8 oz per pizza), then the pepperoni and bacon or your desired toppings. Pour about 1 and 1/4 cups (300ml) of sauce evenly on top of each. If you do not like that much sauce, you can reduce to 3/4 cup (180ml) per pizza and have leftover sauce. Sprinkle each with 1/4 cup (22g) of grated parmesan cheese., Place the cake pans on top of a large baking sheet, which will catch anything potentially spilling over the sides of the pans. (Nothing usually does.) Bake for 20-28 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Feel free to loosely cover the pizzas with aluminum foil after the 15 minute mark to prevent any heavy browning and uneven baking. Remove the pizzas from the oven and allow to cool in the pans placed on a wire rack for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, slice, serve, and enjoy. Place any leftover pizza in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Reheat leftovers in a 300°F (149°C) oven for 15-20 minutes or until hot.","[('flour', 406.0, 'g'), ('cornmeal', 60.0, 'g'), ('salt', 1.25, 'tsp'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('yeast', 7.0, 'g'), ('water', 300.0, 'ml'), ('butter', 113.0, 'g'), ('olive oil', None), ('onion', None), ('salt', 0.75, 'tsp'), ('oregano', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('red pepper flakes', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('garlic', None), ('tomatoes', 794.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('mozzarella cheese', 16.0, 'oz'), ('parmesan cheese', 45.0, 'g'), ('pepperoni', None), ('bacon', None)]"

Add the water. Using a rubber spatula, mix until the liquid is absorbed and the ingredients form a sticky dough ball. Rub the surface of the dough lightly with olive oil. If your bowl has a lid, cover the bowl. Alternatively, transfer the dough to a vessel with a lid or cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to ensure the dough doesn’t dry out in the fridge., Transfer dough to the fridge for at least 18 hours but ideally longer: 24 to 48 hours. Longer is fine, too: I’ve kept the dough in the fridge for 3 days before proceeding., Grease a 12″ x 18″ sheet pan with butter. Pour 2 tablespoons of olive oil into the center of the pan. (Note: This greasing step may seem excessive, but with some pans, it is imperative to do so to prevent sticking. Moreover, it adds flavor and helps brown the bottom crust perfectly.), Remove the dough from the fridge and use lightly oiled hands to release it from the sides of the bowl. Then, again with oiled hands, grab an edge of dough and pull up and to the center. Turn the bowl slightly and repeat until you’ve shaped the dough into a rough ball., Place the dough ball in the pan and turn to coat. (Note: You do not need to cover the dough here. The coating of oil should be sufficient to prevent the dough from drying out.) Let rest for 3 hours. With lightly oiled hands, stretch the dough to fit the pan — tent your hands, and use your fingers to dimple and stretch. You will likely not be able to get the dough to stretch all the way to the edges. When the dough resists, let it rest again for 30 minutes; then stretch it again using the same technique., At this point, the dough can hang out in the pan for a couple of hours (if your kitchen is on the cool side). I’ve baked it 30 minutes after this point, and I’ve baked it two hours later. If the dough is going to hang out for a while, cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap., If you have a Baking Steel or pizza stone, place it on a rack in the middle or lower third of your oven, and heat your oven to 500ºF., Using oiled hand, dimple the dough one last time with the exception of the perimeter — this is important. It will help the dough bake more evenly., Transfer pan to the oven and place on heated Baking Steel or pizza stone for about 10 to 11 minutes or until evenly golden., Remove pan from oven and lower the oven to 475ºF. (Note: my oven doesn’t change temperature so quickly, so I actually turn the oven off during this period. Just before I return the pan to the oven, I turn the oven back on to 475ºF. Also: You can do this parbake hours ahead of time or even a day ahead of time.), For the veggie pizza, In a large skillet over high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. When it shimmers, add the mushrooms and let cook undisturbed for about a minute. Season with salt; then stir. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until the mushrooms are beginning to brown. Transfer to a bowl. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the skillet; then add the peppers and mushrooms. Cook for 1 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Season with salt; then transfer to the bowl with the mushrooms. Toss to combine. Taste and adjust with salt as needed. Spread this mixture over the cheese.

If you are using the hot honey for the pickled jalapeño pizza, drizzle some over the top., Run a knife or spatula around the pan’s edges.

Don’t pat in the center of the dough, or you’ll get limp pizza. Really focus on staying outside of the center and work toward the edge. After you work the dough, grab the edge of the pizza and lift it in the air. Allow it to quickly hang down and keep rotating the pizza crust through your fingers to allow the rest of the pizza to have a chance to hang like you’re turning the steering wheel of a car.

Form a claw with your hand and stir the yeast and water mixture, slowly incorporating flour into the wet mixture and creating a thicker and thicker paste., When the dough is shaggy, stir in olive oil., Once you have most of the dough formed, let it rest for 5 minutes. It'll look pretty dry, but it's totally normal., Now, add salt and knead the dough until smooth., Then turn the dough onto a lightly floured counter and cover with a bowl. Rest for 20 minutes., Divide the dough into 3 equal parts (about 250g each) and knead into smooth balls., Place the dough balls on a cookie sheet, lined with plastic wrap, and cover with plastic wrap. (Alternatively, you may place the dough balls in a plastic container with a lid, or plastic bags.), Refrigerate for at least 24 hours, or up to 3 days. (After cold fermentation, you can freeze the dough balls for up to 2 months.

Now, press forward with all of your fingertips over the top half of the circle until you reach the border, leaving dimples all over. Turn the dough over, and then press again from the center forward on the other half of the dough. This’s an important step! Pressing the dough with fingertips traps all the air bubbles inside the dough, so the crust is airy and light after baking., Now you can stretch the dough by pulling the dough with your hands, stretching, slapping or throwing up in air. (TIP: If the dough is resisting, your dough might be still cold. Let it rest a bit and try again.), If it’s getting too sticky, get a little bit of flour with only two fingers to dust.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a towel and let it sit at room temperature for 12-18 hours or until it has doubled in size., The next day:, Dust a work surface with flour. Punch the dough down and place it on the floured surface. Divide the dough into the number or pizzas you would like to make (two large, three medium, or four personal-size). Shape each portion of dough by pulling the right side towards the center of the mound, followed by the left side, then the top and bottom. Turn the dough over (seam side down) and shape it with your hands into a smooth circle. Dust the mounds with flour as needed during the shaping process. The dough should not be sticky., At this point, you can use the dough right away, or wrap the rounds individually in plastic wrap, refrigerate, and enjoy within 3 days. Place refrigerated rounds of dough on a floured work surface and cover with a towel to let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before using (which is a good amount of time to let your pizza stone heat up)., Making the pizza:, Preheat a pizza stone in the upper third of your oven at 550°F., Carefully stretch the dough with your hands at a floured sheet of parchment paper to the desired size (depending on the size of your dough mound). See this video for reference on stretching. If your dough stretches out unevenly, you can use a floured rolling pin to even things out. Use a rolling pin gently and minimally though, as it presses out all the air bubbles that leaven your crust during baking., Top each pizza with a light layer of the pesto. Tear a ball of fresh mozzarella with your hands and place pieces of the cheese on the sauce. Follow with prosciutto, tearing it into pieces, then the sliced strawberries., Turn the preheated oven off and set the broiler on HIGH. Cut the parchment paper with scissors so that it just comes to the very edge of your crust (so that the edges of the paper don’t burn in the oven). Flip a baking sheet upside down and use tongs to carefully transfer the pizza to the flat side of the baking sheet. Slide the pizza from the baking sheet onto the pizza stone and cook the pizza for 3-6 minutes, watching carefully, until it is lightly browned and bubbly on top with black char spots.

Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment, and mix on low speed for 5 minutes to make a wet dough, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add 1/2 cup more of 00 flour. Switch to the dough hook, increase the mixer speed to medium, and knead for 7 minutes, adding more flour by the tablespoon until dough comes away from the sides of the bowl. After 7 minutes, the dough should feel smooth and soft, and slightly sticky, but not too wet., Place the dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl or container, and cover tightly with plastic wrap or a lid. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled or tripled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. (Alternately, let it rise in the fridge overnight.), Prepare the toppings:, In a small saucepan, stir together the balsamic and honey. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and continue to simmer, swirling occasionally, until thick, syrupy and reduced by about half, about 5 minutes. Pour into a small, heat-proof bowl, let cool, then chill in the fridge to thicken. (The reduction will keep in the fridge for probably a long time.), Slice the tops and bottoms off the figs and cut them into 1/4"" slices. Rinse the arugula and spin it dry. Have the other ingredients at the ready., Assemble and bake the flatbreads:, Position a rack in the bottom of the oven, and remove any other racks from the oven. If you have a baking stone, place it on the rack. (Lacking a stone, place an inverted, heavy baking sheet in the oven, or just form the pizza directly onto a baking sheet in the following steps.) Preheat the oven to 500º for at least 30 minutes., Scrape the risen dough out onto a lightly-floured surface. Divide the dough into three balls, and keep the other two covered while you work with the first. On a lightly floured surface, tuck the edges of the dough under itself to make a loose ball, then flatten the dough into a disc. Gently press, pull and stretch the dough into a 10-12"" round; if it is very springy, let it rest for a few minutes to relax the glutens., Place the dough on a piece of parchment paper set on a pizza peel (or large cutting board). Trim the edges of the parchment so they stick out 1"" on all sides. Brush the dough all over with olive oil. Crumble the goat cheese evenly over the dough, going right to edges, then top with an even layer of the grated parmesan. Place the fig slices evenly over the cheese and press them down gently., Slip the pizza on its parchment onto the hot baking stone in the oven. Bake the pizza until the bottom of the crust is golden, the figs are roasted and the cheese is beginning to color, about 8-12 minutes., Use a pair of tongs to pull the flatbread from the oven and onto a large cutting board.

Put them into a tray then cover them too and leave to prove for another 4-6hr., STEP TWO: STRETCHING THE CLASSIC PIZZA MARGHERITA BASE, Spread some flour over the top of your board., Get one of the balls out from the tray using a small amount flour on the sides to prevent it from sticking – to your hands and the tray – and place it on the bench., This dough is very elastic so will stretch easily. Start to create the round base by working your fingertips from the bottom all the way up, making sure to leave a 1cm rim all around the edges., Turn the pizza upside down and repeat the process. This pushes all the air to the bottom and into the crust., Repeat this – gently – twice on each side, then lift the base, flip it into one hand and onto the bench, helping it to stretch further and form a circle., STEP THREE: MAKING THE CLASSIC PIZZA MARGHERITA, To make an authentic pizza margherita, you need to use QUALITY ingredients for your toppings!, Start by pouring a tin of san Marzano peeled tomatoes into a bowl.

I shoot for something around 110F in order to active the yeast. Yeast needs to be activated for it to have any chance in helping dough rise. If your water is not hot enough, it will not work and if your water is too hot (120F+) it will start to kill the yeast. If you don’t have a thermometer that’s okay, I usually just run the water until it’s luke-warm, not cold but also not hot enough to wash dishes, you want that annoying warm water that makes you think your water will never get hot.In your measuring cup, add in the sugar and yeast- just sprinkle on top of the water (see picture below), Let this sit for 5 minutes. The sugar will feed the yeast. Think of it this way, the warm water will wake up your yeast and the sugar is like it’s morning coffee, which is much needed before taking on the day of hard work (in this case, making pizza crust dough rise)., Now it’s time to mix the ingredients together. I use a kitchen aid mixer with a dough hook. Kneading is an important step to the dough – scientifically, kneading helps the gluten strands grow making the dough rise. The benefit to a dough hook is that it helps to knead the dough, but this can also be by hand. I have step-by-step kneading pictures in another pizza crust recipe.In your bowl, add in the flour, salt and your water with the activated yeast., Start mixing it together, make sure to turn your mixer on slowly so that flour doesn’t pop out of your bowl. As it starts to come together you can turn the speed up faster., While the mixer is still running, add in the TBSP of olive oil., Let it mix for about 5 minutes. The high speed will also knead the dough for you. Sometimes it will form into a ball and other times it looks like this. If you get this, you can use your hands to form a ball, it should stick together pretty easily., Drizzle a little olive oil in your bowl, and coat the sides. I use my hand to smear the oil around. Then place the ball of dough back in the bowl., Cover it with a clean kitchen towel, place it is a warm area in your kitchen and let it rise.If you're making this ahead of time and not using it today, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise in the refrigerator for 24-48 hours. (This is my preferred method), It will take about an hour to double in size., At this point, you will want to punch the dough down and divide in half.If you plan on freezing one of the doughs, then shape it into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap or place in a large ziplock bag, try to remove as much air as possible - label and freeze., Preheat your oven to 425F and if you’re using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to warm up as the oven preheats. If you’re using a sheet pan, no need to preheat it., I sprinkle the counter with corn meal to help prevent it from sticking and it will help create a crispier crust. Roll it out, until it’s about 1/4 inch thick, you may want to turn it between rolls to make it a circle shape., Sprinkle corn meal on your pre-heated pizza stone or sheet pan. Place your rolled out dough on the stone or pan.Drizzle with a little of olive oil, this helps the crust from becoming soggy from the toppings., Add your toppings.For the pizza here, I sprinkled on about 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced onions, red peppers, and pepperoni., Bake at 425F for 10-12 minutes.","[('water', 1.25, 'cup'), ('yeast', 1.0, 'packets'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('flour', 4.0, 'cups'), ('salt', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('olive oil', 1.0, 'tbsp')]"

If you followed my pizza dough recipe, you will have 2 balls of dough. If you want to make them both right away, be sure to double the topping ingredients shown here. Place a pizza stone in the bottom third of your oven. (place a rimmed baking sheet or a pizza pan in the oven if you don't have a stone.), Preheat your oven to 550 degrees F, or as high as it will go (at least 475.) Let the stone preheat for 30 minutes. I don't care when your oven beeps to tell you it's at temperature. Set a timer, 30 minutes at least!, Prepare a work surface. I prefer to rub my counter with oil, but you can lightly dust it with flour if you have a very sticky dough. (Too much flour can turn your dough tough.), Roll out the dough. Place your ball of pizza dough in the center of your prepared work surface and use your hands to press it down, starting from the center. Keep gently patting out the dough, moving the dough outward from the center. I usually use my hands for pizza dough, gently patting and stretching (and yes, picking it up and maybe even tossing!), but you can also use a rolling pin. Make sure to keep rotating the pin so that you get a roughly circular shape. It doesn't have to be perfect! Even if you have used a rolling pin, I like to use my fingers afterward to shape the edges into a thicker crust. See photos. Continue patting and stretching the dough gently with your hands until it is about 12 inches across., Transfer the dough to a square of parchment paper. I highly recommend using parchment paper because it’s SO much easier transferring your pizza into the oven. You can pick it up carefully with your hands and rearrange it on the paper, or wrap it around your rolling pin to help transfer. (I've tried rolling the dough out directly onto parchment paper. It doesn't work well.) Make sure you stretch out the dough so that it is about 12 inches.Drizzle about a tablespoon of olive oil over the top of your dough. Use your hands or a pastry brush to rub the oil all over the top of the dough, especially the edges of the crust. This layer of oil helps provide a barrier between the toppings and the dough, helping it cook more evenly.If you love a thicker crust pizza, let the rolled-out dough rest for 10 minutes. You can skip this rest no problem., Par bake. Once the oven is up to temperature, we are going to do a 1 to 2 minute par bake. This step is technically not necessary, but I never skip it. It guarantees not only a thoroughly cooked crust, but a nice and crispy one. Nobody wants a doughy pizza, yuck. (If you want to skip it, you can proceed with topping your pizza). Pulling on the edge of the parchment paper, slide your pizza dough onto your pizza peel or flat baking sheet. Open the oven and pull on the parchment paper again to slide the pizza dough and the parchment paper onto the hot hot pizza stone (or pizza pan). Your whole body is basically inside the oven during this procedure so please be careful and make sure there are no toddlers running around who could climb right in and burn to death (these are the thoughts that keep me up at night).Shut the oven door and par bake for 1-2 minutes, until the dough is slightly puffed. Set a timer, don't walk away!Pull on the parchment paper again to transfer the half-baked dough back onto your pizza peel. Keep the oven door shut as much as possible so you don't lose heat. Poke down any large bubbles on your crust., Top your pizza. Leave the crust on the peel while you add your toppings. Add 1 cup of pizza sauce (I like to spread it around with a ladle). Add 3 ounces thinly sliced mozzarella, and then top with 5 ounces of shredded mozzarella. I like a lot of cheese and this is about the max amount you can add without weighing down your pizza so much that it doesn't cook all the way through. This isn't the Bible, you can eyeball the amounts on cheese, just keep in mind there is a limit if you want a properly cooked pizza. Add about a half package of pepperoni (or olives, mushrooms, ham and pineapple, sausage, red onions, or literally any toppings you want. See post for ideas.) Sprinkle 2 tablespoons shredded parmesan cheese over your toppings., Bake the pizza. (See note if you don't have a pizza stone*) Transfer the pizza back onto the pizza stone (or pan), this time without the parchment paper. You want the pizza to do its final bake directly on the stone. (The stone is porous and absorbs moisture, giving you a crispier crust.) Your crust is sturdy enough after the 1-2 minute par bake that it shouldn't be too hard to push the pizza onto the stone without the paper. Bake the pizza for about 8-12 minutes. This is going to depend on how hot your oven is, and how thick your pizza is. The edges of the crust should be golden brown, and the cheese should be bubbly and also starting to lightly brown. If you don't have a pizza stone, use a spatula to lift the edge of your pizza to make sure that it is browning all across the center on bottom. If the bottom is still white, you are looking at a doughy pizza. No thanks. Leave it in longer.If the top of your pizza is browning too quickly but the bottom crust isn't done, tent the top of the pizza with foil to slow browning., Remove your pizza from the oven using the pizza peel. Slide it directly onto a cooling rack to help keep that bottom crust from getting soggy. Let cool a couple minutes, then transfer to a cutting board.

Add the warm water and olive oil, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together. It will seem shaggy and dry, but don’t worry., Scrape the dough onto a well-floured counter top and knead the dough for three minutes. It should quickly come together and begin to get sticky. Dust the dough with flour as needed (sometimes I will have to do this 2 to 3 times, depending on humidity levels) – it should be slightly tacky, but should not be sticking to your counter top. After about 3 minutes, the dough should be smooth, slightly elastic, and tacky. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil, and place the dough into the bowl., Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or plastic wrap) and allow the dough to rise in a warm, dry area of your kitchen for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size. Proofing Tip: If your kitchen is very cold, heat a large heatproof measuring cup of water in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. This creates a nice warm environment. Remove the cup and place the bowl with the dough in the microwave until it has risen. [If you are preparing the dough in advance, see the note section for freezing instructions.], Preheat Oven and Pizza Steel or Stone: Place the pizza steel (or stone) on the second to top rack of your oven (roughly 8 inches from the broiler element), and preheat the oven and steel (or stone) to 550°F (285°C) for a minumum of 1 hour. If your oven does not go up to 550°F (285°C) or you are using a delicate pizza stone, I recommend heating it to a maximum of 500°F (260°C), As the oven is preheating, assemble the ingredients. In a small bowl, stir together the pureed tomatoes, minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pepper, and salt. Set aside another small bowl with the cubed mozzarella cheese (pat the cheese with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture). Set aside the basil leaves and grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese for easy grabbing., Separate the dough into two equal-sized portions. It will deflate slightly, but that is OK. Place the dough on a large plate or floured counter top, cover gently with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes., Assemble the Pizza: Sprinkle the pizza peel (if you do not own a pizza peel, you can try using the back of a half sheet pan - but it is tricky!) with a tablespoon of semolina and dusting of all-purpose flour. Gently use both hands to stretch one ball of pizza dough into roughly a 10-inch circle (don’t worry if its not perfectly uniform). If the dough springs back or is too elastic, allow it to rest for an additional five minutes. The edges of the dough can be slightly thicker, but make sure the center of the dough is thin (you should be able to see some light through it if you held it up). Gently transfer the dough onto the semolina and flour dusted pizza peel or baking sheet., Drizzle or brush the dough lightly (using your fingertips) with olive oil (roughly a teaspoon. Using a large spoon, add roughly ½ cup of the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, leaving a ½-inch or ¾-inch border on all sides. Use the back of the spoon to spread it evenly and thinly. Sprinkle a tablespoon of parmigiano-reggiano cheese onto the pizza sauce. Add half of the cubed mozzarella, distributing it evenly over the entire pizza. Using your hands, tear a few large basil leaves, and sprinkle the basil over the pizza. At this point, I’ll occasionally stretch the sides of the dough out a bit to make it even thinner. Gently slide the pizza from the peel onto the heated baking stone. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and caramelized and the edges of the pizza are golden brown. Note: If you're looking for more color, finish the pizza under the low or medium broil setting, but watch it carefully! Remove the pizza carefully from the oven with the pizza peel, transfer to a wooden cutting board or foil, drizzle the top with olive oil, some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and chiffonade of fresh basil. Slice and serve immediately and/or prepare the second pizza., Serving Tip: If you’re serving two pizzas at once, I recommend placing the cooked pizza on a separate baking sheet while you prepare the other pizza. In the last few minutes of cooking, place the prepared pizza into the oven (on a rack below the pizza stone) so that it is extra hot for serving. Otherwise, I recommend serving one pizza fresh out of the oven, keeping the oven hot, and preparing the second pizza after people have gone through the first one!

(UPDATE: In the past I have recommended letting the dough rise until it doubles in volume. If you’ve had success with this, continue to let the dough double. Recently, I have been stopping the bulk fermentation when the dough increases by 50% in volume, and I feel my dough is even stronger in the end.) Note: Do not use your oven with the light on for the bulk fermentation — it is too warm for the dough. When determining when the bulk fermentation is done, it is best to rely on visual cues (doubling in volume) as opposed to time. A straight-sided vessel makes monitoring the bulk fermentation especially easy because it allows you to see when your dough has truly doubled., Portion and shape, Turn the dough out onto a work surface and shape into a rough ball, using as much flour as needed — the dough will be sticky. Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Sprinkle portions with flour. With floured hands, roll each portion into a ball, using the pinkie-edges of your hands to pinch the dough underneath each ball. Transfer each round of dough to a plastic quart container, cover, and store in fridge for at least 6 hours or up to 3 days or transfer to the freezer (see notes in post about thawing)., Make the pizzas, Pull out a round (or more) of dough from the fridge one hour before you plan on baking. Dust dough with flour and place on a floured work surface. Let sit untouched for about an hour (a little longer or shorter is fine). Place a Baking Steel or pizza stone in the top third of your oven. Set oven to 550ºF. Heat oven for at least 45 minutes but ideally 1 hour prior to baking., Shape the dough, Gently shape dough into a 10-inch (roughly) round handling it as minimally as possible. (See video for guidance.) Lay a sheet of parchment paper on top of a pizza peel. Transfer the dough round to the parchment-lined peel., Top and Bake, To make a classic Margherita-style pizza, Spread 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce over the surface of the dough. Top with mozzarella to taste. Sprinkle with parmesan to taste. Drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt. Shimmy the pizza, parchment paper and all into the oven. Bake pizza until top is blistered, about 5-6 minutes. Transfer to cutting board. Sprinkle with basil, if you have it. Cut and serve. Discard parchment paper., To make a kale and crème fraîche pizza, Place the kale in a small bowl, drizzle with olive oil, season with sea salt, and toss. Spoon crème fraîche over the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border or so—I use about a tablespoon per pizza. Sprinkle with minced garlic and a handful of grated Parmigiano Reggiano. Top with the kale. Shimmy the pizza, parchment paper and all into the oven. Bake pizza until top is blistered, about 5 – 6 minutes. Transfer to cutting board. Cut and serve. Discard parchment paper., To make a naked pizza with scallion oil, Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a skillet with 1/4 cup of minced scallions (or ramps!) and 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes. Keep it over low heat while you make the pizza. Spoon crème fraîche over the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border or so—I use about a tablespoon per pizza. Sprinkle with a handful of grated parmesan. Shimmy the pizza, parchment paper and all into the oven. Bake pizza until top is blistered, about 5 – 6 minutes. Transfer to cutting board. At this point, the scallions should be starting to “frizzle”. If they aren’t, crank up the heat until the oil is sizzling. Spoon a few tablespoons of the hot oil over the pizza (you’ll have extra oil). Sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt. Cut and serve.","[('water', 375.0, 'grams'), ('sourdough starter', 100.0, 'grams'), ('salt', 10.0, 'grams'), ('flour', 500.0, 'grams'), ('tomato sauce', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('mozzarella', 2.0, 'ounces'), ('parmigiano reggiano', None, None), ('olive oil', None, None), ('kale', None, None), ('garlic', 2.0, 'cloves'), ('crème fraîche', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('parmigiano reggiano', '1/4', 'cup'), ('olive oil', '1/4', 'cup'), ('scallions', '1/4', 'cup'), ('crushed red pepper flakes', '1', 'teaspoon'), ('parmigiano reggiano', None, None), ('sea salt', None, None)]"

Then wait 10 minutes. If the mixture bubbles at the top and develops a yeasty aroma, the yeast is still alive active. If it does not, your yeast may not be active, meaning the dough will not rise., To the stand mixer bowl, add 2 cups of flour and a pinch of salt. Connect the hook attachment to the stand mixer and turn it on low speed. Slowly pour in water, yeast, sugar mixture to flour. Add 2 tbsp olive oil.

The plastic wrap will protect the dough from air exposure, which can harden the dough., Creating a Crispy Crust!, Dough should have risen after resting for at least 2 hours. To make a thin crispy crust for a pizza, heat the oven to 500 degrees F or 260 degrees C. Lightly flour a work surface. If you wish to have a ""pan"" style pizza, you will work and stretch the entire pizza ball in this recipe. If you enjoy thin crispy crust, divide the dough ball in half. Work one dough ball, and set the second aside (covered) to make another pizza., Work and stretch your ball into the desired size working from the inside out. Place pizza on a pan coated with olive oil. Take a fork and poke a few holes into the dough to prevent major air bubbles. Bake at 500 for 5-7 minutes to allow crust to crisp.

Set aside., In a very large bowl or 12-quart round tub, add the flour (7¾c.) and slowly add 3-4 cups of warm water in, just until the mixture comes together., Mix by hand just until incorporated. Cover and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes on your counter., Sprinkle the salt over the top of the dough. Then pour the yeast mixture over the dough. Use a small piece of the mixture to wipe the remaining yeast goop from its container, then throw it back in the tub., Bring the bowl next to the sink and turn on a slow trickle of warm water. Mix the dough by hand, wetting your working hand before mixing so the dough doesn’t stick to you. (It’s fine to rewet your hand three or four times while you mix.) Mix well until incorporated., Reach underneath the dough and grab about one-quarter of it. Gently stretch this section of dough and fold it over the top of the other side of the dough. Repeat three more times with the remaining dough, until the salt and yeast are fully enclosed., Fold the dough repeatedly, rotating and folding, working through the entire mass of dough. Do this for 5 minutes. Let rest for 30 minutes., After 30 minutes, fold the dough again, by grabbing the edges and stretching them up and into the center. Fold about 4 times. Then lightly coat the dough and the bottom of the tub with olive oil to help prevent sticking. Let it rest, covered at room temperature, for 5-6 hours, or until doubled. When the dough is about double its original volume, it’s ready to be divided., Divide. Moderately flour a work surface about 2 feet wide. With floured hands, gently ease the dough out of the tub. With your hands still floured, pick up the dough and ease it back down onto the work surface in a somewhat even shape. Dust the entire top of the dough with flour, then using a large knife or bench scraper, cut it into 6 equal-size pieces., Shape each piece of the dough into balls. You will end up with 6 balls. Gently fold it into a ball, then very carefully roll it along the counter to seal the bottom. Be careful not to knead it - you don't want to deflate the dough. Gently form the 6 balls., After each ball is formed, place it into a piece of plastic wrap that is sprayed with cooking spray or lightly oiled, to prevent from sticking.Seal each dough ball in the plastic wrap (be gentle with the dough as you do it). Place all 6 balls of wrapped dough onto a large baking sheet and place in the fridge., Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to make the dough easier to shape., Once the dough has refrigerated, you are now ready to prep it for the oven.To prep for the pizza put the pizza stone in the oven and heat to 550°F or the hottest your oven will go (heat it on the BAKE feature, not broil). (If it only goes to 500°F that's fine, you'll just bake it a little longer.), Red Sauce, Pulse all sauce ingredients quickly in a blender. It doesn't need to be too finely pureed., Forming the Pizza, Remove the dough ball from the refrigerator, put it on a floured work surface and gently pat it down a bit to coat the bottom with flour. Flip and coat the other side with flour as well., Gently stretch and turn the dough repeatedly, still letting the bottom of the dough pull down, expanding the surface. Keep a close eye on the thickness of the dough. You want it thin, but you don’t want it to tear or develop holes. If you end up with a small tear, don’t panic – it’s OK to patch it., Using your fingertips, press outward on the dough until it forms a 10-14 inch pizza. Leave the outside 1 inch of the dough's outer rim thicker to be your crust., Be sure to flour your pizza peel well, so the pizza dough doesn't stick. Add the dough onto the floured pizza peel and run your hands around the perimeter to shape it into a round and work out the kinks., Add pizza toppings starting with red sauce, then fresh mozzarella. Be sure to tear or cut your fresh mozzarella into thin pieces - it gets goopy if it's too thick. Sparsely place the fresh mozzarella around the rest of the dough - you want spaces of red sauce in between the cheese to get an even amount without too much cheese., Add any additional toppings you'd like - we love adding fresh basil leaves before baking - they get sweet and crispy when cooked. You can also add fresh basil after the pizza comes out. Oregano, fresh parmesan, pepperoni, and sausage are also great on these pizzas. Keep it simple though, so the delicious sauce and crust can still be tasted., Cooking the Pizza, Once your pizza is topped, slide dough off pizza peel into oven (onto pizza stone - leave stone in the oven). Bake for 5-6 minutes at 550 (if your oven only goes to 500, bake for 7-8 minutes), or until tops of crust and cheese are browning., Remove pizza with pizza peel and transfer to a cool surface (we use a large wooden cutting board or baking sheet).

Continue adding the flour until the dough can be pulled away from the sides of the bowl with a spatula, but the dough will still be quite sticky.

Hold the piece of dough in your hands and add a little more flour as needed so it won’t stick to your hands. Gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides, rotating the dough a quarter-turn as you go to form a ball.

Sprinkle the surface of one of the refrigerated dough balls with flour., Roll out and stretch a pizza crust: Flatten the dough with your hands and a rolling pin on the counter or directly onto the pizza peel to produce a 1/8-inch-thick round, dusting with flour to keep the dough from adhering to your work surface. Use a dough scraper to “un-stick” the dough as needed, and transfer it to the prepared pizza peel if you haven’t stretched the dough directly on one. When you’re finished, the dough round will be about 12 inches across, and should have enough flour under it to move easily when you shake the peel. As you add the toppings, continue to test for sticking by gently shaking the peel. The pizza should move freely. If it doesn’t, use the dough scraper and some flour to un-stick it., Add the toppings: Spread 1/4 cup of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border at the edges, then add 3 ounces of mozzarella and several basil leaves, and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. We prefer using well-spaced chunks of cheese, which gradually melt and spread (giving the crust a longer opportunity to crisp before toppings burn). Drizzle a little olive oil over the pizza., Slide the pizza onto the preheated stone: Place the tip of the peel near the back of the stone, close to where you want the far edge of the pizza to land. Give the peel a few quick forward-and-back jiggles and pull it sharply out from under the pizza. Check for doneness in 8 to 10 minutes and turn the pizza around in the oven if one side is browning too fast. It may take up to 5 more minutes in the oven.

It will be stiff, but be sure all the flour is incorporated. Cover the bowl and let stand at room temperature approximately 18-24 hours. Doing this the night before is best., Divide and rest the dough (Approximately 1 hour before you want to assemble your pizzas):, Using a silicone bowl scraper, scrape the dough onto a well floured surface. It will seem very loose and sticky at this point still. That's normal. Generously dust the top of the dough with some flour, then use the bowl scraper or a bench scraper to roll the dough around a bit in the flour on the work surface, to coat thinly. You will find it should quickly become workable and no longer sticky. Divide the dough into two equal pieces (or four, for mini pizzas). Shape each piece into a ball, then cover with a clean towel and let rest for 1 hour., Prepare your oven: Place your pizza stone into the cold oven on a rack in the lower third of the oven. I like to remove any top rack at this point, too, just to not have that obstacle when transferring the pizza into and out of the oven. Preheat oven to the highest setting, typically 500F. Let the oven preheat while your dough rests., Prepare your sauce: If you are making your own pizza sauce, prepare that when the dough is resting as well. Using a fine mesh strainer, drain the juice from the canned tomatoes, then gently squeeze the tomatoes to let some of the juice inside the tomatoes drain off as well. Place the tomatoes into a food processor, with the garlic, olive oil, spices and a generous pinch of salt. Pulse a few times, to break it up, but not so much that it is completely smooth. A few small pieces of tomato visible is about right. Set aside., Shape the pizza: Dust a sheet of parchment paper with flour or cornmeal. Take a ball of dough and gently stretch it out a bit. Place it on your prepared parchment and gently, using just your fingertips so you don't deflate the dough too much, press and stretch outward to shape the pizza and make it bigger. If it seems to not be enlarging much, lift it up by the outside edge and let it hang in the air. The weight of the dough will stretch it out. Rotate around the edge and let it stretch in the same way. Return the dough to the parchment and finish stretching and shaping. If you like a thin crust pizza, your dough will need to be quite thin. Leave the outside edges thicker, for the lovely bubbly edge crust., Add the toppings: Spread the pizza sauce on the dough. Place 2-3 slices of prosciutto onto the pizza. I like to twist it a bit so it doesn't lay flat on the sauce. This helps to get some lovely, crisp prosciutto as it bakes. Scatter some goat cheese on top, then some shredded mozzarella (not too much, just enough to fill in here and there)., Bake your pizza: Trim the parchment paper close to your pizza, so there is little excess that might scorch in the hot oven. Using a pizza peel, transfer your pizza on top of the parchment paper and onto the hot pizza stone. Allow to bake 7-8 minutes. If you like, you can very carefully pull the parchment paper out from under the pizza at this point. Allow the pizza to continue baking until the crust underneath has some good colour, the topping are bubbly and the top edges of the crust are quite dark in spots.

Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let it sit 10 minutes to dissolve. Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, whisk together the oat, sweet rice, millet, and brown rice flours with the cornstarch, tapioca flour, chia seed, and salt. When the yeast has dissolved, dump in the flour mixture and the olive oil, and stir vigorously until the dough is smooth and comes away from the sides of the bowl, adding a tablespoon or two more brown rice flour if the dough is too wet, or a tablespoon of two more water if it is too dry. Cover the bowl with a large plate or plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place until nearly doubled in size, about 45 minutes. (If you're not ready to bake yet, just press the air out of the dough and let it sit until you're ready.), Meanwhile, position a rack in the lower third of the oven, place a baking stone on the rack if you've got one, and preheat to 500ºF for at least 30 minutes to get the stone really hot., Shape the crusts:, Drizzle two sheets of parchment paper with half a tablespoon olive oil each. Divide the dough in half and form each half into rough balls. Place each ball in the center of the oiled parchment, drizzle the tops with another half tablespoon each of olive oil, and begin pressing one dough ball into a 10-11"" round using the pads of your fingers. Use a cupping motion with your hands to smooth the edges and form a slight lip around the edge of the dough. Repeat with the second round of dough., Rub the tops of the crusts with a little more oil and let rise until slightly puffed and spongy, 10-20 minutes., Par bake the dough:, Trim the edges of the parchment so that they are 1"" wider than the crust. Slide the first crust, parchment and all, onto the pizza peel and slip it, still on its parchment, onto the hot baking stone in the oven. Par bake the crust until the top is dry but still pale, 3 minutes. Use tongs to grasp the parchment and pull the whole thing back onto the pizza peel, then transfer to your work surface. Repeat the parbaking with the second crust., The crust is now ready to top and bake.

If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well. Lightly grease a large baking sheet or pizza pan with 1/2 Tablespoon of olive oil.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F. You most definitely need a pizza peel for this – or at least something to easily transfer your dough to your stone., In a large bowl, mix together the water, yeast and honey. Let that sit and get foamy, about 10ish minutes. During that time, I like to get out all of my pizza ingredients and measure them out – because this dough doesn’t have to rise! For the above pizza, I used pureed crushed tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, a little crushed garlic and fresh basil leaves. You want everything measured out and ready to top so you can quickly transfer the dough to the stone., After 10 minutes, stir the flour and salt into the yeast mixture. Stir until the dough comes together, first using a spoon and then using your hands. If the dough is REALLY sticky, use a little more flour until it becomes silky, adding 1 tablespoon of flour as needed. Flour your workspace and knead the dough a few times with your hands. Let it sit for 5 minutes., Roll the dough out as thin as you possible can – at least 10 inches. If the dough keeps springing back, let it rest another 5 or 10 minutes. Flour your pizza peel VERY well. To transfer the thin dough to your peel, I gently and quickly fold the dough in half and then in half again, pick it up, and unfold it on the floured peel. Quickly add your toppings – your sauce and cheese and what not. Remember, with this thin crust it is best to not do tons of heavy toppings. Work quickly so the dough do not stick to the peel., Open the oven and gently slice the pizza from the peel to the stone – I use a spatula to help if needed. Bake the pizza for 10 to 15 minutes – just keep and eye on it since the oven is so hot and stones can differ. It will be done when the crust is crispy and cheese is golden., Remove the pizza by sliding it back onto the pizza peel with the help of a spatula. Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing., Note: if you want to use a baking sheet, I’d preheat the oven to about 450 degrees F and cook it slightly longer.","[('water', 0.5, 'cup'), ('yeast', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('honey', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('flour', 1.5, 'cup'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('tomatoes', None, None), ('mozzarella', None, None), ('garlic', None, None), ('basil', None, None)]"

Let stand for 10 minutes or until yeast is bubbly. If you have a large mixer like a Bosch or a KitchenAid where the bowl slides up and down instead of the head tilting, this recipe will be too small for your mixer and you may want to consider doubling the dough, using half for croutons and the other half for pizza, breadsticks, or calzones., Add salt and stir.

Preheat oven to 450 F., Remove the dough from the bowl and place on a surface lightly sprayed with cooking spray (or dusted with flour). Roll the dough until it is as thin as possible without tearing. Whisk together the egg and a splash of water and brush over the dough (this will make your croutons very crunchy–if you’d rather them be a little softer, brush with olive oil). Sprinkle with Everything Bagel Seasoning and use a pizza cutter to cut the dough into strips. Carefully transfer the strips to the prepared baking sheets and place both sheets into the oven at the same time (if you’d like, you can rotate which one is on top and which is on bottom halfway through, but you don’t have to).

This should take 30 to 45 seconds in a mixer using the beater paddle; or about 1 minute by hand, using a spoon or spatula. Scrape down the sides of the bowl to gather the dough into a rough ball; cover the bowl.,   ,         , , After 5 minutes, uncover the bowl and reach a bowl scraper or your wet hand down between the side of the bowl and the dough, as though you were going to lift the dough out. Instead of lifting, stretch the bottom of the dough up and over its top. Repeat three more times, turning the bowl 90° each time. This process of four stretches, which takes the place of kneading, is called a fold. ,   ,         , , Re-cover the bowl, and after 5 minutes do another fold. Wait 5 minutes and repeat; then another 5 minutes, and do a fourth and final fold. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest, undisturbed, for 40 minutes. Then refrigerate it for a minimum of 12 hours, or up to 72 hours. It'll rise slowly as it chills, developing flavor; this long rise will also add flexibility to your schedule., , About 3 hours before you want to serve your pizza, prepare your pan. Pour 1 1/2 tablespoons (18g) olive oil into a well-seasoned cast iron skillet that’s 10” to 11” diameter across the top, and about 9” across the bottom. Heavy, dark cast iron will give you a superb crust; but if you don’t have it, use another oven-safe heavy-bottomed skillet of similar size, or a 10” round cake pan or 9” square pan. Tilt the pan to spread the oil across the bottom, and use your fingers or a paper towel to spread some oil up the edges, as well.  , , Transfer the dough to the pan and turn it once to coat both sides with the oil. After coating the dough in oil, press the dough to the edges of the pan, dimpling it using the tips of your fingers in the process. The dough may start to resist and shrink back; that’s OK, just cover it and let it rest for about 15 minutes, then repeat the dimpling/pressing. At this point the dough should reach the edges of the pan; if it doesn’t, give it one more 15-minute rest before dimpling/pressing a third and final time. ,   ,         , , Cover the crust and let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature. The fully risen dough will look soft and pillowy and will jiggle when you gently shake the pan., , About 30 minutes before baking, place one rack at the bottom of the oven and one toward the top (about 4"" to 5"" from the top heating element). Preheat the oven to 450°F., , When you’re ready to bake the pizza, sprinkle about three-quarters of the mozzarella (a scant 1 cup) evenly over the crust. Cover the entire crust, no bare dough showing; this will yield caramelized edges. Dollop small spoonfuls of the sauce over the cheese; laying the cheese down first like this will prevent the sauce from seeping into the crust and making it soggy. Sprinkle on the remaining mozzarella.,   ,         , , Bake the pizza on the bottom rack of the oven for 18 to 20 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and the bottom and edges of the crust are a rich golden brown (use a spatula to check the bottom). If the bottom is brown but the top still seems pale, transfer the pizza to the top rack and bake for 2 to 4 minutes longer. On the other hand, if the top seems fine but the bottom's not browned to your liking, leave the pizza on the bottom rack for another 2 to 4 minutes. Home ovens can vary a lot, so use the visual cues and your own preferences to gauge when you’ve achieved the perfect bake., , Remove the pizza from the oven and place the pan on a heatproof surface. Carefully run a table knife or spatula between the edge of the pizza and side of the pan to prevent the cheese from sticking as it cools. Let the pizza cool very briefly; as soon as you feel comfortable doing so, carefully transfer it from the pan to a cooling rack or cutting surface. This will prevent the crust from becoming soggy.,   ,         , , Serve the pizza anywhere from medium-hot to warm.

It’s really helpful when dimpling the dough!, This is the non-stick baking pan I use. You’ll get perfect, golden pizza crust every time. If using a different pan, especially if it’s not non-stick, line the bottom with parchment paper to fit the inside dimensions of the pan (no overhang). Dark pans are best for heat conduction and crust color., I bake my sourdough pizza @ 450 F. I know my oven. However, if you prefer to bake at a lower temperature, approximately 425 F, you can. Increase the bake times to 18-20 minutes, for both the par-bake and actual pizza bake., Please use quality whole-milk mozzarella cheese (block cheese, not bagged shredded). Bagged shredded cheese contains too many anti-caking agents which will wreck your pizza. The cheese will taste dry and plasticky. Cube any small chunks that are too small to grate, and stick in the corners of the pan for extra crispy edges., Use room temperature ingredients. No cold sauce! This will ensure a crisp, pizza crust crust. It will also keep the oven temperature hot and stable, not steamy.","Make the Dough, In the evening, combine the sourdough starter and water in a large mixing bowl (I use a fork to mix). Add the flour and salt., Continue mixing, and then finish by hand to fully incorporate the flour. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and let rest for 30 minutes at room temperature., After resting, return to the bowl and fold the dough over itself several times, similar to the stretch and fold method, to create a rough ball. The dough is now ready to rise., Bulk Rise, Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled high-sided 2 qt. dough tub., Cover and let rise overnight at room temperature, about 68 F for 10-12+ hrs. The dough is ready when it has almost doubled in size. If your ambient temperature is warmer /colder than 68 F, the dough will take shorter/longer to rise, respectively. Watch the dough and not the clock. Rise times will be different for every baker. (see Note #1)., Dimple the Dough {2 Times}, Coat a non-stick 9×13-inch baking pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Use your hands to rub the bottom and sides of the pan., Remove the dough directly into the pan. With oiled fingertips, gently dimple and stretch the dough to reach the corners and sides of the pan- that’s the end goal. If the dough is relaxed, it will naturally spread out. If it’s tight, which is normal after a long rise, the dough will resist. Simply take note of your dough at this stage. Don’t force it. Watch my video for visual instructions., Cover the pan with an inverted baking sheet and rest in a warm spot, such as a proofing box set to 78F or a turned off oven with the light on, for 30 minutes., After 30 minutes has elapsed: return to the pan and dimple the dough again, just like you did before, gently lifting and stretching it as you go. Cover and rest for another 30 minutes. Preheat your oven to 450 F now., After the second 30 minutes has elapsed, you’re ready to par-bake the pizza crust., ParBake Pizza Crust, Place the baking pan on the bottom rack. Bake the dough @ 450 F for 15-18 minutes, or until the surface is set and the bottom crust is light golden brown. Use tongs to peek underneath the dough to double check. The bottom crust color depends on the type of pan you’re using; adjust the time or oven rack as needed., Remove the pan from the oven. You are now ready to assemble and bake pizza (see Note #2)., Assemble & Bake Pizza, To Make Sourdough Pizza (now), Top the par-baked pizza crust with tomato sauce. I spread it all over the surface including the crust. Season with salt and pepper. Add the basil leaves, a fresh grating of Parmesan cheese and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese taking it to the corners and sides for crispy edges. Tuck any remaining cheese cubes into the corners. Bake @ 450 F, middle or top rack this time, until the cheese is melted and broiled in some spots, about 12-15 minutes. You can even stick it under the broiler to really crisp it up., To Make Sourdough Pizza (later): Transfer the par-baked pizza crust to a wire rack to cool. You want to aerate the underside so the crust doesn’t get soggy. Once completely cool, cover tightly in plastic wrap and store at room temperature for up to 6 hours.

Add the water followed by the oil, and use a spatula to combine. Stir vigorously and thoroughly — the mixture will feel more like a wet (but smooth) batter. As the dough rises, it will thicken., Cover the bowl with a bowl cover or lid and place in a warm spot to rise for 2 to 3 hours or until roughly doubled in volume., Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured (using rice flour or other gluten-free flour) work surface. Divide into two equal portions (roughly 271 grams each if you care to measure). Gently ball up each portion using rice flour (or other gluten-free flour) as needed — it will be sticky. At this point, you can transfer the portions to a container topped with an airtight lid and place in the fridge for up to 1 week. Otherwise, proceed with the recipe., Make the Pizza, Place a Baking Steel or pizza stone in the top third of your oven and preheat your oven to its hottest setting — for me, this is 550ºF convection roast. If time permits, allow the Steel to preheat for 1 hour., On a lightly floured work surface (using rice flour or other gluten-free flour), gently roll out the dough into roughly an 11- or 12-inch round — as you approach 12 inches, the dough will begin to get fragile so handle it delicately. (Note: Do not worry about holes or tears, all of which can be easily patched once the dough is on the parchment paper and peel.), Place a sheet of parchment paper onto a pizza peel. Pour 1 teaspoon of olive oil into the center and rub with your hand to spread. Gently transfer the dough to the prepared peel and, if the dough is not yet 12 inches in diameter, spread it with your hands until it gets there. (Note: If the dough tears during the transfer, just push on and press the dough back together.) Pinch the outer edge of the dough firmly with your fingers so that it’s very thin., Shimmy the dough, parchment paper and all, onto the preheated Steel and cook for 2 minutes. Remove the dough, parchment paper and all, and transfer to a cutting board or other work surface., Spread the tomato sauce over the dough all the way to the edges. Scatter the cheese evenly over the top. Drizzle lightly with olive oil. Season with a pinch of salt. Shimmy the topped parbaked round, parchment paper and all, onto the Steel and cook for 4 – 5 minutes or until the pizza is cooked to your liking., Transfer the pizza to a cutting board.

Set the pan in the oven and set the oven temperature to 450 F. Let the pan set in the hot oven for at least 10 minutes after the oven is heated to get good and hot., When the dough is ready, on a floured surface, roll out one of the crusts into a 9-10 inch circle., Set one pizza crust in the hot pan and prick with a fork a few times.

Measure out the cold water and add the olive oil. While the processor is running, slowly pour the water and oil down the feed tube and process until the dough comes together. It will form a shaggy ball and clear the sides of the food processor bowl., Spray your countertop lightly with cooking spray and transfer dough to the counter. Knead a few times and shape the dough into a ball. Spray a bowl with cooking spray, place the dough in the bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Leave the dough on the counter to rise until it has doubled in size. That should take about 2 to 2 ½ hours., About 45 minutes before the dough is ready, place your pizza stone in the oven on the bottom rack and heat the oven to 475°. If you happen to have a double oven and two pizza stones, great…if not you’ll have to cook one pizza at a time., While the dough is rising and oven is heating up prepare your pizza sauce and toppings. (See my Easy No Cook Pizza Sauce recipe), When the dough is ready, transfer to a lightly floured counter. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and sprinkle each with flour. Using your fingertips, form each half into a small round disk, about 7-8 inches. Then using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into about 12 inch circles, using additional flour as needed., Sprinkle your pizza peel with corn meal. If you don’t have a pizza peel, sprinkle a sheet of parchment paper with cornmeal. Transfer the dough to the peel ensuring that the dough will slide on the cornmeal…if not, add a little more cornmeal. If using parchment you can leave the pizza on the parchment paper though out the cooking process. Add about ½ cup pizza sauce, your desired toppings, and about 6 ounces (1 ½ cups) of mozzarella cheese (preferably, freshly grated…it melts better)., When it’s topped the way you like it, make sure the pizza will still slide on your peel/pan. If not lift up the edge of the pizza and toss some more corn meal under the dough. Next, slide your pizza onto the hot pizza stone. Depending on the type of stone you have it may be easier to get the stone out of the oven and set it on the stove top rather than trying to slide the pizza into the oven. If using parchment, add the pizza on the parchment directly on top of the pizza stone. The parchment method is a little easier and less messy...but, whatever works best for you., The pizza will need to cook 12-15 minutes, depending on how dark you like your pizza. We like ours well browned on the top and the edges dark and crispy….just like at Vito and Nick’s.

With the dough hook attached, knead on low speed until the ingredients come together in a ball. Stop the mixer and cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel, letting the dough rest for 15 minutes. Remove the towel and knead the dough on medium low speed (Kitchenaid speed 2) for 8-10 minutes or until the dough is soft and smooth. Alternatively, knead by hand on a clean work surface., Lightly coat a large bowl or container with olive oil. Lightly coat your hands in oil to remove the dough from the mixing bowl (this prevents the dough from sticking to your hands) and shape into a ball with your hands. Place in the bowl, turning the dough over to coat with oil on all sides. Cover with a lid or plastic wrap and place in the fridge overnight, at least 12-24 hours., Remove the dough from the fridge about an hour before you plan to make pizza. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. You can eyeball it or weigh the total dough, dividing by eight to get the weight of each ball of dough. I typically portion off pieces that weigh 180-200 grams. On a heavily floured work surface, dip both sides of the dough into the flour then gently stretch each into an 8-10 inch circle. If the dough resists stretching, cover it with a clean dry towel and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before stretching. Generously sprinkle a pizza peel with rice flour and place dough on top.

Turn the vessel quarter turns and continue this pulling 8 to 10 times. Let the dough rest for another 30 minutes; then repeat the stretching and folding. After these two sets of stretches and folds, you should see a difference in the texture of the dough: it will be smoother, stronger, and more elastic., If you have a straight-sided vessel, transfer the dough to it; then cover it with a tea towel or bowl cover and set aside to rise at room temperature (70ºF/21ºC) for 4 to 8 hours (the time will vary depending on the time of year, the strength of your starter, and the temperature of your kitchen) or until the dough has roughly doubled in volume. (A straight-sided vessel makes monitoring the bulk fermentation especially easy because it allows you to see when your dough has truly doubled.), Turn the dough out onto a work surface and shape into a rough ball. I like to do this without flour, but use flour as needed — the dough will be sticky. Use the pinkie-edges of your hands to pinch the dough underneath to create a ball. Skip to preparing the pan., Grease a 10×14-inch pan with the tablespoon of softened butter. Pour 1 teaspoon of olive oil into the center. Place the dough ball in the pan and turn to coat. Let rest for 3 to 4 hours. With lightly oiled hands, stretch the dough to fit the pan. Let the dough rest again for 1 hour., Parbake the dough:, Preheat the oven to 500ºF., Dimple the dough one last time with lightly oiled hands taking care not to dimple the perimeter. Transfer the pan to the oven for 8 minutes., Remove the pan from the oven and carefully transfer the dough to a cooling rack. Let it cool upside down on the rack for 20 minutes. Do not wash the pan., Once the dough is cooled, you can transfer it to an airtight storage bag for 1 to 2 days at room temperature or up to 3 months in the freezer., Preheat the oven to 475ºF. If you do have a Baking Steel or pizza stone, place it on a rack in the middle or lower third of the oven while it preheats., Return the parbaked crust to its pan (bottom side down)., Combine the two pre-shredded cheeses for the frico crust in a medium bowl. Spread this cheese around the perimeter of the dough pressing it into the sides of the pan., Sprinkle the hand-grated mozzarella over the interior surface of the dough., Finish topping the pizza: spread the 1/2 cup of tomato sauce evenly over the top. Spread the pepperoni evenly over the surface. If you are using pickled jalapeños, scatter them evenly over the pizza, keeping in mind heat tolerance — they make the pizza very spicy., Transfer pizza to the oven for 10 minutes or until the edges are caramelized to your liking. Remove the pan from the oven and let the pizza rest for 5 minutes in the pan. Carefully run a paring knife or spatula around the pan’s edges. Then, carefully remove the entire pizza from the pan, transferring it to a cutting board. If you are using the honey, drizzle it over top.

If your mixing bowl is cold, first warm it up a bit by swirling some hot water in it. Discard the hot water and then pour luke warm water. An ideal temperature of warm water is 40 to 43 C or 105 to 110 F., Dip your finger and ensure the water is warm and not hot. Then add yeast and sugar. Stir and set aside undisturbed for 10 to 12 minutes., After 15 mins the yeast mixture should become bubbly or frothy indicating it is active and alive. If it doesn’t turn frothy by then, the yeast is inactive and cannot be used for the dough. In this case discard and start afresh with luke warm water, sugar and yeast., When the water turns frothy, add flour, salt and oil. Next mix and make a soft dough adding more water if needed., Knead the dough very well until soft & elastic for about 5 to 6 mins., To check if it is done, poke it with your finger. It should dent easily and bounce back slowly. This is an indication of the dough being ready., Apply a thin layer of oil to the bowl and the dough as well. Keep covered with a moist cloth or a lid., Proofing pizza dough, Let it rise at room temperature until it doubles or triples. An ideal temperature for rising dough is 26C (80 F) to 32C (90 F). Depending on the temperature it will take any where from 1 to 4 hours to rise., High temperatures will kill the yeast so be cautious. Let it rise slowly for longer so it develops a good flavor. During winters, you may proof it in your instant pot on the yogurt settings (LOW)., Prepare pizza sauce, Puree or chop tomatoes finely. To make sauce, heat oil in a pan and saute garlic until it smells good. Then add red chili flakes & mix., Add tomatoes, salt and sugar. Stir and continue to cook covering partially as it splatters a lot., Cook until the sauce thickens and is of spreading consistency (but not runny). Add herbs and crushed pepper., Mix and taste the sauce. You may add more salt, herbs and pepper to suit your taste buds. Set this aside to cool., Prepare veggies, Bring your choice of veggies to room temperature. Avoid using cold veggies from the refrigerator as they let out moisture on the pizza making it soggy., Rinse and slice or cube the veggies. Separate the layers of onions. Avoid chopping them too small or too large., If using bottled olives drain them to a small strainer. Grate or cube the cheese and set aside., How to make pizza (thin crust), When the dough rises well, punch it a few times to deflate and remove air bubbles., Transfer the dough to the work area. Divide to 2 to 3 portions depending on the size you prefer., Knead it a bit and gently shape it to round balls. If the dough is too sticky then sprinkle some flour & knead. After this step you may make the pizza or cover the bowl with a cling wrap and refrigerate it for up to 3 days., When you are ready to make the pizza, preheat the oven to the highest temperature, 220 to 240 C or 470F for at least 25 to 30 mins. Place a baking tray or a cast iron pan in the middle rack and heat it as well in the oven., Sprinkle some cornmeal over the pizza tray. Place the pizza dough over the tray and flatten it slightly., Add few drops of oil on the dough. Begin to spread and stretch the dough on the tray with your fingers. Flatten to a 9 inch thin even base. Keep the edges slightly thicker than the center. (with this recipe you can make three 9 inch thin crust pizzas or one 14 inch thin crust.), Spread the pizza sauce as desired, leaving about ¼ inch on the edges. Layer the grated cheese and then the veggies. Lastly sprinkle Italian herbs and red chili flakes. To finish off top with more cheese if desired avoiding over the veggies., Place the pizza tray right over the hot baking tray or cast iron pan in your oven. Bake for 10 to 12 mins or until the pizza base becomes crisp, golden and cheese turns slightly golden., If your cheese doesn’t turn golden, you can move it to the top rack and bake for another 1 to 2 mins. Slice and serve pizza hot or warm., To make thick crust, To make a thick crust pizza, spread the dough to a slightly thicker base (⅛ inch) with your hands so the sides are thicker than the middle., Prick the base with a fork 8 to 9 times randomly so the base doesn't puff like bread., If making a thick base & you own a small oven, then put the base in the oven without the sauce and toppings.

You can also oil pans if you don't have cornmeal., Grease a clean work surface and your hands with olive oil. Transfer dough to oiled surface and cut into three even pieces. Form each piece into an 8"" round pizza crust using your hands and transfer to baking pans lined with cornmeal., Spread 1/3 pizza sauce on each pizza leaving a 1/2"" border of dough all the way around. Add plenty of mozzarella cheese and any of your favorite toppings; this is where it gets really fun! (See list of toppings above for supreme pizza or Greek Pizza)., Bake pizzas at 415 degrees F for 15 minutes or until the crust is crisp and toppings are cooked. Cheese will be melted and turn golden in a few spots., (Tip for the Greek Pizza: once the toppings are on, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. After the pizza comes out of the oven, sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese. It's so good!)","[('warm water', 0.75, 'cup'), ('active dry yeast', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('honey', 0.5, 'tbsp'), ('olive oil', 1.5, 'tbsp'), ('olive oil', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('all-purpose flour', 2.0, 'cups'), ('salt', 0.75, 'tsp'), ('cornmeal', 0.25, 'cup'), ('marinara', 1.5, 'cup'), ('garlic clove', 1.0, None), ('oregano', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('mozzarella cheese', 1.0, None), ('artichokes', 1.5, None), ('olives', 1.0, None), ('tomatoes', 1.0, None), ('red onion', 1.0, None), ('evoo', 1.0, None), ('feta', 1.0, None), ('mozzarella cheese', 1.0, None), ('ham', 1.0, None), ('black olives', 1.0, None), ('mushrooms', 1.0, None), ('red onion', 1.0, None), ('tomato', 1.0, None), ('bell pepper', 1.0, None), ('parmesan cheese', 1.0, None)]"

Allow mixture to stand for 5 minutes. Add one cup of flour, and mix to combine. Add another cup of flour and mix through. Mix by hand for 1 or 2 minutes. The dough should be the consistency of cake batter. Add another cup of flour and mix through. Add flour until you can’t mix it by hand very well. Sprinkle some flour on your table and turn the dough onto the table. Knead the dough by hand until it is smooth and elastic, adding flour as needed. This should take 6 to 10 minutes of kneading. Place the dough back in the bowl, cover it with a towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 15 to 60 minutes (this time varies a lot for me — I just let it rise according to how long it is until dinner time)., While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 500 degrees F. If you have a baking stone, put it in the oven to heat up, too. I would recommend using a stone for baking this pizza. If you don’t have a stone, you can turn your biggest cookie sheet upside down (so that the flat side is up), or use a rimless sheet. If you are using a stone let the stone heat for 30 minutes. If using a baking sheet, let it heat for 15 minutes., When the oven is hot, cut your dough in half. Place half of the dough on a piece of parchment paper that is 18 inches long. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough (on top of the parchment paper) into a large circle. The dough should be between 1/4- and 1/2-inch thick (I like mine thin, Husband likes his thicker… you’ll have to find what you like). Top with 1 cup of pizza sauce, 1 1/2 cups of shredded mozzarella, and half of the crumbled bacon, tomatoes, and herbs., When the pizza is all ready, slide the pizza, which is on the parchment paper, onto a rimless cookie sheet or one that is upside down. This will help you get the pizza to the oven., Open the oven and slide the pizza, which is still on the parchment paper, from the cookie sheet onto the hot baking stone or hot cookie sheet. I just tug on the edge of the parchment paper with my hands and slide it on to the stone. BE CAREFUL! Your oven is set to 500 degrees F. It’s super hot, obviously! Make sure the babies are out of the way, and be careful when sliding the pizza into the oven., Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the top is bubbly and the edges are starting to brown. When the pizza is done, tug the edge of the parchment paper, and slide the pizza back onto the cookie sheet you used to transfer it to the oven. Again, be careful!, Let your stone reheat for 10 minutes. While the stone is heating, repeat the whole thing with the second half of the dough and bake the same way., Repeat with the second half of the dough and the rest of the toppings., Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!, I serve it right off of the parchment paper (which gets all dark and cooked looking) or I’ll tear off a new piece and serve it on a crisp white sheet of parchment.

If there are spots that are much thicker than others, press them out with your palm., If you are using a pizza peel and are going to transfer your pizza to a pizza oven or pizza stone, give the peel a shake to make sure that the dough isn't sticking to the peel and so it will easily slide off., Sauce, In a deep skillet or sauce pot, add the olive oil and garlic cook over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic is soft and fragrant., Add the rest of the ingredients and stir to combine everything.

Add the flour, salt, yeast, water, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Use a silicone spatula or wooden spoon to stir it all together. Once it’s come together into a rough mass, use your hands to continue forming it. Scoop up and gather any dry bits of flour or loose pieces and press them into the mass., Form the mass into a ball and place it into the ball. Cover it with the lid or a kitchen towel and walk away for 5 minutes. Grab a small bowl and add some lukewarm water to it, place it beside the bowl of dough., After 5 minutes, dip your hand into the bowl of water, let the excess drip off, and then reach into the bowl underneath the dough. Tuck your fingers beneath it as if you were about to lift it out but instead grab the bottom, pinch it a bit, and stretch the bottom of the dough over the top of itself and push it down into the top. Turn the bowl 90º and repeat. Repeat three times, for four stretches., Cover the bowl back up for another 5 minutes, then repeat. You’re gonna do this 5 times, then drizzle in a bit of olive oil. Turn the dough ball to coat in the oil, then transfer to an air-tight container or cover it tightly in the bowl with beeswax or plastic wrap if it doesn’t have a lid. Stick in the fridge and let it rest there for at least 12 hours, up to 72 hours., During the period while the dough is resting make the pizza seasoning, and combine the pizza sauce and Calabrian pepper paste together. Set these aside for when you’re ready to make the pizza., About 3 hours before you want to serve your pizza, pull the dough from the fridge and prepare the pan. Pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil into your 10″ cast-iron skillet. Use a basting brush or paper towel to spread the oil evenly over the entire surface and up the sides of the pan., Transfer the dough ball to the pan. Use your fingertips (or you can try using your knuckles as I did) to “poke” the dough, pressing it outward toward the edges of the pan as you go. At first, the dough might shrink back or resist the spreading, but that’s normal. After you’ve spread it out a little bit, cover it with a paper towel and let it rest for 5-10 minutes. After the time has passed, uncover and poke it out toward the edges some more. If it still doesn’t reach the rim, cover and let it rest again before poking it one more time., Now, cover the crust back up with the paper towel and set it aside to rise undisturbed for two hours. It will be noticeably puffy the next time you see it., When you’re ready to make the pizza, arrange your oven racks with one at the top and one at the bottom and preheat the oven to 450°F., Sprinkle about a cup of mozzarella over the entire crust, all the way to the edges; I mean it! TO THE EDGES!! You don’t want to see any bare crust., Next, dollop about a tablespoon of pizza sauce evenly atop the cheese. Refer to the video if you need visuals. Next, sprinkle on about a teaspoon of pizza seasoning, then sprinkle on the remaining mozzarella., Place the pizza on the bottom rack for 18 minutes – the cheese should be bubbling and at least starting to brown. While the pizza is baking arrange the pepperoni on a paper towel-lined plate and microwave it for 10-15 seconds on high. This will par-cook the pepperoni and release some of the greases. Pull the pizza from the oven around that 20-minute mark, and arrange the pepperoni evenly on the top of the pizza all the way to the crispy edges. Sprinkle the parmesan over the top and return to the oven, this time on the top rack for 3 to 5 minutes longer., Remove the pizza from the oven and run a butter knife between the edge of the pizza and the pan to prevent the crispy cheese crust from adhering itself to the pan. As soon as you can do it without burning yourself use a pair of heavy-duty spatulas to lift the pizza from the cast iron pan and transfer it to a cutting board., Sprinkle on a bit more pizza seasoning to finish it off. Use kitchen shears or a very sharp pizza cutter to cut this pizza into slices without disturbing the toppings or crust too much. Dassit!

Add the warm water and olive oil, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together. It will seem shaggy and dry, don’t worry., Scrape the dough onto a well-floured counter top and knead the dough for three minutes. It should come together quickly. Dust the dough with flour as needed (sometimes I will have to do this 2 to 3 times, depending on humidity levels) – it should be slightly tacky, but should not be sticking to your counter top. After three minutes, the dough should be smooth, elastic, and tacky. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil, and place the dough into the bowl., Cover the bowl tightly with a plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise in a warm, dry area of your kitchen for 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size. If your kitchen is very cold, one great tip that I do all the time is to heat a large heatproof measuring cup of water in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. This creates a nice warm environment and I’ll immediately remove the cup and place the bowl with the dough in the microwave until it has risen., Preheat Oven and Pizza Stone: Place the pizza steel (or stone) in top third of your oven and preheat to 550°F (290°C) for one hour. If your oven does not go that high, heat it to the maximum temperature., As the oven is preheating, assemble the toppings. In a small bowl, stir together the pureed tomatoes, parmigiano, grated garlic, red pepper flakes, olive oil, and salt. Season to taste, adding more salt or pepper flakes if desired., Separate the dough into two equal-sized portions. It will deflate slightly, but that's ok. Place the dough on a large plate or floured counter top, cover gently with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes., Assemble the Pizza: Sprinkle the pizza peel with semolina flour. Gently stretch one ball of pizza dough into roughly a 11 to 12-inch circle (don’t worry if its not perfectly uniform). If the dough springs back or is too elastic, allow it to rest for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. The edges of the dough can be slightly thicker, but make sure the center of the dough is thin (you should be able to see some light through it if you held it up). Gently transfer the dough onto the semolina dusted peel., Using a large spoon, add roughly ⅓-½ cup of the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, leaving a ½-inch or ¾-inch border on all sides. Use the back of the spoon to spread it evenly and thinly. Distribute half of the roasted red peppers and kalamata olives on top of pizza, and top with half of the goat cheese, distributing it in small clumps across the surface of the pizza. Distribute half of the garlic shavings across the sauce., Gently slide the pizza from the peel onto the heated baking steel. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the cheese has caramelized slightly and the edges of the pizza are golden brown. Finish brielfy under the broiler for more color if desired.

Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes. *If you don’t have a stand mixer, simply use a large mixing bowl and mix the dough with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in the next step., Add the olive oil, salt, and flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes., Knead the dough:, Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if using the paddle) and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., Rise, Rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray—just use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size. If using instant yeast, this takes about 1 hour. (Tip: For the warm environment on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150°F (66°C). Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When it’s doubled in size, remove from the oven.), Preheat oven to 400°F (204°). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats., Shape the dough, When the dough is ready, punch it down to release the air. Divide in half. (If you aren’t making 2 strombolis, freeze the other half of dough. See freezing instructions below.) On a lightly floured work surface using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll each half of dough into a 10×16-inch rectangle. I like to use my hands to square off the edges, as shown in the video below. If the dough keeps shrinking as you try to shape it, cover it lightly and let the dough rest for 10 minutes before trying again. (The gluten just needs to settle.), ion-step-7"">Add fillings, Add fillings, Mix melted butter and garlic together. Spread all over each rectangle. Sprinkle each with parsley. When you start layering on meats and cheeses, leave a 1 inch border on the bottom and sides and a 3 inch border on top. (Basically you’ll have an empty 3×16-inch gap on top that only has butter/garlic on it. This is because when rolling, the fillings will be pushed forward. See photos and video below if you need a visual.) Arrange a layer sliced meats onto each dough, usually about 8-10 slices on each depending on size and thickness of slices. Add a layer of cheese. Repeat with more meat and cheese until all is used—about 1/2 pound meat and 1/2 pound cheese per stromboli. Brush all edges with egg wash, including 3 inch gap at the top. This helps the stromboli hold its rolled shape. Slowly roll each into a tight 16 inch log, folding in the two ends as you roll. See me do this in the video below. Dust your hands or the dough with flour if things become too sticky. Carefully transfer each to lined baking sheets.

Turn the temperature to the highest setting your oven will go (that’s 250C fan for me). When the oven has been heating for at least 45 minutes, top your pizzas. Place your bases on two pieces of baking paper so they’re easier to transfer into the oven. There’s nothing more disappointing than your pizza falling apart when you try to move them (trust me, I have done it!) Divide the pizza sauce between your bases, then scatter over half the mozzarella on each. Dollop the ‘nduja on top, followed by the torn ham and finally, the controversial pineapple pieces., Cook the pizzas, Transfer each pizza, on the baking paper, onto the preheated pizza stone/cast iron pan/oven trays and cook for 10 – 15 minutes (check it after 10 – this will depend on the heat of your oven) on the highest rack in your oven. You want the pizza crust to be looking puffy, golden and blistered, the cheese to be bubbling and oozy and the pineapple to be looking lovely and charred. Remove from the oven and drizzle over the sweet chilli jam if you’re using it. Finish with the rocket, then slice and serve straight away., If you're making the dough -, Mix the dough, Add the 500g flour, 1 teaspoon instant yeast, 2 teaspoons salt and 375g water into a large bowl. Mix with a spoon to form a rough, floury dough. Cover with a clean tea towel for 5 minutes. You’re now going to give the dough some ‘stretch and folds’ to help develop strength, without kneading. Start by wetting your hands, then with one hand in a ‘C’ shape, scoop your hand down the edge of your bowl, to reach underneath the dough. Pull the dough up with your hand, then fold it down back onto itself. Give the bowl a quarter turn, and repeat this process. Cover the bowl with cling film and let it rest for 10 minutes. After this time, repeat the stretch and fold process one more time, then cover the bowl again with cling film and leave to rise until doubled in size., Shape the bases, At least 30 minutes before you want to cook your pizzas, turn your oven to its highest setting (that’s 250C for me) and pop in whatever you’re going to cook the pizzas on – a pizza stone, cast iron pan or an oven tray. Divide the risen dough in 2. Using as much flour as you need, shape each piece into a ball. The easiest way to do this is to gently pull up one side of the dough a little, then fold it back on itself. Repeat with the other 3 sides, then flip the dough over. With floured hands, cup your hands around the dough and rotate the dough in a circle so that it forms into a ball, gently pulling the dough against the surface of the bench to create a little resistance so that it tightens up., Stretch the bases, . Prepare 2 pieces of baking paper large enough to fit your pizzas on. To make sure you get a super puffy and bubbly crust, you want to handle the dough gently when you’re shaping it into a circle. DON’T use a rolling pin – if you do, you’re just deflating all the lovely airiness you’ve worked so hard to create. Add a couple of tablespoons of flour to your surface, then gently press the middle of the ball out into a small circle, leaving about 1.5cm for the crust (don’t touch it!) At this point, with floured hands, pick up the dough and let it hang off your hands. You’re using gravity to help the dough naturally stretch. Carefully rotate the dough through your hands. As you do, the dough will stretch further.","[('tomato pizza sauce', 0.5, 'cup'), ('passata', 0.5, 'cup'), ('crushed tinned tomatoes', 0.5, 'cup'), ('garlic clove', 1.0, None), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('grated mozzarella', 1.0, 'cup'), ('chopped pineapple', 0.5, 'cup'), ('ham', 4.0, 'large pieces'), ('‘nduja paste', 4.0, 'tablespoons'), ('chilli jam', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('sweet chilli sauce', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('rocket leaves', 1.0, 'handful'), ('flour', 500.0, 'grams'), ('instant yeast', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('lukewarm water', 375.0, 'grams')]"

Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes., Add the remaining water, olive oil, salt, and 1 cup (130g) flour. Beat on low speed for 20 seconds, then add 3 and 1/2 cups (440g) more flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. If the dough is still sticking to the sides of the bowl, add the last 1/2 cup (60g) of flour., Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., Let the dough rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with a teaspoon of oil or some nonstick spray—just use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 2–3 hours or until double in size. (Tip: For the warm environment on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150°F (66°C). Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When it’s doubled in size, remove from the oven.), Prepare the pan, Generously grease a 12×17-inch baking pan (with at least 1-inch-tall sides) with 2 Tablespoons of olive oil. This is the base layer of the bread, so be generous with the oil. A pastry brush is helpful to spread it., Flatten the dough, When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Place on the oiled baking pan, then stretch and flatten the dough to fit the pan. Don’t tear the dough. If it’s shrinking (mine always does), cover it with a clean towel and let it rest for 5–10 minutes before continuing. This lets the gluten settle and it’s much easier to shape after that., Let the dough rest, Cover the dough tightly and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. The longer it rests, the better the flavor. I recommend at least 12 hours., Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature as you preheat the oven and prepare the toppings. Keep it covered. It may rise a little during this time, but not much., Preheat oven to 450°F (232°C). Allow it to heat for at least 10–15 minutes so every inch of the oven is very hot., Prepare the toppings:, Whisk the 3 remaining Tablespoons of olive oil with the minced garlic and herbs. Set aside., Using your fingers, dimple the dough all over the surface. You can watch me do this in the video above. Drizzle on the olive oil topping and use your hands or a pastry brush to spread it all over the top. Add a little more olive oil if needed so the dough is completely covered. (This creates the crisp crust!) Sprinkle with a little coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper., Bake for 20–23 minutes or until lightly browned on top. If desired, broil on high for the last minute to really brown the top., Cut and serve hot or let it come to room temperature before slicing and serving. Focaccia tastes wonderful warm or at room temperature. Cover leftover focaccia tightly and store at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for 1 week. You can also freeze the baked and cooled focaccia for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature.

Sprinkle flour over the dough and cover with a dry tea towel to let rise for 1 hour or until it has grown to about 30% larger and is puffy and smooth., Uncover dough and, with wet hands, pull one side of the dough out from the centre and stretch and fold it back over the remaining dough, gently pressing the edges downward to seal the edge. Turn bowl 90 degrees and repeat, stretching then folding the dough three more times so the seam faces upward. Place ball seam side down, dust with flour then cover again and let sit for 1 hour., Remove cover once again and perform 4 coil folds (*see note below), lifting and stretching the dough from the centre, turning clockwise 90 degrees after each fold until 4 to 6 folds have been completed. Tuck edges underneath and brush entire surface of dough with olive oil. Cover bowl tightly and let stand to rise overnight., Once the dough has doubled or tripled in size by morning, it’s ready to be divided. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and dust with flour. Using a dough scraper, divide it into equally sized portions (two or three pieces depending on how many pizzas you’re making)., Sprinkle a little flour on your hands then pre-shape your pizza dough using the cinch method (*see note below). Working gently and taking care not to degas the dough, slowly fold each section over into itself while turning it in your hands, pinching the dough towards the bottom as you go to create a ball with no seam left. Repeat with remaining sections, placing them into a lightly floured, high-walled baking dish as you go. (I like to use an airtight glass covered baking dish at this stage, but a baking sheet and plastic wrap will also work.) Lightly flour the tops, cover and let proof for 5-6 hours until you’re ready to stretch out your dough. At this point the dough balls will have relaxed a little and be soft and puffy to the touch., Once you’re ready to bake your pizza, transfer dough, still in proofing container, to refrigerator and chill for at least 30 minutes. This cold proof will help further strengthen the dough to make it easier to shape. While the dough is chilling, preheat oven to 500ºF (260ºC) and prepare your toppings., Scrape the first dough ball out onto a generously floured surface. Using floured hands and working from the inside out, press and stretch the dough outwards to shape your crust being careful to leave a 1-inch margin at the edges with any air bubbles left untouched. Once shaped, gently lift and transfer the dough onto parchment paper. Assemble pizza(s) withtomato sauceand your desired toppings then transfer to pizza stone or baking steel and bake for 6-7 minutes (for smaller pizzas) or 8-9 minutes (for a larger pizza) until golden with slightly charred edges.

It's usually ready earlier in the summer than winter. I always do equal parts so I'll typically have 50g of starter in my jar and feed it 50g of all-purpose flour & 50g of filtered water. I usually feed mine the night before and then start the process in the morning., Mix Bread:, In a large mixing bowl, add sourdough starter, 330g of water, and flour. Mix well until you get a shaggy ball. I'll usually start mixing with my dough hook and then finishing mixing with my hands. Cover with a shower cap, plastic wrap, or a damp dish towel for 1 hour., Add in the sea salt and remaining 10g of water. Mix it in with your hands to get it nice and incorporated.

Cover and let it rest for an hour., After the hour is up, you're going to perform 3 sets of stretch of folds over about a 3 hour period. To start, perform the 1st set of stretch and folds. Take one side of the dough and pull it up and fold it over itself. Turn the bowl and do that on all 4 sides of the dough. Then cover and let it rest. You're going to do that again after another 30 min-1 hour. Whatever works best for your schedule. After the second one, wait another 30 min- 1 hour and then do the last (3rd) set of stretch and folds. This helps build tension in the dough and will give it a better rise.

Then take your dough and roll it over itself so it's a cylinder., Then you're going to push the dough away from you and pull it back, which creates tension in the dough. This will gently form the dough into a ball. Do this about 15-20 times until it's a nice ball., Then you're going to use a bench scraper to lift your dough ball and place it upside down in a floured banneton. (Or you can also use a bowl with a tea towel.), Pinch the dough on the bottom to make sure it's tight.

Add the honey, olive oil, and water. Place on mixer and mix briefly to incorporate. Turn the mixer up to medium high and knead for 5 minutes. Remove the dough hook and scrape the dough into a cohesive mass using a plastic dough scraper or a rubber spatula (or scrape into another bowl). Cover and place the bowl in a warm, draft-free area and allow it to rise (proof) for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in volume., Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight, but up to 10 days., On baking day, remove the dough from refrigerator and dump it out onto well-floured surface. Knead until fairly smooth, adding more flour as necessary. If not using the psyllium husks, it will be a somewhat sticky dough so keep a small bowl of flour on hand to sprinkle the dough and/or surface with extra flour., To shape into a boule, simply form into a round ball, pulling the dough up and under the ball and pinching on the bottom. Place on parchment paper. To shape into a baguette, smooth the dough and roll into a rope shape, tapering it at the ends, adding more flour as necessary.

Place a baking steel or stone (or overturned baking sheet) onto the middle rack with a shallow pan on a rack underneath. Preheat the oven to 450° F., DUTCH OVEN METHOD: Place a Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid into the oven and preheat it to 500° F. You won't need the shallow pan with steam as enough steam will be created in the Dutch oven once the bread goes in. NOTE: This will only work with boules or loaves that can fit into the Dutch oven. If you're making a longer batard or baguette, you'll need to use the first method., When the dough has finished rising and is visibly puffed, run a serrated knife under hot tap water and cut slits in the dough swiftly but uniformly, about ½-¾ inch deep., BAKING STEEL OR STONE METHOD: Fill a measuring cup with one cup of very hot water (from the tap is fine). Using a pizza peel (paddle), slide the loaf (or loaves) onto the baking steel (or stone), parchment and all. Immediately pour the cup of very hot tap water into the shallow pan. Quickly shut the oven door., DUTCH OVEN METHOD: Remove the lid carefully and carefully lower the dough, parchment and all, into the Dutch oven. Replace the lid and shut the oven door. Immediately reduce the temperature down to 450° F., BAKING STEEL OR STONE METHOD: Bake for about 30 minutes for baguettes, or about 40 minutes for boules, OR longer for larger boules (some larger boules can take up to an HOUR or more). If the loaves are getting too browned, you can cover them loosely with foil. The loaves will look crusty and done on the outside, but will feel light when picked up. If they feel heavy, they're not done yet. Allow them to bake for another 5-10 minutes and then check again, picking up the loaf with two gloved hands. If they're still feeling heavy, allow them to bake for another 5 minutes and check again., DUTCH OVEN METHOD: Bake the bread for 40 minutes with the lid on. Remove the cover and continue to bake for another 20 minutes. Check for doneness by picking up the loaf (with gloved hands). If the loaf feels relatively light for its size, it's done. If it feels at all heavy, it's not done and give it another 5-10 minutes before checking again., Remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack.

Using your fingers, gently press each ball into a 10"" circle, being careful not to touch the outer edge of the dough.It is important not to touch the outer edges of the dough to help ensure that puffy, airy crust that we are striving for. Simply press from the center of the dough outward until you have reached twelve inches., Carefully, transfer the pressed dough onto a 13"" piece of parchment paper.

Finish with fresh mozzarella slices mixed in-between the pepperoni., Bake the Pizza, Using the pizza peel, slide the pizza (and parchment paper) onto the hot baking stone in the preheated convection oven. Bake for 6-7 minutes until the crust is charred and the mozzarella cheese is lightly browned.It always seems that I remove the pizza too soon from the oven and wish that it had baked longer. I have learned that when I think it is done, to bide my time and allow it to bake just a little bit longer. So, maybe 8 minutes, tops., Remove the pizza from the oven and place it on a serving tray, discarding the parchment paper from underneath. Keep warm, uncovered, until ready to serve., Repeat with remaining pizzas.

Stir it all together for about a minute into a shaggy dough with no dry spots. Gather the mass into a ball and cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel., Let dough rest for 5 minutes, then uncover the bowl and use a wet hand to reach underneath the dough, and pull the bottom of the dough, stretching it up and over the top of the dough.

Wait 5 minutes and do it again, then another 5 minutes, and do a fourth and final stretch. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 40 minutes. Then chill the dough for at least 12 hours, or up to 72 hours. This will help develop flavor over the long rise., About 3 hours before you want to serve your pizza, prepare your cast iron pan. Pour a couple tablespoons of olive oil into a well-seasoned, 10-inch cast iron skillet. Spread the oil over and around the pan, and up the sides, anywhere the dough is going to touch as it rises. Transfer the dough to the pan and flip it in the pan to coat with the oil. Press the dough gently to the edges of the pan, using the tips of your fingers to dimple the dough as you work it. At this point, the dough will shrink back from the sides, but cover with plastic wrap, let rest 15 minutes, and repeat. Then rest another 15 minutes and repeat again., Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature. About 30 minutes before you plan to start baking, place one oven rack at the top of the oven about below the heating element or broiler, and one at the bottom of the oven. Now is a good time to also preheat the oven to 450°, if your oven takes time to climb to that temperature, like mine., When it’s time to bake, sprinkle about 1 cup of the cheese over the dough, crust to crust, to the edges of the pan. Drop spoonfuls of the pizza sauce on top of the cheese, then cover with the remaining cheese. Place the pepperoni as desired, then bake on the bottom rack for 20 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling away and crust is golden brown. You will need to use a spatula to lift up the crust and check., If the bottom is golden but you want to brown the cheese a bit more, move the pizza to the top rack and bake another few minutes; if the top is done but the bottom isn’t yet golden, keep the pizza where it is for another few minutes. I usually find that my pizza is where I want it after 20 minutes, but use the extra few minutes to get the pepperoni extra crispy, the way I like it., Once the pizza is done to your liking, remove from the oven and let sit for a few minutes to cool to where you can touch it without hurting yourself. Run a knife around the edges to make sure no cheese is sticking, then drizzle with the honey, top with torn basil, and grate a good amount of parmesan or pecorino over the top.

Frozen cauliflower florets can also be thawed ahead of time and used instead, you'll just need to ""rice"" it by processing it briefly in a food processor, before proceeding to the next step., FRESH METHOD: If you're using fresh cauliflower, you'll need to steam it first. Fill a large pot with an inch of water, then place a steamer basket over that. Fill the basket with the fresh cauliflower florets and bring the water to a boil. Once boiling, cover the pot and lower the heat to a simmer. Cook until the cauliflower is very tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and transfer the cauliflower to a food processor. Process it briefly to make cauliflower ""rice."" Continue as directed, though you might want to let the cooked cauliflower cool so you don't burn your hands when wringing it out., Transfer the thawed or cooked cauliflower rice to the center of a thin dish towel, or place it in a nut milk bag. Use your hands to squeeze the rice, removing all of the excess moisture from the cauliflower. There should be quite a lot of liquid that comes out, close to 1/2 cup., Place the drained cauliflower in a large bowl, then add in ground flax or chia seeds, almond flour, salt, garlic and dried oregano. Stir well to mix, using your hands if needed to make it stick together. You can add a tablespoon of water if needed, but I typically don't add any extra liquid when I use my hands to mix this dough., Press the mixture into the parchment-lined baking sheet, using your hands to shape the crust into your desired size. The thinner and flatter you can press the crust, the better, but try to keep it as even as possible for a sturdy result. I typically get a crust that is 12 to 14 inches in diameter from this recipe., Bake the crust at 400ºF for 45 minutes, checking on it after 30 minutes to make sure it's not starting to burn. You want the crust to be dry to the touch and nicely golden. (Tip: You can roast vegetable toppings for your pizza at the same time! I put sliced tomatoes, red onion, and mushrooms on a separate pan, and take them out of the oven around the 25 minute mark so they don't burn.), For best texture, I recommend flipping the entire pizza crust over on the pan (I use the parchment paper to lift it), then return it to the oven for another 10 to 15 minutes to dry out even more. However, this is optional. I do recommend flipping over the crust either way, so that the ""dry side"" is on the bottom, making it easier to pick up with your hands later., Once the crust is firm and dry, add your favorite pizza toppings and return to the oven briefly to let everything heat up, about 5-10 additional minutes.

Loosely cover and allow to sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy and frothy on top. *If you do not own a stand mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and, in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/silicone spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula is a better choice.*, Add the flour, 2 Tablespoons (28g) melted butter, garlic powder, and salt. Mix on low speed with the dough hook attachment until combined, about 2 minutes. The dough should be thick, yet soft and slightly sticky. It should pull away from the sides of the bowl as it mixes. When it does, it is ready to knead. If, however, the dough is too sticky to handle, mix in more flour, 1 Tablespoon at a time. Make sure you do not add too much extra flour; you want a soft, slightly tacky dough., Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 6-8 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 6-8 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., Place the dough in a greased bowl (I use nonstick spray) and cover with plastic wrap, aluminum foil, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow to sit and rest for 1 hour at room temperature. Once it has rested and slightly risen, you can continue with the recipe or place the covered dough in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. More instructions in the make-ahead Note below., Preheat oven to 450°F (232°C)., Shape the dough, Punch the dough down to release any air. On a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough into a 10×15-inch rectangle (doesn’t have to be exact), about 1/4-inch thick. Don’t worry if it’s not a perfect rectangle, just make sure the dough is very thin. Carefully transfer dough to a parchment paper- or silicone mat-lined baking sheet. (You can also shape/roll out the dough directly on a silicone baking mat or a large sheet of parchment and then just transfer the whole thing to the baking sheet.), Poke your fingers all over the surface of the dough to create dimples. Brush with remaining butter., Bake for 17–20 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. It may have air bubbles—that’s ok. Remove from oven, and allow crust to cool completely or for at least 30 minutes as you prepare the toppings. As the crust cools, use the back of a spoon to press down on any large air bubbles to help flatten out the crust. As the crust cools, chop the fresh vegetables for the topping., Make the cream cheese topping, In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese and yogurt together until smooth. Beat in the dill, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Taste, and then add more seasonings if desired. Spread onto cooled crust., Vegetables & garnish, Lightly press the chopped vegetables into the cream cheese topping. Arrange any way you’d like! Sprinkle with parmesan cheese, chopped scallion, and shredded carrots (if using). If desired, sprinkle lightly with freshly ground black pepper., Cut into squares immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours before cutting and serving.

There is one way where you add the sugar to the yeast and another where you add the sugar to the flour. I have used both ways and they both work for me., Technique 1, In a bowl, add 1 cup of warm water and dry active yeast and let it stand until creamy (about 5 minutes)., In another bowl add flour, salt, and sugar. After 8 minutes take the yeast and give it a mix then add it to the flour mixture, mixing it in with a fork until sticky, add the additional cup of water a little at a time and continue to form it into a ball. Note: You may not need all of the water. Just make sure the dough is a tad bit moist. Add a little bit of flour at a time to get it to a less sticky consistency. Continue on with the steps 1-11 below., Technique 2, In a liquid measuring cup add 1/4 cup of lukewarm water, add the yeast and 2 teaspoons of granulated sugar. Check back in 10 minutes to make sure it has bubbled and foamed up. If it has then add lukewarm water up to the 2 cup mark of the measuring cup. Note: If it didn’t then you need to try another packet / jar of yeast., In a bowl blend the flour and salt, mix well. Next pour the water 1/2 cup at a time into the flour mix using your fork to blend. Continue to add as much of the water/yeast mixture that you need. Please note you may not need all of the water. You want the dough to be just a tad bit moist. Flour your hands and begin to form the round ball. Continue on with the steps 1-11 below., Continue with Steps 1-11 below, Next, sprinkle with a bit more flour and work it with your hands to make a ball. It’s not necessarily kneading per say. You are just rolling and tucking in gently to get a smooth ball, Take the dough and gently mold it into a smooth but firm ball with an elastic feel., Put the dough back into the bowl and cover with a kitchen towel and let it rise. This could take anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour. It all depends on the temperature in the house and the humidity. Since I am in Houston, Texas this takes me about 45 minutes., Once it rises take a little more flour, pat it down and roll it into a ball again., {OPTIONAL} Put the dough back into the bowl and let it rise 1 more time. When you let the bread rise twice it really makes for a better bread but if you are short on time then don’t worry about it., After you are done with all the rising, you will take the dough and put it on the parchment paper that is on a baking tray. The dough should be elongated and oval-shaped, with tapered and rounded (not pointed) ends., Take about 1 tablespoon of olive oil and coat the dough with it. This will make it nice and crunchy on the outside., After you rub it down with olive oil you can sprinkle a bit of sea salt or sesame seeds on top., Next, score the top of the dough with a sharp knife at a 45 degree angle.

Scrape down the sides and then add the oil, lemon juice, and salt. Pulse until everything is blended together and relatively smooth. Add a drizzle more olive oil to thin out, if desired. Taste and add pepper (and/or more salt or lemon juice) if desired. I always add a pinch of pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Yields just over 1/2 cup., Dough, Prepare pizza dough through step 3. If using store-bought frozen pizza dough, make sure it’s thawed., Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C). Allow it to heat for at least 15–20 minutes as you shape the pizza in the next step. If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well. Lightly grease a large baking sheet or pizza pan with 1/2 Tablespoon of olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor., Shape the dough, When the homemade dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half and freeze half the dough for another time—see freezing instructions in the pizza dough recipe. On a lightly floured work surface using lightly floured hands or rolling pin, gently flatten the dough into a disc. Place on prepared pan and, using lightly floured hands, stretch and flatten the disc into a 12-inch circle, about 1/2-inch thick. If the dough keeps shrinking back as you try to stretch it, stop what you’re doing, cover it lightly and let it rest for 5–10 minutes, then try again. Once shaped into a 12-inch circle, lift the edge of the dough up to create a lip around the edges. I simply pinch the edges up to create the rim. If using a pizza stone, place the dough directly on a baker’s peel dusted with cornmeal. Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for a few minutes as you gather the pizza toppings., Top & bake the pizza, Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush remaining olive oil all over the dough. Spread 1/2 cup pesto on the dough and top evenly with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes. Add a light sprinkle of salt and pepper on top., Bake for 14–15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Remove from the oven and sprinkle the chopped fresh basil all over the top of the hot pizza.

Notes: I use a tub that would usually store cereal. Also, if your tap gets pretty hot you should be able to get this temperature water without use of the stove or microwave., Add the salt to the water. Swish it around until it is dissolved., Add the yeast and let it sit there for a minute to moisten. Then swish it around until it's dissolved., Now add the flour. Mix it in by hand until it starts to come together. Then alternate folding the dough over on itself and pinching the dough apart by squeezing it between your index and middle finger. Do this for 30 seconds to 1 minute or until it is a unified mass of dough. Check the temperature, it should be about 80°F (27°C)., Let the dough rest for 20 minutes in the bowl or tub., Flour your counter and knead the dough for 1 minute until the dough has a smooth skin. Note: Need help kneading? Check this tutorial out., Lightly oil your bowl or tub, then place the dough ball seam side down. Cover tightly. Then let it rest for 2 hours at room temperature., Flour your counter again. Gently ease the dough out of the tub and onto the work surface. Use your scale to help you cut the dough into 5 equal pieces., Shape each dough ball into a tight round. To do this, take a piece of dough and stretch ⅓ of it sideways until starts to resits, then fold it back on itself into the middle. Continue doing this around the whole piece of dough until it forms a round shape. Then, flip the ball over seam side down. Cup your hands over the dough to create a dome, with your pinkie fingers pressed against the counter pull the dough 4-5 inches across the counter (unfloured) toward you. Do this 1-2 more times until the dough feels round and tight. Repeat with all five pieces of dough., Flour a baking sheet and place your shaped dough onto it. Leave space between for the dough to expand. Flour the tops of the dough then tightly cover with plastic wrap., Put the baking sheet into the fridge and let it sit there for 24 hours., Remove the pizza dough 1 hour before making the pizza, After the dough has been out of the refrigerator for 30 minutes place the pizza steel in the oven and preheat it to 550°F (290°C). Let it heat up for 30 minutes., Now make the sauce! It's the easiest part. Pour the tomatoes and salt into a blender (or use an immersion blender). Pulse on low until the tomatoes are just blended (there will be a few small chunks). You're done., Time to shape the dough! Cut a piece of parchment paper about the size of your peel., Flour your counter. Take a dough ball and use your finger tips to punch down the middle and then slowly push the dough towards the outside. Continue this motion, of using your fingertips to press the dough outward. Do it all around the dough leaving about ½ inch of the edge untouched. Then, hold the dough off of the counter with your hands at 10:00 and 2:00. The rest of the dough will hang down vertically, and the weight of it will help stretch the dough. Slide your hands all the way around the edge of the dough until it's reached your desired size, which is about 10""., Place the stretched dough onto the parchment paper and onto your pizza peel., Spoon tomato sauce onto the dough until it's about ½ inch from the edge., Use the peel to slide the pizza and parchment into the oven onto the steel. Bake for 4 minutes., Remove the pizza from the oven. You should also be able to remove it from the parchment paper if you wish., Drizzle the pizza lightly with olive oil. Top with your slices of mozzarella and any other cheeses of your liking (I like Parmesan and Burrata). Add a few slices of basil too. I've also used peppers, pepperoni and other dried meats., Use the peel to place the pizza back on the steel. Bake for 2 minutes., Switch the oven setting to broil and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until you see a few spots of charring., Remove from the oven and let sit for 1 minute., Use your pizza cutter to slice the pizza.

If you’re not using a machine, you may need to use wet hands to incorporate the last bit of the flour., Cover (not airtight) and allow to rest at room temperature until dough rises and collapses (or flattens on top), approximately 2 hours., The dough can be used immediately after the initial rise, though it is easier to handle when cold. Refrigerate in a lidded (not airtight) container and use over the next 12 days to 2 weeks., FOR THE SAUCE: Process all ingredients in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds. (Only if using whole peeled tomatoes) Otherwise you can just mix all ingredients together with a whisk. Transfer to medium bowl or container – cover and refrigerate until ready to use., Twenty to thirty minutes before baking time, preheat the oven with a baking stone at 500 to 550 degrees F. Middle placement in the oven seems to work best for me., Prepare and measure all the toppings in advance., Prepare your pizza peel with a bit of flour and cornmeal or better yet, use parchment paper sprinkled with a bit of flour and cornmeal., Dust the surface of the refrigerated dough with flour and cut off a 1 pound of grapefruit size piece of dough. Dust the piece with more flour and quickly shape it into a ball. Place ball of dough onto prepared parchment and start pressing dough from the middle, pressing outward until desired size circle is achieved. 1/8″ is best. I like to hold the dough up in front of me and turning the dough clockwise, grabbing and pulling gently on the edges of the dough as you work around the circle., (If the dough springs back and is hard to work with, you may need to let it rest for a few minutes), Place prepared pizza dough either on a pizza peel that has been sprinkled with cornmeal for easier removal or better yet, place your pizza dough that was pressed out of top of parchment paper on top of an inverted cookie sheet. (see picture tutorial on justgetoffyourbuttandbake.com), Distribute the tomatoes or tomato sauce over the surface of the dough. Scatter the mozzarella then remaining topping over the crust., Par-bake just the pizza crust for 1 to 2 minutes before adding sauce & toppings. You can easily slide the parchment paper& pizza from the cookie sheet onto the hot pizza stone. Don’t let it brown. Just let it bubble up and set the crust slightly then slide the parchment from the stone back to the top of the inverted cookie sheet to add sauce and toppings., Slide the pizza back onto the stone to continue baking. Check for doneness in 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the pizza around in the oven if one side is browning a little faster than the other. The Par-baked pizza bakes a little faster.

Proof the yeast by pouring the yeast into the water in a bowl of your stand mixer and gently stir until the yeast dissolves. *Cake yeast you make have to break up with your fingers. If using Instant Yeast, you do not need to proof it. Just add the water and yeast to the bowl and skip to step 3., Let the yeast and water stand until foamy, about 5 minutes*. If using cold water, just mix and move to the next step as the yeast won’t quite bloom with cold water., Once the yeast has bloomed (if you’re using cake or active dry yeast), add in the flour and fit your mixer with a dough hook. Mix on low just until loosely combined. Add in the salt while the mixer is running stopping if need be to scrape down the sides. After 3 minutes of mixing, drizzle in the oil., Mix until a soft, smooth elastic ball form; ~8-10 minutes. The dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl but still be wet/tacky to the touch.

Remove the dough from the bowl and place it on a very lightly floured surface.

DO NOT pop any bubbles present., Lift the dough over both knuckles and roll your knuckles under the center of the dough, working outward as you rotate the dough along your knuckles and leaving a thicker crust at the edge. Continue working the dough until a 10-12” pizza has formed. It will shrink slightly so make it a little bigger than you think. Place the dough down on a lightly floured pizza peel.

After 20 minutes, the yeast has activated, the dough is starting to rise and it’s time for the first fermentation., First Fermentation: Lightly flour your hands and a cutting board, and gently remove the dough from the bowl to the board. Kneed the dough for 30 seconds by gently folding the dough like a trifold wallet and pressing. I do this about 4 times (over 30 seconds). Begin to form the dough ball by cupping it with your hands. The seam from folding is on the bottom and the top should be smooth. Place the dough ball into a lightly oiled (we use olive oil) bowl, seam side down, and cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise somewhere warm for 2 hours., Form Dough Balls: After the 2 hours, the dough will have risen and it’s time to separate into the individual balls. We typically weigh it and divide by three. Using a pizza scraper divide the dough into 250 – 280 gram dough balls. After dividing the dough, kneed the smaller dough balls again for 30 seconds and reform into a ball. Place them onto a floured sheet pan and then flour the tops (so they don’t stick). Cover tightly with plastic wrap., Second Fermentation: Let the dough ball rise somewhere warm for 4 – 6 additional hours and then it’s ready to use for your favorite pizza recipes.","['water', 330.0, 'grams'], ['salt', 11.0, 'grams'], ['yeast', 0.5, 'teaspoon'], ['bread flour', 500.0, 'grams']"

If the dough seems sticky, let it rest for a few more minutes to let the psyllium and flours absorb. Depending on how much psyllium you use, your dough will be pretty soft but should be workable. More psyllium will make it firmer and a bit easier to work with at this point., If you want a thick crust, leave the crust in one ball and move to a greased bowl to rise. If you want thinner crusts, divide the dough into two, form into balls, and place in separate greased bowls to rise., Let rise for 3 hours at room temperature, or for up to a day in the refrigerator., When you’re ready to bake, preheat your oven with the Lodge Cast Iron Pizza Pan inside to 450°F., Lightly grease a sheet of parchment paper and place it on a large cutting board or sheet pan.

Some ideas: sliced peppers, mushrooms, olives, prosciutto, pepperoni, chicken, capers or anchovies.","Combine the warm water, caster sugar and dried active yeast together in a measuring jug, give everything a good stir and then leave the yeast to activate for 10-15 minutes (no stirring during this time). When a thick layer of foam has formed on top of the liquid (see image below), the yeast has been activated and you can move onto the next stage., Add the tapioca starch, plain gluten free flour and salt to a large mixing bowl. Stir really well to fully combine the flours. Now add the olive oil to the dry ingredients and stir through., Next pour the contents of the jug (foam and liquid) into the bowl with the flour and mix everything with a spatula or wooden spoon until you have a thick mixture. The consistency should be a cross between a dough and a thick paste (see images below) - it will not resemble classic pizza dough, as gluten free dough needs to be wetter, but have faith and don't worry if it seems like a sticky mess! Ideally, it will come away from the sides of the bowl slightly when you stir it, but if not do not stress, it'll still make great pizza., Place a clean tea towel or cloth over the top of the bowl and set aside to allow it to rise. This will take 30-40 minutes, depending on how warm the room is, so pop it in a nice warm place if you want to get a quick rise. I often start heating the oven up about 10 mins before the end of rising time, as this helps the process along (and you need a nice hot oven for pizza making)., Heat your oven to 230C (fan) and place a large oven tray on the top shelf to allow it to get nice and hot., When your dough has doubled in size, it's ready to use. Take a silicone baking mat or large piece of non-stick baking paper and place on your worktop.

Sprinkle gluten free flour over the top of the dough and flour your hands well, then use your hands and fingers to push the dough into a pizza base shape. You can make it as thick or thin as you like - the tapioca will help it hold together well once baked. I tend to make the middle quite thin and then form a little pizza crust rim around the edge. TIP: if your dough is really sticky, wet your hands before you handle it as this will stop it from sticking to your skin and create less mess., Optional: spritz a little olive oil on the parts of the dough that will form this crust. This will help them to brown in the oven., Leave the base to rest for 5 mins, to allow it to rise a little, during which time you can make the tomato sauce., Add the passata and oregano to a small saucepan, cover mostly with a lid but leave a small gap to allow steam to escape, then cook over a medium-high heat for 5 minutes to help it thicken. Remove from the heat and set aside with the lid off., Prepare your ingredients and now let's assemble that pizza! Pour the tomato sauce onto the base, then use the back of a spoon to spread it around gently (don't press too hard).

You can also let it sit all day if that works better for your schedule. I tend to make the dough in the morning quick, or when I have a minute before I pick kids up from school sometime in the afternoon, but you can also make the dough, let it rest for 30 minutes and then bake., To make the dough, first wake up the yeast by mixing the warm water, cane sugar, and yeast in a pyrex measuring cup. Set this mixture aside while you put the rest of the ingredients into a large mixing bowl. This will give the yeast time to “wake up” – it will get foamy at the top and smell yeasty if it is good yeast. See the picture above to see what it should look like., Mix the water/sugar/yeast mixture into the mixing bowl with the rest of the ingredients until everything is combined. Put a lid on the bowl, or cover it with a towel. Let the dough rest at least 30 minutes, or up to all day if you need to make it in the morning. The dough will get bigger in size after resting (see the pictures above), Make and Par-Bake the Crust, Pre-heat the oven to 450 degrees, and put the oven rack on the lowest spot it can go., Line one or two pizza pans with parchment paper. 1 pan will yield a large, 14-inch pizza.

If you are doing 1 pizza, scoop all of the dough onto the middle of the parchment paper., Next, you’ll form the crust into the shape you want. To keep the dough from sticking to your hands, pour a good palm-full of olive oil in your hand, and rub into both hands. Form the dough into a circle.

It should form a lovely froth on top when it's ready., Meanwhile add the gluten free flour, xanthan gum and salt to a large mixing bowl and stir well to combine thoroughly., When the yeast has formed a frothy top, pour the mixture into the flour mix. Use a wooden spoon to beat the mixture together - it should start to become quite sticky., Once the mixture becomes a bit claggy, add the olive oil. Continue to mix with the wooden spoon until it forms a smooth, slightly sticky dough which should come away from the side of the bowl., Cover the bowl with a piece of oiled clingfilm and then place in a warm spot for 40-60 minutes to prove. The dough should become puffy and double in size., Add the olive oil to a frying pan and place on a low heat.

A nice, hot oven is essential!, Lay a piece of baking paper on the worktop, slightly larger than the pizza you'll be making, and dust it with a little gluten free flour. For a more precise pizza shape, you can draw around a dinner plate onto the paper to use as a guide - or just freestyle it!, Dust your hands so that the dough doesn't stick to them and then gently push the pizza dough into a circle shape, around 1-2cm thick. For a stuffed crust pizza I tend to roll it about 1-2 inches larger than I want my finished pizza to be., Place a pizza mesh over the top of the pizza base, then carefully lift the baking paper and flip it over - the pizza mesh should be on the bottom, the the dough on top of that and the baking paper on top. Carefully peel off the baking paper so your base is sat on the mesh, ready to form the crust., Use your thumb to make an indentation around the whole pizza circumference, approx 1-inch in from the edge of the pizza., Cut strips of mozzarella around 1cm thick and lay them end-to-end in the indentation, until you have completed the circle., Wet the dough on the inside of the cheese, then fold the overhanging outside dough up and over the mozzarella.

The dough will look like it’s not going to come together at first, but it will. You may need to stop and scrape the sides to incorporate all of the flour. Once the dough has come together it will be wet and sticky in texture., Lightly oil a bowl and scrape the dough into the bowl. Wet your hands slightly and smooth the surface of the pizza dough. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and place it in a warm oven (turn the oven on for a few minutes and then shut it off before placing the bowl in). Allow the dough to rise for 45 minutes – 1 hour., Preheat the oven to 425º and place a pizza stone (if you have one) in the oven., Lightly flour a 14-inch round piece of parchment paper and dump the dough onto it. Sprinkle the dough lightly with flour and using wet fingers, press the dough into a 12-14 –inch round. Have patience with this part – it takes a little bit!, Once you get the dough patted out, remove the pizza stone from the oven and gently slide the pizza (still on the parchment) onto the hot stone. Brush the pizza dough evenly with olive oil., Bake the pizza with no toppings for 8 minutes. Remove the stone from the oven and gently slide the parchment onto a work surface. When you can handle the pizza, gently peel off the parchment paper. Drizzle the stone lightly with olive oil and place the pizza back onto the stone., Top the pizza as desired – I went the classic route with tomato sauce, cheese, and pepperoni!, Bake the pizza for 12-14 minutes, or until the crust is lightly browned and the cheese is bubbly.","[('water', 0.75, 'cup'), ('sugar', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('dry active yeast', 2.25, 'teaspoons'), ('gluten-free all-purpose flour', 1.75, 'cups'), ('dry milk powder', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('xanthan gum', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('kosher salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('olive oil', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('pizza sauce', None, None), ('mozzarella cheese', None, None), ('parmesan cheese', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('pepperoni', None, None)]"

(You can choose your toppings according to what's available in your pantry), Capsicum: 2 medium sliced, Red bell pepper: 1 big sliced, Pineapple: 1/2 cup diced, Onions: 1 medium. Sliced, Green Chillies: 2 chopped, Mushrooms: 2 cups chopped. Cook these for a few minutes in a pan with a few drops of oil., Olive oil( Vegans can use coconut oil): 2 tsp, Sauce: 1/2 cup. I used hot and sweet + ( You would also need sauce for the base. 1/2 cup), Cheese (Optional): 1/2 cup. Vegans can skip this.","Make the base: In a big bowl, combine everything together: flour+salt+sugar+baking powder+yogurt+oil ( do not add water just yet), combine them well. At this point, if you feel the dough would require more water then add some water slowly. Knead for a few minutes and add some more. The dough shouldn't be too wet. Knead the dough very well. The more you knead the better base you make. I give this 10-15 minutes. After making the dough, let the dough sit for an hour. Cover it with a cloth and let this rest., After an hour, start making the base. (this is a good time to preheat the oven at 200 C) If you can roll the base with a rolling pin, then great but if you can't then use your hands to flatten them. Divide the dough equally into two parts. Take one part and fold it like a ball. Now use both your hands to flatten them. You can put the ball on the working surface (make sure you put a few drops of oil on the work surface to prevent this dough from sticking) and keep pushing the dough slightly outwards. It takes time, but this is a fun and an easy way to make the base. You can also use the rolling pin in between to help you flatten. Don't make it too thin. The base should be thick like a stuffed paratha., Put the toppings. Now on the base, apply some ketchup (Oh yes, trust me it tastes fantastic) or you can apply tomato pizza base too. Totally up to you. I go with Hot and Sweet tomato ketchup. YUM! Spread the ketchup on the base, and now place the toppings. Go generous, put whatever you like. Grate some cheese, also add some seasoning of salt and pepper and a few drops of olive oil. and now your pizza is ready to go into the oven at 180 C for 30-40 minutes. But make sure you place your pizza on a silver foil, and grease the silver foil with a few drops of oil so that the base doesn't stick to it., Baking tips: I bake the pizza on the lowermost rack for 25-30 minutes, once I see the base changing color to brown, I put the pizza on the top rack for 5-7 minutes so that the toppings get slightly charred. But then this is how I do it, you bake it the first time, see how it turns out and you can make the changes in the second pizza accordingly., After the pizza is properly baking, take it out and do not cut it, this needs to sit for 5-7 minutes else you won't be able to cut this properly., Now cut the pizza into slices and serve. The pizza will be slightly different from your gluten pizza but it tastes fantastic. The base might be crispy and this is what I like, stiff and crisp.

Cover (not airtight) and allow to rest at room temperature until dough rises, about 2 hours. Dough can be used right after the initial rise, although it is much easier to handle when cold. Cover and refrigerate and use over the next 5 days., To make the pizza: Place a rack directly underneath broiler in oven; preheat to 450°. Make sure bottom of oven is accessible (that’s right, you’re going to bake directly on the bottom of your oven)., To prepare the sauce, combine the tomatoes, garlic, salt, red pepper flakes, sugar, and vinegar and blend in a blender or with an immersion blender until smooth. This will make more sauce than you need; you can save the remainder in the fridge for up to a week, or in the freezer for longer., Take a piece of parchment paper (big enough to fit a baking pan) and sprinkle with cornmeal or white rice flour.

Add in the flour, salt and olive oil and use your fingers to mix this to form a shaggy dough. We are not kneading at this point, we just want everything to be hydrated with no pockets of flour. Once mixed scrape off any dough from your fingers and cover the bowl and set aside in a warm spot for 30 minutes to rest., Once rested we are going to knead the dough. You can do this by hand for about 10 minutes, in mixer for 5-8 minutes or use the slap and fold method. If you haven’t heard of this technique before its a great method for kneading sticky doughs when you don’t have a mixer. I learnt it originally from Richard Bertinet (who has excellent bread books should you want more reading) which makes sense as this is often known as the French method. Basically you scrape the dough out onto the worsurface. Both hands go under the ought, scooping it up turning it over and slapping it dough on the counter (this basically tuns it over) the dough is then stretched back towards you a little and then folded over on itself. This motion is repeated over and over again for about 8 minutes or until the dough looks smoother and is nice and elastic., Once the dough is kneaded use a dough scraper to form the dough into a ball and place seam side up into a bowl very lightly greased with olive oil. Cover the bowl and set aside somewhere warm (26-27C is perfect) for the moment. After 30 minutes, using the techniques we learnt making our first loaf of sourdough bread, were going to preform a set of stretch and folds to build in more strength. Cover the bowl and leave for another 30 minutes before doing a second, and final, set of stretch and folds. Cover the bowl and place back in its warm spot and leave for another three hours, a total of 4 hours., After 4 hours you should be able to see some signs of fermentation, even if the dough hasn’t risen significantly. The dough should have a slight domed appearance and there should be lots of fermentation bubbles over the surface. Carefully turn the dough out onto the worksurface and use a dough scraper to divide into 4 pieces (you can weigh these if you’re looking for perfectly portioned pieces). Form the dough into balls, trying to make the shaping nice and tight so the skin on the outside of the dough is taught., Once divided and balled you need to decide if you’re going to use all four of the pizza balls tomorrow or if you want to freeze them to use at a later date. If using tomorrow simple place them into a lightly floured container, a high walled plastic box is good for this or a baking tray with high sides, something that means when covered the lid or clingfilm wont touch the dough. If freezing the balls I like to place these into small individual plastic tubs greased with little oil. Either way once in their new resting place the dough needs to sit for a further four hours, again in a warm spot around 26-27C is ideal. Once out second four hour stint is up you should once again be able to see signs of fermentation. If in the individual containers you should be able to see some rise and bubbling on the sides and if on the floured tray you should see the dough has spread out a little and there is fermentation bubbles on the surface as before. For the dough you want to use later place the containers in the freezer (for up to two weeks) and for the dough you want to use place the container in the fridge for 12-24 hours. You can leave the chilled dough for longer but after 24 hours it can be harder to handle., Once your dough has rested for its desired time it needs to come back to room temperature before using, otherwise it’ll be harder to stretch and the chill will affect how it cooks. If using refrigerated dough this means taking out the dough 4-5 hours before you want to use it. If your kitchen is in the low to mid 20’s then room temperature is fine if its colder you’ll want to leave it in a warmer spot. If the dough your using is frozen you need to think a bit further ahead. I take the dough out the day before I want to use it leaving it in there for 12-24 hours to slowly defrost and then as with the regular refrigerated dough take it out 4-5 hours before using., When ready to make pizzas get everything set up, get your toppings prepped and your workstation ready. Preheat your frying pan over medium heat for about ?? minutes (this should get it about 300C), it wants to be about as hot as you can get it. Turn on your grill and set a rack just below, giving you enough space to fit the frying pan., Carefully remove a portion of dough from its container (dough scraper is good for this if you chilled the dough on a tray) and place onto a floured surface, dusting the top of the dough too. Press your fingers into the middle of the dough, leaving the outside inch or so untouched. To stretch the dough I place it on the back of my fists, resting it on my knuckles and gently stretch it as I turn the dough. You don’t want to use a rolling pin as you’ll deflate the dough and you’ll have wasted all that time. Once stretched to about 9-10 inches carefully transfer it to the pan. The base will start to cook immediately so as soon as the base is in top it with your tomato sauce (recipe below) spreading to the edges but leaving the now puffed up crust clear. I don’t add the cheese yet because I find it releases too much water if cooked for too long. Use a spatula to keep an eye on the base and as soon as it has nicely browned spots on the base, working quickly, add your toppings. This entire cooking process should take 2 minutes, 3 max.

Add flour until you can’t mix it by hand very well., Sprinkle some flour on your table and turn the dough onto the table. Knead the dough by hand until it is smooth and elastic, adding flour as needed. This should take 6 to 10 minutes of kneading.

If you have a baking stone, put it in the oven to heat, too. I would recommend using a stone for baking this pizza. If you don’t have a stone, you can turn your biggest cookie sheet upside down (so that the flat side is up) or use a rimless sheet. If you are using a stone let the stone heat for 30 minutes. If using a baking sheet, let it heat for 10 minutes., When the oven is hot, cut your dough in half. Place half of the dough on a piece of parchment paper that is 18 inches long. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough (on top of the parchment paper) into a 12 to 14 inch circle. The dough should be about a half-inch thick. Top with 1 cup of pizza sauce, 1 1/2 to 2 cups of shredded mozzarella, and toppings of your choice., When the pizza is all ready, slide the pizza, which is on the parchment paper, onto a rimless cookie sheet or one that is upside down. This will help you get the pizza to the oven., Open the oven and slide the pizza which is still on the parchment paper, from the cookie sheet onto the hot baking stone or hot cookie sheet. I just tug on the edge of the parchment paper with my hands and slide it onto the stone. BE CAREFUL! Your oven is set to 500. It’s super hot, obviously! Make sure the babies are out of the way and be careful when sliding the pizza into the oven., Bake for 10 to 15 minutes until the top is bubbly and the edges are starting to brown. When the pizza is done, tug the edge of the parchment paper and slide the pizza back onto the cookie sheet you used to transfer it to the oven.

(See notes above if you need to skip the overnight rise for time purposes.) NOTE: It is important the dough really be slicked with olive oil especially if you are using a cloth bowl cover or tea towel as opposed to plastic wrap or a hard lid. If you are using a tea towel, consider securing it with a rubber band to make a more airtight cover. If you do not slick the dough with enough oil, you risk the dough drying out and forming a crust over the top layer., Line two 8- or 9-inch pie plates or a 9×13-inch pan (see notes above) with parchment paper or grease with butter or coat with nonstick cooking spray. (Note: This greasing step may seem excessive, but with some pans, it is imperative to do so to prevent sticking. With my USA pans, I can get away with olive oil alone; with my glass baking dishes, butter is a must.), Pour a tablespoon of oil into the center of each pan or 2 tablespoons of oil if using the 9×13-inch pan. Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center. Rotate the bowl in quarter turns as you deflate, turning the mass into a rough ball. Use the forks to split the dough into two equal pieces (or do not split if using the 9×13-inch pan). Place one piece into one of the prepared pans.

Cover the shaped dough balls with a kitchen towel and let rest for 15 minutes., On a pizza peel or large wooden cutting board, sprinkle cornmeal to dust the board. The cornmeal provides the friction needed to launch the pizza into the pizza oven. Take one piece of dough and stretch it with your hands to form a circle. Place it on top of the cornmeal and continue working it around in a circle until you a 6-8 inch pizza shape., Work quickly to top the pizza with about 2-3 Tablespoons pizza sauce (favorite sauce recipe on this post). Tear mozzarella into pieces and place pieces on top of the pizza dough. Tear the fresh basil and sprinkle with parmesan if desired. Check that the dough is not sticking to the board (this can happen if you don't work quickly enough). If it is sticking, unstick it with your fingers, add a bit of cornmeal if needed and try again., Launch your pizza into the pre-heated pizza oven with a quick thrust forward. Let the pizza cook for about 45 seconds, then using the pizza peel pull the pizza out of the oven, turn it with a fork and return it to the pizza oven for another 30-45 seconds. This ensures that the pizza is cooked on both sides. You can watch a video of this process here., Repeat the process with the rest of your pizza dough, adding whatever toppings you desire and enjoy!","[('water', 1.0, 'cup'), ('milk', 0.75, 'cup'), ('granulated sugar', 1.5, 'teaspoons'), ('instant yeast', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('olive oil', 1.5, 'tablespoons'), ('salt', 1.5, 'teaspoons'), ('type 00 flour', 4.0, 'cups')]"

Spray cut edges of squash with non-stick cooking spray, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Lay cut side down in a 9×13 casserole dish and bake for 35-45 minutes.

Remove from oven when the skin is easy to puncture with a fork., While the squash is baking, begin cooking the bacon. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a deep non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook bacon until crisp and browned, stirring occasionally. This took about 10 minutes for me, but it will vary based on the kind of bacon. Remove from the pan and set aside., Next, add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the same pan. When hot, add ground meat and use a wooden spoon or spatula to break up into small pieces as it cooks.

Remove from heat and let cool., Meanwhile, when the squash is done baking, let it cool until it’s easy to handle. Next, run a fork through the flesh – long spaghetti-like strings should appear and easily separate from the squash. Scrape all the stringy flesh from the shells and add to a large mixing bowl (should be at least 3-4 cups of squash, roughly). Discard shells, but save the casserole dish., Reserve about 2 tablespoons of bacon bits.

When your yeast mixture is nice and bubbly, add it to the bowl of the stand mixer, turn it on, and let it go for about 5 minutes. It should mix the dough and then start to knead it. The dough should be soft but not sticky; add more flour if necessary. Remove the dough from the bowl and form it into a nice ball.

To prepare Olive Sunshine's Vegan  béchamel sauce (the recipe will yield more sauce than needed), heat the olive oil on medium heat in a large pot on the stove. Add the flour as the oil heats. Whisk the flour vigorously as the mixture heats creating a roux. Add the oat milk all at once and continue to whisk until combined. Allow the sauce to come to a slow boil while stirring vigorously. Add the arrowroot as a thickener, one teaspoon at a time, until the mixture is the right consistency. Wait 1-2 minutes, while stirring, while adding the arrowroot. There may be arrowroot left over, only use if needed. The sauce should be pourable but not watery.,   Preparing the Pizza:  Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. If cooking with a stone, preheat the stone for not more than 5 minutes. While the stone is preheating, cover a workspace with semolina flour and roll out the dough to the shape and size of the pan. The dough should be 1/2 inch thickness. Using oven mitts, remove the stone from the oven and carefully cover with semolina flour. If not using a stone, lightly oil and flour the pan. Do not preheat. Place the rolled out dough on the pan and place in the oven for 4-5 minutes to precook the dough. Remove the stone or pan from the oven and set aside for a few minutes to let the steam dissipate.   While the pizza dough is precooking, heat a skillet to medium high and drizzle the remaining olive oil. Add the shallots and sauté for one minute. Add the seafood (shrimp, scallops and crabmeat) and sauté for 2-3 minutes stirring regularly. Remove from heat. The shrimp will still be slightly pink. Combine the seafood mixture with the peppers and mushrooms. Set aside.  Using a teaspoon, ladle out the bechamel covering the pizza crust. The sauce should be evenly spread but not too thick. Spread the seafood and vegetable combination evenly on the crust and sauce. Sprinkle the pecorino and goat cheese on the pizza. Place back in the oven for 7-8 minutes or until bubbling. Remove the pizza, allow to set for 2-3 minutes, sprinkle with parsley leaves and cayenne pepper if desired. Serve immediately!

The lemon juice is crucial, as it eliminates any cashew flavor., If you are using raw cashews and you don't have a high-powered blender, then you must soak them overnight in a bowl of water, drain and rinse. Otherwise, your result will be gritty and NOT creamy. A food processor usually works better with soaked cashews versus a blender that isn't very powerful.","Add the onion and ONLY 1 cup of the broth to a large pan over medium to medium-high heat. Cook for about 8 minutes until the onion is very tender. (Add a tiny bit more broth if it is cooking too fast or turn the heat down, so the onions don't burn) After 8 minutes, add the garlic and cook a couple of minutes more, stirring often. All of the broth should have evaporated by now. If not, keep letting it cook until the broth is GONE. You don't want any more liquid once it's done cooking, so the end result is thick and creamy., Add the cooked veggies (the onion and garlic) to a blender. Start out by adding JUST 1/2 cup more of the remaining broth and add the remaining ingredients (salt, pepper, cashews, starting with JUST 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice, nutritional yeast-starting with just 2 tablespoons yeast). Blend on high for a couple of minutes until very creamy and smooth. Add any more broth to reach desired consistency, if necessary. I did not. If you don't add more broth, you would likely not need any more yeast. Taste and add any more salt & pepper or lemon, if desired., Serve over preferred pasta. Note: When preparing your pasta, make sure to salt your water well, so your pasta has flavor and isn't bland, which can affect the end flavor result of the dish. I add around a tablespoon to a large pot of boiling water. Garnish with parsley, lemon zest and salt & pepper, if desired. Add any veggies you like. I like to add broccoli or even peas.

Attach the dough hook and set the speed to low and begin adding spoonfuls of the flour mixture to the yeast mixture until fully incorporated. Next, increase the speed of the stand mixer to medium and let the machine knead the dough for 5-10 minutes., Check for the right consistency. When the dough is ready, it should be soft and not sticky. A good gauge for readiness is when the bowl of your stand mixer is ""clean"" with no residual flour in it., Remove from bowl. Remove the dough from the mixing bowl and knead for 5 minutes by hand. This step is not necessary as the stand mixer already did most of the work, but it's a step I enjoy because I can adjust the consistency if a bit more flour is needed., Shape the dough. Once kneaded, shape the dough into a ball, drizzle with olive oil and put it back into the oiled bowl of the stand mixer. Cover with parchment paper (so that the dough does not stick) and a damp tea towel and let rise in a warm corner of your kitchen for 2 hours or until doubled in size. I like to let it rise in the oven with the oven light on or in the microwave., After rising. Once doubled in size, it's time to prepare the pizza., Prepare the pizza. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. After the dough has risen, divide it in two. Oil the pans and begin by stretching the dough onto the pan with your hands. This is an exercise in patience! If the dough is not spreading easily, let it sit for 5-10 minutes to relax the gluten in the flour and try again. Never use a rolling pin to spread and stretch the dough because you will deflate all the bubbles in the dough and your pizza will be dense rather than light and fluffy., Add your toppings. Add the toppings of your choice to create your pizza. Once you've dressed the pizza, let it sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. This will give the dough one last chance to rise slightly so that the pizza will be thick and fluffy. Then bake the pizza on the lower rack of the oven for 13-15 minutes or until the bottom is lightly golden brown.","[('water', 1.5, 'cups'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('yeast', 2.25, 'teaspoons'), ('flour', 570.0, 'grams'), ('salt', 1.5, 'teaspoons'), ('olive oil', 2.0, 'tablespoons')]"

The thicker the yogurt, the thicker the cheese. You can also use soy or coconut.), 1/2 cup (75g) raw, unsalted cashews, 1/2 packed cup (120g) of cooked, peeled and mashed gold potato (You are weighing the 120 grams AFTER you've cooked/peeled & mashed the potato), 1/4 packed cup (50g) cooked white rice, 1/2-1 tablespoon (15g) distilled white vinegar-use 1/2 for mild tang and 1 for extra tang (this is key to the cheesy flavor, so don't sub), 1 teaspoon (5g) fresh lemon juice, 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt (This is KEY to the cheesy flavor, so don't omit or reduce so it stands out on pizza and in grilled cheese, etc.), Please weigh your ingredients if possible, so you get the exactly right ratios for this cheese to turn out perfectly! You don't need to use the cups to compare measurements, just simply use my gram weights listed. I literally just put my Vitamix on my scale, hit zero, and add each ingredient, hitting zero in between each addition. SO easy and fast., I use this scale.","First, if you don't have a high-powered blender, you will need to soak the cashews overnight in a bowl of warm water so they can be really soft. Otherwise, you will end up with a gritty cheese. No need to soak if you have a Vitamix., Cook the rice and potato. I just popped a couple of potatoes in the microwave wrapped in a wet paper towel and cooked until really soft. Let cool and then peel the skin off and weigh 120 grams (a packed 1/2 cup) and add to a blender or a food processor if you don't have a high-powered blender. For the rice, you can use those frozen white rice packets that cook in 3 minutes or use some already cooked white rice. Just make sure it is not cold stiff rice from the fridge, or it will be hard to blend it up smoothly. Just briefly warm it in the microwave and make sure it is a thick/sticky rice., Add the broth first to the blender, this will make for easier blending. Add the yogurt, cashews, potato, rice, vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Blend on high until 100% smooth, thick and creamy, as pictured. You may need to scrape down the sides a couple of times to get it going. Taste that amazingness! Rich, creamy, tangy and a bite of salty. The salt is important so that it stands out in grilled cheese sandwiches and on pizza, since technically you aren't eating it on its own. While it tastes amazing straight out of the blender, wait to fully judge it on pizza and grilled cheese! It should be thick, gooey and creamy. You can use it right away or place in the fridge to firm up a bit and use it in any of the options below., TO USE FOR GRILLED CHEESE OR QUESADILLAS: This method is different and requires time prep in advance, so please read through. Since grilled cheese is only briefly heated on the stove, the cheese sauce is a bit too runny to use right away for grilled cheese. So, to create a firmer cheese, you will line a 6 inch round cake pan with parchment paper (as pictured) pressing it along the sides of the pan to fit flat. Pour the blended up cheese sauce in the pan and bake at 350°F for 10 minutes. This firms up the cheese just a bit, making it less saucy. This allows the cheese to get more thick/firm and less saucy and not ooze out all over the place when you make the grilled cheese or quesadillas. You can use it right away or put in the fridge to firm up even more before using. When ready to make, spread a generous thick layer (several spoonfuls) onto the bread and heat over the stove until browned on both sides. I use a nonstick pan. Spread a thick layer on the bottom of a large tortilla, add toppings and another thin layer on the top tortilla. The cheese will help them to stick., TO USE FOR PIZZA: The cheese is the perfect consistency to use on pizza right after blending, as it's very easy to spread and drizzle or dollop. I always use my Homemade No Yeast Pizza Crust (which is pictured in the post). Simply add the pizza sauce to your pizza crust and all the toppings you want. Then drizzle/spoon the cheese sauce all over the pizza. You want to be generous with adding on top of the pizza, so you really taste the cheese in every bite. Bake at 400°F until the cheese is starting to look firm and a bit brown on top. The bake time can vary depending on which crust you use, but I always cook my pizza at 400°F for 15-20 minutes or so until the cheese and crust are golden. It browns beautifully., TO USE AS A DIP: You can use it right away from the blender, as it should be warm from blending it up. You can always blend it longer to warm it up, or just heat it over the stove for 3-5 minutes on medium-low just to warm through or thicken it slightly more if desired. Although, it should already be quite thick and creamy as is and it will firm up in the fridge overnight.","[('veggie broth', 120.0, 'g'), ('yogurt', 60.0, 'g'), ('cashews', 75.0, 'g'), ('potato', 120.0, 'g'), ('rice', 50.0, 'g'), ('vinegar', 15.0, 'g'), ('lemon juice', 5.0, 'g'), ('salt', 0.75, 'teaspoon')]"

Add the water and oil and stir with a rubber spatula until a shaggy dough forms. Use your hands to knead the dough briefly in the bowl, then turn the dough out onto a work surface and continue kneading until the dough comes together and feels tacky to the touch, about a minute. Alternatively, you can do this all in your stand mixer, which will take roughly 3 minutes total. (The stand mixer is my preferred method.), Place the dough back in the mixing bowl, cover with a towel or bowl cover and let rise in a warm spot for 1 hour. Longer is fine, too. Dough will not necessarily double in volume. This is fine., Heat oven to 425ºF., Turn dough out onto a work surface and portion into 12 pieces, using flour as needed if dough is sticky. Note: If you want identically sized pretzels, weigh your total dough, then divide by 12. (Each portion should roughly weigh 75 grams.) Also: Be careful about using too much flour here: it will make it difficult to roll out…just use a sprinkling to prevent the dough from sticking., Roll each portion into a 12-inch (roughly) log. You’ll roll each piece longer afterward, but the brief rest will allow the gluten to relax, making them easier to roll out longer later., Once all the portions have been rolled, continue to roll each portion to 22 to 24 inches long. Twist each piece into a pretzel shape. See video or photos for guidance. At this point, I like to transfer the shaped pretzels to a lightly oiled sheet pan., When all of the pretzels are shaped, dissolve the 1/2 cup of baking soda in 4 cups of hot water. You can use hot tap water here or boil 4 cups of water — I’ve been using my electric kettle. Stir to dissolve the baking soda., Line two sheet pans with parchment paper., Working with one pretzel at a time, drop it into the water. Use a spider to remove it and transfer it to a parchment-lined sheet pan. (Note: I like to drop the pretzel in top-side down, then I use the spider to remove it and flip it onto the sheet pan top-side up. I find dipping it top-side down ensures the top of the pretzel gets sufficiently coated in the baking-soda solution, which promotes more even browning.) Repeat until all pretzels have been dipped., Sprinkle pretzels with salt. Transfer pan — I like to bake one pan at a time — to the oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden., Remove pan from the oven and immediately brush the hot pretzels with the melted butter.

Bake for 15-20 minutes, checking often, or until the pizza crust is crispy and golden on the bottom and the cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown. Remove from oven and allow to rest for a few minutes., For the Balsamic Glaze:, While the pizza is baking, cook the balsamic vinegar and sugar together in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes.

It should foam well on the top as it is whisked., Next, add the dry ingredients and beat well to blend (preferably using an electric whisk with a dough hook attachment). If you don't have a dough hook, use a sturdy silicone/wooden spoon and beat hard until well blended. The mixture should look like a runny porridge when done., Place the bowl to one side and leave to stand untouched for a full 10 minutes. This is important and will enable the flours to absorb the liquid and hydrate fully., Prepare the pizza ingredients, While the dough is hydrating, prepare the filling ingredients., In a small bowl, mix together the tomato puree and Passata. The recipe includes both as on their own, the puree is too thick and the passata is too thin. Add the passata to the puree a little at a time and mix between each addition until you have a consistency which is easily spreadable, but not too liquid., Grate the cheddar and mix with the grated mozzarella. Set aside., Drain and chop the sun-dried tomatoes., Re-beat the dough thoroughly, After the dough has hydrated, beat the mixture hard again (with dough hook or spoon) until stiff and holding its shape. The dough ‘batter’ will resemble very thick porridge and will hold its shape. Set aside., Rolling and filling the dough, Lay a large piece of good quality non-stick baking paper on the counter-top to work on., Lightly oil the surface of a large rolling pin., Preferably wearing close-fitting vinyl food gloves, lightly oil the hands with a tiny drop of olive oil., Divide the dough into two halves. Take the first half and gently work and knead in your hands until it becomes a smooth dough., Place the kneaded piece of dough on the baking paper and flatten into a rough rectangle shape., Using the rolling pin, roll the dough into a rectangle approximately 35 cm x 25 cm (14 inches x 10 inches). If the pin starts to stick, rub a drop more oil into the pin's surface., Using the back of a spoon, spread half the tomato puree mix across the whole surface of the rolled dough., Next, sprinkle half the cheese across the top, leaving a 2 cm (1 inch) border clear of extra toppings down the straightest long side. (See photo in main blog post), Sprinkle half of the chopped sun-dried tomato on top of the cheese., Roll the filled dough into a spiral, Turn the rectangle on the baking paper so that the long 'un-topped' edge is closest to you., Turn the opposite side of the dough over on itself by about 1½ cm (½ inch) all the way along. Support the turn by pulling up the back of the baking paper to hold it in place., With the help of the baking paper, continue to roll the dough over into a spiral as tightly as possible towards you, pulling the baking paper to help you as you go. Push the last edge into the dough roll to hold it together, but don't smooth as you may wish to further tighten each roll after cutting., Cutting the dough into rolls, Next, cut the spiralled dough sausage into 8 equal pieces. If the ends are particularly uneven, these can be trimmed off first as preferred., To cut, use a very sharp knife that has been lightly rubbed with oil, or a piece of baker's twine/string. Mark out eight even pieces by scoring the top before you start. Then cut through one by one., If having cut the dough, the spirals look like they need to be tighter, take each in turn and (while on the baking paper), carefully loosen the join and unroll, re-rolling more tightly. Use hands to hold the filling into the sides as you roll, so that it doesn't get lost., Carefully transfer the dough pizza rolls to a prepared baking sheet. Leave a reasonable gap (a couple of cm) between each for expansion when they rise. Arrange in rows to bake on a baking sheet or in a round tin, place one roll centrally and the others evenly round the sides., Lightly drape a large piece of clingfilm over the dough rolls (be sure the rolls are not restricted) and set to one side., Repeat the process for the second half of the dough and fillings, Repeat the kneading, rolling and filling process with the remaining dough and filling ingredients. When transferred to the baking sheet/tin, cover with clingfilm as instructed above., Proving the pizza rolls, Place the trays in a warm place to prove for about 45 minutes to an hour (dependent on room temperature), until the dough rolls are nearly double in size. (If the room temperature is very cold, you can speed the process by placing the tray over a bowl of steaming (but not boiling) water., Egg-wash and decoration, While the rolls are proving, prepare the egg-wash by lightly beating an egg with a little milk., Pre-heat the oven to 190 C/375 F/Gas 5.

Cover with plastic and set in a warm place for an hour, until doubled in size (I use the proof setting on my oven)., Preheat oven to 500°F (or preheat a pizza oven) with a pizza stone on the bottom rack.

Whatever you use, have it in the oven while preheating., Divide the dough in two and shape each half into a disk. On a sheet of parchment paper, roll each crust into a 13-inch round using a rolling pin. Fold the outer ½-inch edge over and crimp/seal the roll onto the bottom to create a crust edge (see pictures). Prick the bottom a few times with a fork to avoid large air pockets. Repeat with second crust., Dust a flat cookie sheet with cornmeal and carefully remove the pizza crust from the parchment paper and transfer it onto cornmeal-coated sheet.

With the machine running, slowly pour in the milk mixture. Add the flour and salt. Continue mixing until a rough, sticky dough forms, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes., After the dough has rested, switch to the dough hook. Knead on medium-low speed for 6-8 minutes (I use #2 or #3 on my stand mixer). The dough should feel soft, supple and pull away from the sides of the bowl when ready. If it’s too sticky add a small bit of flour., Bulk Rise, Transfer the dough to a medium-size bowl coated in butter. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise overnight until double in size, about 8-12 + hrs. @ 67-68 F, depending on temperature., Stretch and Fold the Dough (optional step): about 30 minutes- 1 hr. into the bulk rise stretch and fold the dough: grab a portion of the dough and stretch it upward. Fold it over toward the center of the bowl. Give the bowl a 1/4 turn; stretch and fold the dough again. Continue this technique until you’ve come full circle around the bowl (4 folds total). For video guidance, click here. This optional step will increase the overall volume of the rolls and aerate the dough., Roll the Dough, In the morning: Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper. I like to scrunch the paper into a ball first, open it up, and then line the inside with enough excess to hang over the sides for easy removal. It tends to fit better this way., Lightly oil and flour your countertop to prevent sticking. Coax the dough out of the bowl. Gently pat into a rough rectangle. Let rest for 10 minutes for easier rolling., Dust the dough (and your rolling pin) with flour. Roll the dough into a 16 x 12-ish rectangle using a tape measure for accuracy. If the dough resists, let rest for 5-10 minutes and try again., Make the Cinnamon-Sugar Filling, If using the softened butter variation (listed in the notes above): add 84 g (6 tbsp) softened butter to a small bowl. Mix with the sugar, cinnamon and flour. With an offset spatula, spread onto the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges., If using the melted butter version: brush the entire surface of the dough, including the top, bottom and sides with 28 g (2 tbsp) melted butter. Use all of it. Combine the sugar, cinnamon and flour in a bowl. Sprinkle the mixture onto the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Smooth it out with your hands until it looks wet and sandy., Shape & Cut the Dough, Starting on the long side of the dough (16-inch), roll it into a log pressing down gently as you go. Take your time with this step. The log needs to be tight so the swirls stay in tact. You should end up seam side down. TIP: if the dough starts to get sticky from the heat of your hands, lightly oil or flour your fingertips, take a deep breath and try again., Cut the dough into 2-inch sections using a oiled knife or bench scraper. I lightly “mark” the dough first to make sure each piece is roughly the same size., Second Rise, Place the rolls into the lined pan and let rest for 1- 2 hours, or until the dough puffs up. Alternatively, if you’d like to chill or freeze the rolls, please refer to the “Make-Ahead” option in the Baker’s Schedule at the top of this recipe., Bake the Cinnamon Rolls, Preheat oven to 350 F. Bake the dough onto the center rack and bake for 35-40 minutes (check at the 30 minute mark). The tops should turn light golden brown when ready., Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 15 minutes. This helps the butter to absorb back into the dough. Then lift up the rolls, while still on the parchment paper, and transfer to a wire rack., Make the Glaze, While the rolls are baking or cooling make the glaze. Add softened butter, whipped cream cheese and sifted powdered sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat until smooth, thinning out the consistency with a little milk as needed. The ingredients must be soft and at room temperature for best results., To serve, top the rolls with some of the glaze or lightly dust with powdered sugar. These rolls are best enjoyed slightly warm on the same day they are baked.","[('milk', 160.0, 'g'), ('butter', 28.0, 'g'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('sourdough starter', 100.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 24.0, 'g'), ('flour', 300.0, 'g'), ('salt', 5.0, 'g'), ('oil', None, None), ('butter', 28.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 100.0, 'g'), ('cinnamon', 3.0, 'tsp'), ('flour', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('butter', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('cream cheese', 1.0, 'cup'), ('sugar', 0.25, 'cup'), ('milk', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('butter', 115.0, 'g'), ('flour', 360.0, 'g'), ('butter', 6.0, 'tbsp')]"

Remove plastic wrap from the pans with the pizza dough in them. The dough should now have spread itself (or nearly spread itself) to the edges of the pan.

It should foam a bit here., While the water and yeast is sitting, measure out your flour. We’re sifting the flour, so place your sifter over a bowl to begin. Use a butter knife to level the tops of the measuring cups and push the excess flour back into your flour container or bag. Add salt to the flour. Shake it through the sifter., When the water/yeast bowl is ready, sift the flour into the bowl. Add 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Mix with a spoon until the dough becomes shaggy. My video shows this well. Once it’s shaggy enough – switch to using your hands. Rub the dough around the bowl to get the bits from the sides., Dust your cutting board with a little flour and place dough on your board. Knead the dough for 3-4 minutes. Shape it into a ball.

They should be golden brown when done. Set aside and let cool., Add flour to a clean cutting board and put dough on the board. You can cut the dough into 4 equal pieces to make 4 individual pizzas or cut in half to make two medium sized pizzas. I cut mine in half., Take each half and re-shape again to make a more round dough ball. Use your rolling pin and roll up and down the dough. I prefer making oval pizza, but if you want round – go for it. Roll dough until it’s about ¼” in thickness or slightly thinner.

Stir and set aside for 10-15 minutes until a foamy head has formed. This shows that your yeast is active and ready to make awesome pizza. No bubbles = dead yeast, best go and buy a fresh packet., In a mixing bowl or stand mixer bowl, mix the Caputo flour with the salt until well combined. Add the olive oil and contents of the jug. Now, if using a stand mixer get your dough hook on and give it a mix for a couple of minutes. If using arm power grab a wooden spoon and get mixing, then give the dough a knead with your hands. You should end up with a nice smooth, only slightly sticky dough., Now time to prove the dough. [I do mine in two stages, first in the fridge and then in the warm, as this has got the best results for me. But see the introduction on this page for some alternative options.] Cover your mixing bowl with a tea towel and place in the fridge for 2-5 hours, while you get on with other things. The cold of the fridge slows the yeast down, ensuring a nice slow prove while the dough also rests., After this chilling time, you'll see the dough will have grown in size quite a lot. Take it out of the fridge about 30 minutes (warm day)-1 hour (cooler day) before you are ready to cook. Dust your surface with corn meal and shape the dough into a nice ball shape (see images below), lightly flour a container (base and sides) with corn meal, pop your dough into it, cover with a tea towel and prove again until it has doubled in size., In the meantime, fire up that pizza oven and it'll be ready to cook on when it reaches 400C., Flour your pizza peel REALLY well with corn meal. Then press your dough out into a pizza shape, occasionally lifting and adding corn meal to the peel as you go. I found it easiest to fold back half the pizza at a time when doing this. Give the peel a gentle shake to make sure the pizza dough moves around freely, then time to add your sauce and toppings., Once you've assembled your pizza, get it straight into that nice hot oven. It should slide off the peel easily, with a couple of gentle shakes. Any issues with sticking, ease a metal spatula underneath to help release any stuck spots., Cook for about 2-3 minutes, rotating every 30 seconds or so, with the Ooni door on (this helps draw the heat forward over the pizza to encourage even cooking).

Switch to the dough hook and mix on low for 2 minutes. Dough should look fairly smooth by the end. Rest for 5 minutes. Mix for 1 minute more on low. Rest for 5 minutes., At this point the flour should be well absorbed into the dough, however it will be on the wetter side. (If you touch it, it will leave some sticky remnants on your hand.) If not, you’ll want to mix in a tablespoon or so more of water. It’s important for this dough to be well hydrated. I find that I need to add a bit more water during the dryness of the winter., Note: it’s difficult to add water into the dough after this point, but far easier to add flour later during the balling stage. This knowledge for the proper consistency will accumulate as you make the dough over and over again, and can vary by climate and season., Place dough in a bowl with enough space to double in size or this 4 qt Dough Container + Lid. If using a bowl, cover with plastic wrap to keep the dough from drying out. Store in the fridge, untouched, for 72 hours., On the day of pizza making,, about 3-4 hours before cooking, turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Cut into 6 equal parts. Form into dough balls by pulling the dough down into itself until a smooth ball forms (see video). Use enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to your hands. Place in proofing box, cover, and allow to rise at room temperature. Timing will vary depending on the temperature of your kitchen, which can change from summer to winter., The dough is ready when it easily stretches into a round pizza. Again, the more you make this, the more you’ll begin to understand timing and consistency and room temperature in your kitchen., About 1-2 hours before cooking, start the fire. Prepare the sauce, cheese, and toppings., Once the fire is ready, (the floor is 700°F and the roof is 1000°F), assemble the pies. Liberally sprinkle flour on top of a dough ball. Using a spatula or pastry bench, carefully slide under the dough ball to remove from the tray. On a well floured surface, place the dough ball and coat with flour for easy handling. Liberally sprinkle a pizza peel with cornmeal and set nearby. Gently press your fingers into the dough ball to loosen the dough. Toss 1-2 times or gently shape dough by using a bit of gravity. Hang the dough, rotating quickly, for the final stretch. Leave about 3/4-inches of protected area for the crust. Make sure dough is adequately floured (no wet spots) before placing on the prepare pizza peel. Give the peel a little shake to make the dough will slide. If it sticks, carefully pull up sticky spots and add more cornmeal., Add a light coat of sauce. Top with cheese(s) of choice. We’ve come to prefer grated mozzarella as opposed to fresh for the even distribution and saltiness, with a light dusting of pecorino. Add toppings as desired, being sure not to weigh the pie down too much., With the coals moved to the side of the oven and the floor brushed clean, slide the pizza into the oven. Using a rounded pizza peel, spin the pizza in the circular motion every so often for even crust browning. I like my crust slightly charred. If you don’t, remove the pizza earlier. If the pie needs extra heat on the top, place the pie in the roof of the oven for a second. Serve immediately., If serving pizza as a sit-down meal like we often do, make the pizzas slightly ahead of time and reheat just before serving by holding them to the top of the oven, using a peel. If trying this route, you’ll want to skip any charring on the first round and save this for the second heat.","[('flour', 5.5, 'c'), ('salt', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('yeast', 1.5, 'tsp'), ('water', 2.25, 'c'), ('oil', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('sauce', None), ('mozzarella', None), ('pecorino', None)]"

I make my own sauce, find the recipe on the website, ● Mozzarella 500 g, ● Toppings for pizza 500 g any you prefer","Two or three days before baking the pizza, make the dough as follows: - in a large bowl, weigh 650g of flour and combine with 15g of salt;, - dissolve 2g of dry yeast in 450ml of water. Leave for 5 minutes, then pour over the flour with salt;, - mix with a spoon or spatula at first;, - transfer this sticky dough to the kitchen table and knead without any more flour, just use a spatula or a knife when it sticks to the table;, - after two or three minutes of kneading, the dough becomes smooth, not sticky, uniform and very easy to work;, - place in a plastic or biodegradable bag, seal tightly and leave in the fridge for two or three days., Three hours before baking the pizza, meaning before you actually shape and place the pizza in the oven, remove the dough from the fridge. Divide into five roughly equal parts. In this picture, there are more. When there are many people at the table, I bake ten pizzas in the oven and the picture was taken on one of these occasions., Shape the dough into five balls. Place on a tray dusted with flour (see the large space between them). Brush with a little olive oil, or any other oil, so that they won't form a skin while they rise., Cover with cling film or a bag and let proof for three hours at room temperature., Meanwhile, light the wood-fired oven. Find all the detailed instructions, especially for the pizza in this post about How to fire-up the wood oven., To handle the pizza in a wood-fired oven, I use a wooden spatula, on which I shape the pizza, then place in the oven. Later, I use another metal spatula with which I turn and remove the pizza from the oven (available to buy online). You can also use just a metal spatula, but the dough sticks to it quite fast, especially when you are a beginner., In a bowl, prepare the mozzarella, grated or crumbled, and the tomato sauce for the pizza in another. Put some plain white flour in a deep plate or, in a more advanced stage, you can use Italian semolina flour, from durum wheat., Of course, prepare any toppings you like - ham, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, basil, corn etc., The wood-fired oven is ready for baking. Read my post carefully, clean the oven inside and keep an active fire on the side at all times while you are working and baking the pizza. In the simple version of a classic electric oven, improvise as I explained in Gennaro's recipe, step 10., Lightly flour the wooden (or metal) spatula., Take a ball of dough from the tray and dip in the deep plate with flour we prepared earlier. Coat well on all sides, then shake off the excess flour., Place the ball on the floured spatula and carefully press with your fingers starting from the middle towards the edges. Try to leave about 1-1.5cm from the border, without pressing., Then, by various methods (find many videos on Youtube) using only your hands, spread out the pizza sheet as thinly as possible. Don't use the rolling pin!, Brush the pizza top with tomato sauce, leaving 1cm from the border., Put a layer of mozzarella., After that, top with anything you like. Here I made a simple Margherita pizza with cherry tomatoes., With short and light movements, shake the spatula with the pizza on it and throw it in the hot oven. Also, on YouTube you can find a short video of how Jamie Oliver puts the pizza in the oven, with a kind of short and firm shaking movement. Don't worry, you'll learn quickly, even if you'll be a bit nervous with your first pizzas :), Don't move and stay there from the moment you put the pizza in the oven. In a few seconds, it begins to bake actively, the temperature in the oven is now approximately 350-400 degrees C., In about half a minute, you can already take the pizza on the metal spatula and carefully turn over. It browns very quickly, and even burns if you are not careful, on the side facing the fire. For this reason, you must turn it three or four times, during which time it bakes evenly on all sides. That would be about three minutes in total and that's how long it stays in the oven until it's done., Here the pizza's ready, with the edge evenly raised and browned everywhere and the mozzarella melting and boiling., Right after removing the pizza from the oven, first place on a thick kitchen towel, leave for two minutes, then move onto a wooden board. We use the towel method to get rid of the possible small particles of coal that may stick to the pizza while in the oven, so that you won't find them between your teeth when eating., Slice the pizza and enjoy. Notice the airy edges with blistered bubbles and the crust so thin where the topping is - the perfect texture for an Italian vera pizza! Continue with the rest of the pizza tops. Don't forget to keep the fire in the oven permanently active. With each pizza, you'll become a true pizzaiola and it's really worth all the effort. I hope all this information is useful for your wood-fired oven pizza adventure. It's a very beautiful process, always with delicious results.

In a smaller bowl, pour your water in, add your olive oil and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Give it a gentle stir and leave alone for about 5 min. A good sign that the yeast is good is that the yeast will cause a foam to start forming on top of the water., For the hand mixing method:, In the large bowl with the flour and salt. Make a well in the center, and slowly pour in the water/yeast mixture. With a fork or spoon, start to bring it all together until well mixed., On a floured surface, scrape your dough out and with floured hands start to knead until smooth and elastic. If you need to add more flour only use a dusting, you don't want to change your dough's consistency by adding too much flour. Don't overwork the dough. About 3 -5 mins of kneading are sufficient., For the stand mixer method:, Using the hook attachment, place the mixing bowl in place, locked, then pour in the water yeast mixture and start off mixing at the lowest speed until it starts to combine. Increase the speed to medium and allow to mix for 3 - 5 minutes or the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl and looks smooth and elastic., Let it rise:, Place your dough in a flour-dusted large bowl, top with a damp kitchen towel, and leave to rise for 30 min - 1 hr or until it has doubled in size., After the dough has doubled in size, scrape back out of the bowl onto a floured surface and punch down the dough to get the air bubbles knocked out., Form dough into a smooth ball and divide into 6 - 8 pizza crust bases. I usually get 8 and use half now, then wrap each of the remaining pizza bases in plastic wrap and freeze for later from this point., Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the minced garlic and Calabrian peppers, and saute for 2 -3 minutes., Add in the can of tomatoes (do not strain), along with the oregano and basil, simmering for about 20 minutes. Set aside until ready to use or keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week., Prep your toppings! Chop anything that needs chopping, and have the topping ingredients lined up and ready to go., Place the pizza stone in the pizza oven, or in the oven, and heat until the appropriate temperature is reached. If on the grill, light it up accordingly, put the grate in place, and top with pizza stone, allow to get to temperature. *Tip: For pizza ovens, temps should reach 750 - 900°F; for the grill ~ about 500 - 600°F; and for the oven ~ 450 - 550°F., Start rolling out the pizza bases no more than 30 minutes before you are ready to cook them. Working with one pizza base at a time, on a lightly floured surface, roll or stretch out each pizza base until it's about 10 - 12 inches in diameter. *Tip: If you're making this in a pizza oven, for the best crust, it needs to be thin and about 8 - 10 inches in diameter for best results. I like to leave a rim around the edge that is a little thicker. I find it best to use a wooden pizza paddle that is lightly floured when topping my pizzas, as this makes transferring an aluminum pizza peel (for use with a pizza oven) or pizza stones much easier., Once the base is ready, place on a lightly floured wooden pizza paddle or chopping board and start topping.

And make sure there is enough rice flour underneath the dough so that you can move it on to the peel before you add the toppings. Otherwise you’ll get the toppings on and then your dough will be stuck to the peel., Layer on your toppings starting with a couple tablespoons of pizza sauce and then your favorites: tomatoes, basil, fresh mozzarella are a great place to start.

This is a 1:1:1 starter preparation, but other builds are fine too. Mark your jar with a rubberband and let it sit at room temperature for 4-8 hours until roughly tripled., Mixing and First Rise, Mix the ingredients, including the 120g of mature starter, together by hand, or in a mixer with the dough hook attachment, until everything is incorporated and forming a ball around the hook., Scrape the dough out onto a floured counter and knead it for 3-5 minutes, adding a small amount of flour until the dough is manageable., I prefer to hand knead the dough, but if you want to keep the dough in your mixer for 5-10 minutes until it passes the windowpane test, that is fine too. Covering it while it's still shaggy, and doing several rounds of stretching and folding over the course of a couple of hours is also an option., Lightly oil a bowl, dab the ""top"" of your dough ball in the oil, then lay the bottom side down in the bowl and cover., Let the dough rise until it has approximately doubled. I tend to leave the dough at room temperature for a few hours and then put it in the refrigerator for a day or so, and finally pull it out when it is fully risen or close to fully risen and just needing a few more hours at room temperature., The bulk fermentation can be just a few hours if you use warm water and have a warm house or put the dough in a lit oven, or this can be five days if you use sleepy starter and put the dough in a 37F refrigerator. I did the latter recently, and the pizza was tasty-sour and the crust perfectly bubbly., Preshape and Second Rise, When the bulk fermentation is finished, lightly oil a 9x13 baking pan and your counter., Scrape out the dough onto the oiled counter, gently press out most of the air, and divide the dough into 4-5 pieces. The total dough weight is approximately 1140g. This makes five approx. 225g or four 285g pizzas. (You can go larger and smaller, but you may need to adjust cook time.), Form each piece into a ball by folding the sides of the piece inward. Then hold the ball in one hand with the taut top on your palm, while you pinch the bottom pieces together with your other hand., Place the balls in the oiled pan seam-side down, and cover or put the entire pan in a plastic bag. The final proof can be at room temperature for 45-90 minutes or in the refrigerator for 8-12 hours. Various combinations of room temperature and cold proofing work, and a lot depends on how warm the dough was when you shaped it, and if your room temperature is very warm. Even in a heat wave, I've not seen a big difference in pizza outcome when the first dough ball of a batch was formed into a pizza and cooked an hour before the last dough ball., Topping Prep, 45-90 minutes before the dough is finished proofing, set up your toppings and the area where you will be stretching and ""decorating"" your pizza. My preferred pizza sauce is NYTimes Classic Marinara plus 6 ounces of tomato paste (sometimes I skip the paste). I like to make it ahead of time, and simply pull it out of the refrigerator to warm up a bit when I'm setting up the toppings., Shaping and Baking (by oven type), Wood-Fired Oven, About 30 minutes before your dough is finished proofing, fire up your pizza oven. Make sure your Uuni or other pizza oven is clean and ready to go -- the stone tiles have been brushed off, and the charcoal/wood tray has been emptied., Have everything you need on hand: kindling, charcoal, gloves, an aluminum pizza peel, and a ""hot plate"" to lay the door on (also the cast iron pan if you cook vegetables or meat too). I use a couple pieces of kindling as a rack, and steel/aluminum baking sheets and cooling racks for the pizzas that come out of the oven. (See gallery), Your damper in the chimney should be open, and the flue at the base of the chimney inside the oven should be about half open., Place 4-6 pieces of very dry kindling in the fuel area of your pizza oven. Light them and put the cover back on. Checking on them every few minutes, let them burn for about 5-10 minutes, until they are fully burning. Add about 15 pieces of lump charcoal and wait another 10 minutes or until the temperature is over 700F. About 5 minutes before cooking your pizzas, you can add wood again for an extra burst of heat. Wait a few minutes for the wood to be fully lit and the smoke to be white or clear, not black, before before loading a pizza. This entire process takes about 20 minutes, and this is what has worked for me, but you may prefer different time parameters, fuel types and amounts., Prepare your pizza peel with flour and cornmeal. Rub the flour into the wood and sprinkle the cornmeal on the top of the flour. I prefer a wood peel for prepping and loading pizzas, and an aluminum peel for removing them. A third smaller peel for turning the pizza is a helpful option, too., Remove a dough ball from the proofing pan and gently grasp one side of the circle with both hands. Holding the top edge of the circle (10 o'clock and 2 o'clock), let the rest of the dough droop/stretch downward while you then rotate and re-grab the dough like you're turning a steering wheel. This will develop about a 1/2-1 inch crust edge and stretch the middle. (Using a rolling pin is fine too.), If the dough only stretches a bit, lay it down on your floured counter for 5-10 minutes while you work on your other dough balls and check on your oven temperature. By the time you come back to the first circle, the gluten should have relaxed and you will be able to stretch it further. Try not to let any part of the dough get thin enough to see through or you may end up with a hole., Lay your pizza dough on the floured/cornmealed pizza peel. Stretch and adjust the dough a little more, aiming to position one edge of the pizza all the way at the front edge of the peel. When you insert the peel into the oven, the front edge of the dough will ""catch"" on the hot stone, making it easier to slide the peel out from under the pizza., Now top your pizza dough to your liking and put it in the oven. If you leave the pizza on the peel for more than a few minutes, it may begin to stick to the peel, so keep your assembly line moving., After about 1.5 minutes of cooking, rotate your pizza with an aluminum peel. The heat is strongest in the back of the oven near the fire, so this will encourage even cooking and char spots. After about 1.5 more minutes, your pizza is likely done., Using an aluminum peel, remove the pizza from the oven and put the pizza on a rack if not eating right away (this keeps the bottom crispy), or on a plate or a steel/aluminum sheet to serve., Repeat with the next pizza and so on. When you're finished cooking the pizzas, let the fuel burn off and the oven cool down before cleaning and storing it., See the last photo gallery for ideas for things to cook while the oven is warming up (pitas), cooling down (s'mores, garlic knots from extra dough), and still very hot (steak and veggies)., Kitchen Oven, About 30 minutes before your dough is finished proofing, preheat your kitchen oven with a baking stone or steel in it to 500F, using the top shelf if you have a top broiler. You can also use an upside-down baking sheet as your baking surface, with parchment paper under the dough, and preheated to only 450F., Flour and sprinkle cornmeal on the peel as described above, or use a square of parchment paper for each pizza., Remove a dough ball from the proofing pan and gently grasp one side of the circle with both hands. Holding the top edge of the circle (10 o'clock and 2 o'clock), let the rest of the dough droop/stretch downward while you then rotate and re-grab the dough like you're turning a steering wheel. This will develop about a 1/2-1 inch crust edge and stretch the middle. (Using a rolling pin is fine too.), If the dough only stretches a bit, lay it down on your floured counter for 5-10 minutes while you work on your other dough balls and check on your oven temperature. By the time you come back to the first circle, the gluten should have relaxed and you will be able to stretch it further. Try not to let any part of the dough get thin enough to see through or you may end up with a hole., Lay your pizza dough on the piece of parchment paper or floured/cornmealed pizza peel. Stretch and adjust the dough a little more, aiming to position one edge of the pizza all the way at the front edge of the peel if that is what you're using. When you insert the peel into the oven, the front edge of the dough will ""catch"" on the hot stone, making it easier to slide the peel out from under the pizza., Now top your pizza dough to your liking and put it in the oven. If you leave it on the peel for more than a few minutes, it may begin to stick to the peel, so keep your assembly line moving or use parchment paper., For a pizza stone or steel, bake for 7 minutes, then switch to broil for 1 minute more. Keep the oven on broil an additional minute before you load the next pizza. This helps reheat the stone before you switch back to bake mode., For a baking sheet, bake the pizza on parchment paper on the sheet for 8 minutes, then broil (still at 450F) for 1-2 minutes. Then move the pizza to a bare lower rack, removing the parchment after the transfer, and bake 3-4 more minutes., Remove the pizza from the oven with a peel, spatula, or even by tugging on a corner of the parchment paper., Put the pizza on a rack if not eating right away (this keeps the bottom crispy), or on a plate or a steel/aluminum sheet to serve., Repeat with the next pizza and so on.","[('flour', 510.0, 'g'), ('flour', 90.0, 'g'), ('water', 390.0, 'g'), ('sourdough starter', 120.0, 'g'), ('olive oil', 14.0, 'g'), ('salt', 12.0, 'g'), ('flour', 3.5, 'cups'), ('flour', 0.5, 'cup'), ('flour', 3.0, 'tbsp'), ('water', 1.67, 'cup'), ('sourdough starter', 1.0, 'cup'), ('olive oil', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('salt', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('flour', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('oil', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('cornmeal', 0.25, 'cup')]"

NOTE these bowls should be small enough so that you will be able to accurately shimmy each egg into a premade 'well' or dip you will create in each dough., Remove the pizza dough ball from its packaging and place on a lightly floured work surface to rest for 20 minutes while you make the basil oil., To the barrel of a mini food processor or chef prep, add the loose basil leaves, olive oil, and a small garlic clove and process until smooth. Taste for the need for salt and pepper and add if necessary. Process again to combine. Transfer to a pretty serving bowl with spoon or a creamer., Preheat oven to 450°F with rack in upper third position. Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal and set aside. Use a bench scraper or long sharp knife to cut the now rested dough in half to equal two portions. Flatten and press and roll and stretch one piece at a time to a large oblong about 1/4-inch thick and around the size of a small dinner plate and transfer to the prepared baking sheet., Sprinkle doughs evenly with shredded smoked mozzarella, the finely planed pecorino, and some mushroom slices, leaving a small round-ish well in the middle of each and a 1/2-inch border for the crust. The idea behind the well is that this is where the egg will reside, so make the well wider than deep and abstract if round does not conform. Sprinkle pizzas with salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste. Bake in preheated oven until crusts are puffed and starting to brown, 7 to 8 minutes., Remove pizzas from oven. Using the back of a spoon, enhance the well in center of each pizza by gently pressing down. Take each egg and guide it into a dough well while shimmying the yolks to rest in the center. NOTE if your well is not wide enough, the whites may run over the sides of the pizza, and while this is okay, ideally, you want it to stay confined to the well., Carefully return pizzas to oven and bake at 450°F until egg whites are set but yolks are still runny, 5 to 7 minutes. A good way to tell if your whites are set is to jiggle the baking sheet. If the whites are set, you should see little to no jiggling. NOTE if you plan to enjoy this as a handheld, consider the doneness of the yolk and bake until only slightly runny., Use a large, wide metal spatula to remove each pizza to a plate.

If you have a pizza stone add the pizza stone to the oven while preheating so it can get hot. Don’t have a pizza stone? That is okay I recommend using a sheet pan if that is the case!, Start by prepping the seasoning, cheese, and pepperoni. To make the Italian seasoning simply mix together the salt, oregano, and basil in a small bowl. Set aside until needed., Shred the cheese, if you are having trouble grating it, it pulls apart into small chunks really easily (like string cheese) so it can be used that way. You can also prepare the string cheese, unwrap 7 of the cheeses (with 2 more ready if needed), one of the string cheeses needs to be cut in half to make 2 short pieces., Prepare the heart pepperoni. If you happen to have a heart cookie cutter that is the correct size or close to the correct size use that! Otherwise you have 2 other options. First, stack about 6 pepperoni at a time, carefully using a sharp knife to cut a heart shape. Second, fold a pepperoni in half and cut a half heart shape to make a nice heart with a kitchen scissors. Don’t stress if they don’t look absolutely perfect, the oven shrinks the pepperoni hiding some of the imperfections., Carefully roll out your crust into a large circle, the bigger the better but make sure the crust doesn’t get too thin, this pizza is heavy so it needs support. Since this pizza is being stuffed an absolute perfect circle doesn’t matter, heck if it is a little triangle shaped that is good!, Now prepare the work surface with a sprinkle of cornmeal. You will need to transfer the prepared pizza to the hot stone so a pizza paddle or an inverted sheet pan work best, get plenty of cornmeal underneath the dough so it can easily slide. If you don’t have a pizza stone you can prepare the pizza right on the sheet pan you are planning on baking it on, so just a little sprinkle of cornmeal is necessary so keep it from sticking when done., Transfer the dough to the center of the prep area. Grab 4 of your string cheese sticks to make a ‘V’ starting at the bottom of the dough leaving just enough room at the bottom to pull the dough over the end of the ‘V’, if your crust is large enough add 2 more to the sides for a larger pizza. Grab the 2 remaining whole string cheeses and make the top ‘V’. Now take the two halves that are left and connect the top ‘V’ and bottom ‘V’ on each side. Now you should have a heart shape!, To start the ‘stuffing’ the crust you want to start at the top of the heart since it is the trickiest spot. Using a pizza cutter (or kitchen scissors) carefully cut from the center top down to about 1 inch above the top ‘V’. Now to stuff this area of the pizza you will grab the top piece of the section you just cut and pull it up and then down onto the whole string cheese on that side of the small ‘V’, do the same for the other side. Next carefully pull the outside dough up and over the rest of the string cheese heart. To make sure that the cheese doesn’t leak out use your fingers to press the dough together, looking for any holes to cover with dough if needed., Brush the olive oil onto the stuffed crust., Add the tomatoes to the inside of the pizza dough, spreading evenly. Now sprinkle the Italian seasoning mixture on the olive oil and tomato sauce., Add cheese to the pizza, if you don’t use all of the cheese that is okay use just enough to cover the pizza. Add your heart pepperoni to on top of the cheese., If you are keeping your pizza on the sheet pan transfer to the oven. Otherwise very carefully remove the hot stone from the oven. Top the stone with a little sprinkle of cornmeal. Carefully transfer the prepared pizza to the stone.

Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you don’t have a stand mixer, simply use a large mixing bowl and mix the dough with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in the next step., Add the olive oil, salt, and flour. Beat on low speed for 3 minutes. It will be slightly tacky to the touch., Knead the dough:, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5-8 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5-8 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil or nonstick spray—just use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 2 hours or until double in size. (Tip: For the warm environment on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150°F (66°C). Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When it’s doubled in size, remove from the oven.), Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C). Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you shape the pizza. (If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.) Lightly grease baking sheet or pizza pan with nonstick spray or olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor., Shape the dough, When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. (If not making 2 pizzas, freeze half of the dough for another time—see freezing instructions below.) On a lightly floured work surface using lightly floured hands or rolling pin, gently flatten the dough into a disc. Place on prepared pan and, using lightly floured hands, stretch and flatten the disc into a 12-inch circle. Lift the edge of the dough up to create a lip around the edges. I simply pinch the edges up to create the rim. If using a pizza stone, place the dough directly on baker’s peels dusted with cornmeal., Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for a few minutes as you prepare your pizza toppings., Top & bake the pizza, To prevent the filling from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the top lightly with olive oil. Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Top with your favorite toppings and bake for 15-16 minutes., Slice hot pizza and serve immediately.

The dough should start to form and pull away from the sides of the bowl. Knead in the mixer on low speed for 5 mins. The dough should be soft and no longer sticky when it's done., Remove the bowl from the stand mixer, lift your ball of dough out of the bowl and add a teaspoon of olive oil to the mixing bowl. Put the dough back into the bowl, roll it into the oil so the surface is covered, cover the bowl and allow it to rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours. I usually let it rise for 1 1/2 hours., Once the dough has risen, weigh it with a kitchen scale and divide it into two equal sections. You can estimate it if you don't have a kitchen scale. My two dough sections were about 1lb each. You're going to work one section of dough at a time, so keep the one you're not working on covered so it doesn't dry out., On a very lightly floured surface, roll out the first section of dough. I rolled it out and shaped it into a heart by hand. I found it helpful to cut a heart template out of parchment paper and use that as a guide to make the heart. Mine was about 12 inches across and 12 inches tall. I also would gently fold the heart in half down the middle from time to time, to ensure that it was symmetrical. Once you're happy with the first heart, lay it on a piece of parchment paper and cover it so that you can make the second heart., Once both dough hearts are ready, measure out your toppings. I chose to do half pesto, half pizza sauce and then top with mozzarella. You can add in anything you want! I would try and keep the toppings small if you wanted to add anything like pepperoni or olives, etc., I would probably chop them up to make it easier for when you go to slice the heart into strips. Place a piece of parchment paper under your bottom dough heart before you start to top it. This will make it easier to move from your cutting surface to your sheet pan for baking. You want to avoid cutting on your sheet pan because it will ruin the surface., Add your choice of sauce in a thin, even layer. Cutting and twisting can get messy if there is too much in between the layers of dough., Add cheese and if you're adding additional toppings, add them too!, Carefully lay the top heart dough on top of your bottom layer and your pizza fillings. Then place a cookie cutter or something similar in the middle as a guide so that you can start making your slices. The cutter that I used is linked below. It is about 2 1/2 inches across and 2 3/4 inches tall., Using a sharp knife, start at the bottom and make your first slice. I cut from the bottom of the heart cookie cutter to the bottom point of my heart. I then worked my way from the bottom to the top of the right side, making cuts evenly spaced from each other, all the way around. Each one was about an inch wide at the end. I had 10 strips total. Once the right side is complete, repeat on the left side. It doesn't have to be perfect, so don't worry too much, just trust the process!, Starting with the bottom right strip, carefully lift it and twist it 2 full turns. Then do the same with the bottom left strip, but in the opposite direction. You want to twist all of the strips on the right in the same direction (I twisted them counter-clockwise) and all of the strips on the left will twist in the opposite direction (I twisted my left side clockwise). Working from the bottom to the top, twist up one side and then the other., Leave the cookie cutter in place and lightly cover your heart to let it rise a second time for about 30 mins. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and place a rack in the center., Once the second rise is done, lightly brush the entire surface with the olive oil and seasoning mixture, using a pastry brush., This will need to bake on a full sheet sized rimmed baking sheet (25 inches x 17 1/4 inches) because it expands a lot while baking. In the photo above, mine is on a half sheet. I moved it to my full sheet before putting it into the oven because I expected that it would expand quite a bit and it did. Using the parchment paper beneath, carefully lift and place your pizza twists onto the baking sheet and place into the oven. Bake for 28 minutes.

Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and place somewhere warm. I like to put it in the oven with the oven light on, but if you’re someplace warm or with a sunny window, that will work too. Let the dough rise for about 20-30 minutes, no need to be super exact., Knead dough for a few seconds, Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough around 4-6 times until it’s a smooth dough, about 10-15 seconds., Pizza time, It’s ready!

Pour about a teaspoon of olive oil on top the garlic cloves, cover with foil and roast in a baking dish for 45 minutes, or until golden brown and soft. Allow to cool and then squeeze garlic out of the paper skin into a small bowl, set aside., While the garlic is roasting, heat a large skillet over medium heat, add the butter and melt.

After the pizza has been cooking for 10-15 (10 if you like it doughy, 15 if you like it more crispy) minutes remove from the oven and spread the kale over the pizza. Then pop the pizza back in the oven for another 15 minutes or until the kale is crispy. I would start checking the pizzas around 5 minutes in and turning the pan if needed. The dough will sizzle a little since it’s on olive oil., Once the pizza is done remove from the oven and allow to sit five minutes.

If you do not have a pizza peel you can use a wooden cutting board OR you can assemble and bake on THE BACK of a cookie sheet., Divide the dough in half (well-floured hands help) and stretch it carefully into a circle. I like a thinner crust so I just leave a slight lip around the edge of my circle and I stretch it pretty thin but this is all about preference (Note: thicker dough will take a little longer to cook)., Place your circle on the peel/cutting board/cookie sheet you set up and add your toppings., If you are using the cookie sheet, place it right in the oven (middle rack) and bake for 10 minutes., If you heated a pizza stone in the oven, carefully slide your pizza off the peel or cutting board and onto the stone.

You can see photos of how the dough looks through the process in the recipe notes above., Now, tip the dough out onto the counter and knead it really well using your hands. This is a lovely dough to work with and with the right kneading, it will become soft and silky. I find it takes around 10 minutes to come together when kneading by hand.Note - you can do this using a stand mixer - you can see the instructions for how to do this here., Once the dough is silky and elastic, pop it into a warm bowl (I warm a bowl with water and then dry it - this speeds up the rising).Cover with cling wrap or a damp tea towel and leave to rise until it has doubled. See notes below for timing and how to judge it., Once the dough has doubled, separate the dough into smaller balls so they are ready to be rolled out. I use 200g per pizza (this fits my pizza oven perfectly) but anywhere from 200g to 300g is good for a pizza.Leave the balls on your counter top, covered with a tea towel, for around 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax., Once you're ready to make your bases, use your fingers to press your dough into a pizza round. If you need to stretch the dough, pick it up and move your hands around the edges, allowing the dough's own weight to stretch it out into a round. Avoid using a rolling pin if you can to maintain your dough's sourdough character and give it good structure when baked., Place your pizza dough onto pizza peels ready to top with your favorite toppings (see my notes in the article above for my best tips on using pizza peels).When you are ready to bake, pre heat your oven to 230C/450F and make sure it's HOT!!

Stir with a spoon to combine. Add the oil and water and stir until the dough comes together into a shaggy mass. Fit the stand mixer with the dough hook and knead on medium-low speed until the dough is smooth and elastic, 5 to 7 minutes. (Alternatively, you can knead the dough by hand.) The dough should be slightly tacky and cling just to the bottom of the bowl; if it seems too dry during the kneading process, add 1 tablespoon of water. If it seems too sticky, add 1 tablespoon of flour., Dust your hands with flour, then gather the dough into a ball and transfer it to a lightly oiled large bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours., When the dough has risen, punch it down and place on a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough in half and roll each piece into a ball., If you’re not using the dough right away, lightly coat the dough balls with olive oil. Place into freezer bags and seal shut, squeezing out all the air. Refrigerate for up to 2 days. When ready to use, let the dough sit out on the countertop for 30 minutes to warm up before stretching. The dough can also be frozen for up to 3 months. When ready to use, defrost in the refrigerator overnight (or for at least 12 hours), and then let it warm up on the countertop for about 30 minutes before stretching and proceeding with your pizza recipe., If you're planning to use the dough right away, cover the dough balls with a damp kitchen towel and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes (the dough will rise a bit). Using your hands, stretch the dough to the desired shape. Proceed with your pizza recipe, or follow the general baking instructions below., General Baking Instructions: Preheat the oven to 500°F and set an oven rack in the bottom position. Dust a 13x18-inch baking sheet lightly with cornmeal. Place the stretched dough on the baking sheet, and gently stretch it out again so that it maintains its shape. Spread your sauce over the dough, leaving a ½-inch border around the edges. Slide the baking sheet into the oven and bake for 5 to 7 minutes, until the crust is partially cooked. Remove from the oven and scatter the cheese and toppings over the sauce. Slide the pan back into the oven and cook until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbling, 4 to 6 minutes more. Remove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Slice and serve., Note: Active dry yeast may be used instead of instant yeast, however the dough will take longer to rise. To give active dry yeast a boost, you can dissolve it in the warm water and let it sit until frothy, about 10 minutes. Following that, add it to the mixing bowl with the flour, oil, and salt and proceed with the recipe., Note: The water should be warm to the touch — not hot — as anything over 130°F will kill the yeast and keep the dough from rising.

Continue kneading for 8 minutes until the dough feels pillowy and has a smooth, stretchy exterior. If the dough is very sticky, add a small amount of flour while kneading. Alternatively: attach the dough hook to a stand mixer and start the mixer on medium-low speed, then allow the mixer to knead for 8 minutes., After the kneading is finished, divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Using floured hands, gently shape each half into a boule (ball shape) by folding the dough under itself. Set each boule on a floured surface and dab the dough with a bit of olive oil to keep it moist. Cover all boules with a damp towel and allow them to rise until doubled in size, about 45 minutes to 1 hour., The dough can be used immediately. However for the BEST flavor, transfer the dough to separate sealed containers, large enough for the dough to double in size again, and store in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days. (We always do this. But if you think ahead, it makes for a noticeably nutty, unique flavor that truly is the best homemade pizza dough you’ve ever had!) You can also freeze pizza dough you don’t plan to use the day of., **If you're using the dough after refrigerating:, The day of serving, remove the dough from the containers, place it on a lightly floured surface covered with a towel, and allow it to come to room temperature before stretching, 30 to 45 minutes., When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!), Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough or follow these instructions: To stretch the dough, place it on the pizza peel or a lightly floured surface and gently press it into a circle, flipping several times and adding a pinch of flour if it is too sticky. Once you have about an 8-inch circle, pick up the dough and gently drape it over the knuckles on both of your hands. Slowly rotate it around, allowing gravity to stretch it into a circle about 11 inches in diameter. Do not overwork or fold the dough. If the dough starts to resist stretching, put it down and allow it to rest for a few minutes, at which point it will stretch more easily., We bake our pizzas at 500F and use a pizza peel to transfer it to a preheated pizza stone in the oven: the bake time is around 5 to 7 minutes.

Bread flour is a good 2nd choice. All-purpose flour works fine, too, if that's what you have on hand. Monica's favorite is a 50-50 mix of ""00"" and all-purpose flour., TO MIX DOUGH: Add flour, yeast, and salt to a 3 quart (or larger) bowl and whisk to combine. Stir in water and oil and combine until uniformly moist with no dry flour remaining. The dough should be fairly wet and sticky (but not soupy); if it's dry, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time., Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Leave on counter at room temperature for 4 to 12 hours (8 or more hours is best, if you have time). Dough will bubble and expand. It's fine if it begins to collapse. No need to stir or punch it down--just leave it alone., Move covered bowl to refrigerator for a minimum of 3 hours and up to 5 days before using dough. If possible, refrigerating it at least overnight will improve the flavor and texture, 2 or 3 days is even better. It can be refrigerated as long as 5 days. Also may be divided into smaller portions, wrapped, and frozen at this point for up to 1 month., 1 batch of dough is enough for 8 individual pizzas, 4 medium pizzas, or 2 large pizzas., TO USE DOUGH: Remove from refrigerator 1-2 hours before use. Use a knife or your fingers to cut & pull off the amount of dough you want to use. With floured hands, stretch the dough and tuck the edges under to form a ball; place on floured surface, lightly dust tops with flour, cover with plastic wrap or dish towel, and allow to rest for 1-2 hours., PRE-HEAT BAKING STONE.

If using a metal sheet pan, it doesn't need to be preheated., After resting dough for 1-2 hours, lay dough ball on flat, floured surface; press and stretch it until it is desired size, approx. 1/4 to 1/8 "" thick. If dough is too elastic (it springs back when you try to roll or stretch it), cover it and let it rest for another 10-15 minutes before trying to stretch and shape it again. Don't worry about dough being a perfect circle; an uneven shape is easier and has an appealing rustic appearance., FOR BAKING STONE: Form dough on top of a piece of parchment paper cut to fit on stone (pizza may be baked on top of the paper), add toppings, and use a a pizza peel to transfer to oven. Bake in preheated 525 degree oven for 8-10 minutes., FOR METAL SHEET PAN: Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Do not form dough on parchment paper.

Simply mix the water, olive oil and buttermilk together; mix the yeast, sugar, flour and salt together; then combine wet and dry ingredients until mixed.), Whisk in olive oil and buttermilk (or yogurt). Sprinkle flour and salt over top. Mix until combined. Dough will be really wet and sticky. Cover bowl with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap and place in a warm spot. (Note: To create a warm spot, turn your oven on for 1 minute, then shut it off — it will be barely warm. You should be able to touch your hands to the grates without them burning you, but be careful while you test them out.), Let rise until doubled, 1 to 2 hours. Forty-five minutes before baking, place Steel in oven and preheat oven to 550ºF. Note: If your dough is in the oven rising, be sure to remove it. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and turn dough to coat. Divide dough into 4 equal sections. Dough will be sticky, so just try to handle it minimally using as much flour as needed to keep it from sticking to your hands and your work surface. Shape each section into a ball and let rest for at least 20 minutes before shaping but up to an hour if necessary., To shape the dough, you can use two approaches, and if you are up for experimenting, it's interesting to see how the different approaches produce different results., Use a rolling pin to roll dough into an oval about 8 inches long, then transfer dough to a parchment paper-lined peel. Wet your fingers and lightly rub surface of dough with water. You can fit two of these ovals at a time on the Steel., Use your hands to gently stretch the dough, either in the air gently pulling the edges to stretch it evenly or along your board using all of your fingers to elongate it. Transfer dough to a parchment paper-lined peel. Again, you can fit two of these ovals at a time on the Steel. Wet your fingers and lightly rub surface of dough with water. My thoughts: I prefer not using a rolling pin. When I stretch the dough gently, I find I get nicer air pockets in the finished dough and that the naan itself remains more pliable after it has baked. When I use the rolling pin, the finished naan is stiffer, more like flatbread — still tasty, but not my preference as far as texture goes. The key I have found when using your hands versus is a rolling pin is to be sure to stretch the naan out as well as possible — if you don't get good length, parts of the naan will be really thick and doughy — again, delicious, but not the ideal texture for naan., Shimmy naan onto Baking Steel.

Add the flour and salt. Mix to combine, finishing by hand if necessary to form a rough dough. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes., Stretch and fold, After 30 minutes, grab a corner of the dough and pull it up and into the center. Repeat until you’ve performed this series of folds 4 to 5 times with the dough. Let dough rest for another 30 minutes and repeat the stretching and folding action. If you have the time: do this twice more for a total of 4 times in 2 hours. Note: Even if you can only perform one series of stretches and folds, your dough will benefit. So don’t worry if you have to run off shortly after you mix the dough., Bulk Fermentation (first rise), Cover the bowl with a towel and let rise at room temperature, about 8 to 10 hours at 70°F (21°C) or even less if you live in a warm environment. The dough is ready when it has increased by 50% in volume, has a few bubbles on the surface, and jiggles when you move the bowl from side to side. (UPDATE: In the past I have recommended letting the dough rise until it doubles in volume. If you’ve had success with this, continue to let the dough double. Recently, I have been stopping the bulk fermentation when the dough increases by 50% in volume, and I feel I am actually getting better oven spring in the end.) (Note regarding timing: If you are using 100 g of starter, the bulk fermentation may take less than 8 to 10 hours. If you live in a warm, humid environment, the bulk fermentation may take even less time. In the late spring/early summer, for example, my kitchen is 78ºF and the bulk fermentation takes 6 hours. It is best to rely on visual cues (increase in volume by roughly 50%) as opposed to time to determine when the bulk fermentation is done. A straight-sided vessel makes monitoring the bulk fermentation especially easy because it allows you to see when your dough has truly increased in volume by 50%.), Shape (See notes above), Coax the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Gently shape it into a round: fold the top down to the center, turn the dough, fold the top down to the center, turn the dough; repeat until you’ve come full circle. If you have a bench scraper, use it to push and pull the dough to create tension., Rest, Let the dough rest seam side up rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, line an 8-inch (20-cm) bowl or proofing basket with a towel (flour sack towels are ideal) and dust with flour (preferably rice flour, which doesn’t burn the way all-purpose flour does). Using a bench scraper or your hands, shape it again as described in step 4. Place the round into your lined bowl, seam side up., Proof (second rise), Cover the dough and refrigerate for 1 hour or for as long as 48 hours. (Note: I prefer to let this dough proof for at least 24 hours prior to baking. See video for the difference in the crumb of a loaf that has proofed for 6 hours vs one that has proofed for 24 hours. If you choose to proof the dough in the fridge for an extended period of time, you may want to tuck it into a loosely tied bag — produce bags from the grocery store are great for this purpose — to ensure the dough does not dry out. The original recipe calls for a 1-hour rise, and if you have had success doing that, by all means, keep doing it.), Place a Dutch oven in your oven, and preheat your oven to 550°F (290°C). Cut a piece of parchment to fit the size of your baking pot., Score, Place the parchment over the dough and invert the bowl to release. Using the tip of a small knife or a razor blade, score the dough however you wish — a simple “X” is nice. Use the parchment to carefully transfer the dough into the preheated baking pot., Bake, Lower the oven to temperature to 450ºF (230ºC). Carefully cover the pot. Bake the dough for 30 minutes, covered. Remove the lid, lower the temperature to 400ºF (200ºC) and continue to bake for 10 – 15 minutes more. If necessary, lift the loaf out of the pot, and bake directly on the oven rack for the last 5 to 10 minutes.

Loosely cover and allow to sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy and frothy on top. *If you do not own a stand mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/silicone spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula is a better choice.*, Add the flour, olive oil, and salt (and garlic/seasoning if using). Mix on low speed with the dough hook attachment until combined, about 2 minutes. The dough should be thick, yet soft and slightly sticky. It should pull away from the sides of the bowl as it mixes. When it does, it is ready to knead. If, however, the dough is too sticky to handle, mix in more flour, 1 Tablespoon at a time. Make sure you do not add too much extra flour; you want a soft, slightly tacky dough., Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if using the paddle) and beat for an additional 6-8 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 6-8 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., Place the dough in a greased bowl (I use nonstick spray to grease) and cover with plastic wrap, aluminum foil, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow to sit and rest for 45 minutes at room temperature. Once it has rested and slightly risen, you can continue with the recipe or place the covered dough in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. More instructions in the make ahead Note below., As the dough is resting and rising, prepare your toppings. See blog post and/or recipe note below., Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C)., Shape the dough, Punch the dough down to release any air. Divide the dough in half. On a lightly floured surface with floured hands and working with one dough piece at a time, begin shaping and stretching the dough until it is 1/4 inch thick. You can use a floured rolling pin for this too. Don’t worry about the shape of the dough, just make sure it’s pretty thin. Repeat with the second piece of dough. Carefully transfer both pieces of dough to a parchment paper or silicone-mat lined baking sheet, or use a pizza stone. (You can also shape/roll out the doughs directly on a silicone baking mat or a large sheet of parchment if that is easier for you and then just transfer the whole thing to the baking sheet.), Poke your fingers all around the surface of the flatbreads or prick a few holes with a fork. Drizzle or brush each with 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Top each with your favorite toppings., Bake for 15–20 minutes or until the crust and toppings are browned to your liking. Remove from the oven.

You can leave them in the refrigerator at this point up to 24 hours, or package tightly and keep in the freezer up to a month. Just remember to let them relax, once thawed, for the 45-60 minutes.

Add 2 tablespoons of lukewarm water. Allow to sit for about 10 minutes until the yeast mixture is bubbly., Weigh (or measure) your flour and add to the bowl, along with the rest of the lukewarm water, olive oil, and salt. Mix everything together using a wooden spoon until a soft dough forms. Switch to using your hands. Knead dough for about 10 minutes, adding additional flour, if necessary, until the dough is firm. (You can use a stand mixer for this. Mix for 4 to 5 minutes on medium-low speed.) Shape the dough into a ball., Transfer the dough to a large lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap., To make the pizza immediately:, Place the bowl in a warm spot to rise, about 90 minutes if using active dry yeast; about an hour if using instant yeast. To make the pizza later: Place the bowl in a warm spot to rise for 45 minutes. Place the bowl in the refrigerator and allow the dough to rise slowly for 4 hours (and up to 24 hours). The longer rise also helps develop the crust’s flavor. About 2 hours before you want to serve the pizza, remove the dough from the refrigerator., Prepare the sauce and basting oil (if using), In a medium bowl, crush the tomatoes with your hands (or use a food mill.) Add a drizzle of olive oil and season with salt to taste. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil and garlic. Set both aside., Finish the pizza, Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Form the pieces into balls by tucking the edges underneath to the center and then rub your hands around the outside of each piece until you have a nicely shaped ball.

Add in the warm water, stirring until the dough begins to come together. The mixture will be very shaggy & wet. Turn it out on to a lightly floured surface. Knead until the dough comes together in a soft & smooth ball, 2-3 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased mixing bowl. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel & set it in a warm place in your kitchen to rise until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour., Preheat the grill:, Prepare your grill for indirect cooking, creating a zone of direct high heat & a second zone of indirect heat. If using a gas grill, begin preheating at least 15 minutes before grilling. If using charcoal, light the charcoal at least 30 minutes prior to grilling. (To learn more about zone grilling, be sure to check out this post.), Prepare the crust, Using a knife or a bench scraper, divide the dough into 3 equal pieces (each approx. 8-10 ounces). Form each piece of dough into a ball, tucking the edges back into the center of itself until a smooth ball forms. Set aside to proof for 5-10 minutes. Roll the dough balls into 10-inch rounds. Lightly brush one side of the prepared crusts with olive oil. See Recipe Notes, below, for tips for rolling out pizza dough & pizza dough storage., Par-grill the crust:, Working 1 crust at a time, set the crust, oiled side down, on the direct heat side of the grill. Close the lid & grill 2-3 minutes. The side of the dough facing up should be slightly puffy with air bubbles, & the side of the dough on the grill grates should be golden brown with nice grill marks. Remove the dough from the grill. If desired, repeat with the remaining prepared crusts. It’s helpful to wait 2ish minutes between crusts to give the grill grates a chance to heat back up., Assemble the pizza:, Transfer the par-grilled crust to a work station – it’s helpful to assemble the pizza on a pizza peel (or cutting board, or something similar) to transfer to the grill with ease. Lightly brush the ungrilled side of the par-grilled crust with olive oil, then flip the crust such that the grilled side is facing up. Assemble your pizza, placing sauce, cheese, & toppings of choice on the grilled side of the par-grilled crust. I typically do 1/4 cup sauce, 1/2 cup cheese, & 2-3 toppings per pizza. See blog post, above, for tons of toppings ideas! Remember, when it comes to pizza, it’s important not to go overboard with toppings because otherwise the pizza won’t cook properly., Grill the pizza, Working 1 pizza at a time, transfer the pizza, toppings facing up/oiled side facing down, to the direct heat side of the grill. Close the lid & grill 2-3 minutes. Once the bottom of the crust is golden brown with nice grill marks, carefully transfer the pizza to the indirect heat side of the grill to finish cooking. Close the lid & grill 5 minutes, rotating the pizza halfway through, until the cheese is melted & the toppings are warm. Carefully remove from the grill., Serve, Slice the grilled pizza & serve immediately. Enjoy!","[('kosher salt', 1.0, 'cups'), ('warm water', 1.25, 'cups'), ('extra virgin olive oil', 0.25, 'cup')]"

DO NOT SKIP (start with 1 teaspoon and add more between each pizza)), white cheese (Any combination of shredded provolone, mozzarella, white cheddar, or Parmesan), fresh mozzarella (1 ball for 4 pizzas, in addition to shredded cheese), Optional Toppings - bell pepper, onion, tomato, mushroom, zucchini, minced garlic, olives, artichokes, fresh or frozen herbs or greens like spinach, kale, parsley, basil, oregano or rosemary, Pepperoni, cooked sausage or prosciutto, Variations - Pesto or Bbq sauce with leftover or rotisserie chicken","For the Crust, This recipe makes 8 pizzas, which is 2 pizza nights, 4 pizzas each night for my family of 4. Freeze the extra balls of dough immediately after making. Make the dough the morning of, or 1 to 2 days before pizza night. Add flour and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer. In a glass measuring cup, warm 2 cups of water in the microwave for 1 minute. Add the yeast, honey and olive oil to the water and mix with a fork, let sit 5 minutes. Add the liquid into the flour and mix on low speed with the dough hook to form a rugged ball., Knead the dough for 5 minutes using the dough hook on medium-low speed, or by hand on a floured cutting board if you don't have a mixer. If making by hand, lift and turn with your left hand and push down with the heel of your right hand, over and over for 5 minutes. Add flour if the dough is too sticky. A few times, pull and stretch the dough, wrap it around itself, and then tuck it back into a ball., Once you have kneaded the dough, remove it from the mixer, and tuck it into a ball by tucking the ends under itself to look like a mushroom top. Cut the dough in half with a knife, then in quarters, then in 8 equal pieces., Take each piece and form again into the little mushroom ball. Oil a large bowl, and a container with a lid for the freezer and set 4 dough balls in each. Choose containers that are larger than the dough is now, it will expand to be bigger in size. Adjust these amounts for your family size. These are thin and not very large pizzas, a hungry adult would eat 1 pizza or more and a hungry kid maybe a half. Freeze whatever amount you don't plan to use. For a family of 4, this is 2 nights worth of pizza dough., Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, or reuse an old bread bag to be eco-friendly. Leave it on the counter if pizza night is tonight, or set it in your fridge overnight and pull out the morning of pizza night. Frozen dough can be thawed in the fridge overnight. On the morning of pizza night, take the dough out of the fridge and let it sit on the counter all day., For the Sauce, I don't recommend making homemade sauce on pizza night, see the above sauce section for easy pasta sauce/pizza sauce recipes and variations., To make this homemade sauce recipe, in a large saucepan over medium heat, add oil, onion and any extra hidden veggies from the food processor. Saute until starting to brown and soften., Add garlic, salt, pepper, and seasoning., Add canned tomato. Reduce heat to low and simmer at least 1 hour. Freeze extra sauce in pint size jars (1 jar, about 2 cups, is the right amount of sauce for 4 pizzas). Only fill jars ¾'s full so they don't crack when freezing, cool in the refrigerator before freezing., Making the Pizza, Place a large baking sheet or pizza stone on the bottom rack of your oven and preheat to 450° convection bake., On a cutting board, prepare and slice all toppings, including veggies, cheese and pepperoni., Prepare a pizza peel or another cutting board with a generous sprinkling of cornmeal (start with 1 teaspoon and add more between pizzas)., On another floured cutting board, roll out the first ball of dough with a rolling pin (don't worry that they have expanded and grown together, just pull or cut back apart). Add flour as needed. Get it as thin as you can, about the size of the pizza peel. You can pick it up and lightly stretch it over the backs of your hands, but try not to get a hole in the dough., Transfer dough to the cornmeal covered peel. Top with sauce, cheese and toppings., Making sure the pizza slides around on the cornmeal, transfer the pizza to the hot pan in the oven. You can take the pan out and set it on the stovetop if that is easier. If any part sticks, carefully release it with a spatula and add more cormeal., When pizza #1 is in the oven, make pizza #2. When pizza #2 is ready to go into the oven, pizza #1 probably won't be quite done, but the crust will be firm enough to transfer to the top oven rack. With two sturdy metal spatulas, carefully pick the whole pizza up and put it directly on the oven rack above. You can also do this with an additional cutting board or pizza peel. This pizza will finish cooking, giving you a nice crispy crust. Now your pan is free to slide in pizza #2., While those two are cooking, make pizza #3. By the time you are ready to add #3, pizza #1 is probably done. Remember your oven is really hot, so check on it and don't let it burn. Take it out, slice and serve on a cutting board. Now transfer pizza #2 to the top oven rack and pizza #3 to the sheet pan. Make pizza #4 and transfer them all through the oven using this same method., You did it! And it all gets easier with practice!

We have found that ripe, red jalapeños work better than cayenne (the seed to flesh ratio of cayennes is too high and you end up with a hot sauce that is slightly bitter because of the seeds), but another hot pepper of your choice will work!, Next, prepare a fire for roasting. We used our outdoor pizza oven and a live fire to roast the peppers, but you could also do this on a grill or over an open fire. Roast the peppers until blackened and peeling., Remove the stems of the peppers, and if desired, chop into 2-3 pieces. At this point, you could also remove some of the seeds to reduce spiciness (and a bit of bitter flavor), but it’s not necessary., Prepare a salt brine for the fermentation process. The lacto-fermentation process uses a salt brine to encourage the development of desired bacteria (Lactobacillus, predominantly) that convert lactose and other sugars into lactic-acid, a natural food preservative., The salt brine is the same one used to make naturally fermented pickles or radishes. Because we use our salt brine frequently, I like to batch a gallon batch and keep it at the ready. To make one gallon of brine, simply dissolve 3/4 cup of salt in one gallon of water., Place your fire-roasted jalapeños in a wide-mouthed mason jar (we used a quart sized jar) and cover the peppers completely with your salt brine. At this point, some home fermenters choose to use a glass weight like this one to keep the peppers under the level of the salt brine. You could also use a clean rock. We also chose to add some whole garlic cloves to the ferment at this point, just for a bit of extra flavor., Place your mason jar on a kitchen counter where you can keep an eye on your ferment. Every day or so, check to make sure your peppers are still under the level of the salt brine to prevent mold growth. If they are not, you may need to push them back under the brine, or adjust your weight., Allow your fire-roasted jalapeños to ferment for a week or two. You will begin to see small bubbles forming – this is a good thing!. You can also taste a pepper and see if it has developed a nice tangy flavor. We have kept this batch of lacto-fermented hot sauce fermenting on our kitchen counter for several weeks., At this point, you can either move the entire jar into cold storage (a root cellar, basement, or fridge works well), or you can blend your peppers into a liquid hot sauce. We tend to make a LOT of lacto-fermented hot sauce, so we move the jar of fermented peppers into cold storage in our root cellar, blending new batches of sauce as we need them.","[('hot peppers', None, None), ('salt', 0.75, 'cups'), ('water', 1.0, 'gallon'), ('garlic cloves', 3.0, None)]"

Cover gently with plastic wrap or foil and let them cool until they are easy to handle, about 20 minutes., Put a wide-mouthed canning funnel into a large jar, drop the slices of garlic into the jar and set it near your work station on the counter. Slough the blistered, blackened skin off of each pepper slice, then slide the slice into the jar via the funnel. Repeat until you've done all of the pepper slices. Don't cram the peppers in, they will compact themselves sufficiently and you want to leave room for the oil to circulate., Heat some olive oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat until it registers 200°F on an instant read thermometer. Ladle the olive oil into the canning funnel until the peppers are completely submerged. Use a long chopstick or skewer to slide down the sides of the jar to release air bubbles. Add more oil to keep the peppers covered if necessary. Add a new two-piece lid to the jar and let cool for about an hour before sticking into the refrigerator., These peppers will keep for 3 months as long as they are properly refrigerated.

You can use either frozen or fresh udon, or any noodles you have on hand, but you’ll love slurping up those chewy Japanese noodles in this velvety miso-based sauce. Boil water and cook them according to the package instructions, making sure to save a couple of tablespoons (30 to 60 ml) of the noodle water., Instead of draining the noodles, use tongs or chopsticks to pull them out of the water and directly into your serving bowl, which will save you from needing to use a colander while also warming up your bowl and keeping a bit of residual starchy noodle water with the noodles., Cook the mushrooms while the noodles are boiling. I love having frozen mushooms in my freezer since they’re always frozen at their peak freshness, but you can use fresh mushrooms (like cremini or wild mushrooms) or even dried, rehydrated shiitake mushrooms to add the “meaty” component to this dish.

Don’t worry about any excess liquid that develops in the pan—this will add extra mushroom flavor to the sauce!, Prepare the miso-Parmigiano sauce while the mushrooms are cooking. In a small bowl, beat the large egg with the grated Parmigiano Reggiano, miso paste, doubanjiang, if using, and combine with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the hot noodle water in a small bowl. This will thin out the miso paste and make it easier to combine in the sauce., Add the udon to the cooked mushrooms, tossing to coat the noodles in the residual mushroom oil and water., Turn off the heat, pour the egg mixture onto the noodles and quickly use tongs or chopsticks to stir the sauce into the noodles while shaking the pan around; this “agitation” process will allow the egg mixture to cook into a velvety sauce instead of scrambled eggs.

If you feel comfortable, you can toss the noodles in the pan to do the agitation process instead of using tongs or chopsticks., Plate your noodles by transferring them to your serving bowl.
