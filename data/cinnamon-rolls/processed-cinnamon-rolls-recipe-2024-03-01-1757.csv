These are called the best cinnamon rolls for a reason, and that requires following the recipe as instructed. Here’s what you’ll need to make the best cinnamon rolls: Milk: I recommend 2% or whole milk, but know that almond milk will also work (I’ve tried it!) See my tips below for ensuring your milk is at the right temperature. Granulated sugar: this is used to sweeten the cinnamon rolls and to help activate the yeast. Quick rise yeast: use quick rise or instant yeast in this recipe to help the cinnamon rolls rise faster. You can also use active dry yeast, but the cinnamon rolls may take slightly longer to rise. Scroll down to get tips for using yeast in this recipe! Butter: the one and only. I prefer to use salted butter but unsalted is great too. You’ll need it for the dough, filling and icing. Egg + egg yolk: this recipe calls for 1 egg and 1 egg yolk for the perfect texture and rich consistency in the dough. Bread flour: to help keep these cinnamon rolls soft and fluffy, we’re using bread flour , which has a higher protein level to help lighten the cinnamon roll texture. The higher amounts of protein help to produce more gluten, which gives cinnamon roll the chewy, soft texture you know and love. Brown sugar: personally, I love using dark brown sugar for more robust molasses sweet flavor in those cinnamon swirls, but light brown sugar will work! Cinnamon: YUM. Salt: cinnamon rolls made without salt tastes very plain and in addition, salt also helps to control yeast in cinnamon roll recipes so don’t skip it. For the icing: the icing is truly unforgettable too! Just cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar and vanilla . YES PLEASE. Cinnabon, you’ve got nothing on these rolls. Can I make them dairy free? Yes! As I mentioned, I’ve used almond milk in this cinnamon roll recipe with success. You can also use vegan butter and a vegan cream cheese to make the recipe completely dairy free.  Which yeast is best for cinnamon rolls + how to know when yeast is activated I can understand why it may be confusing to know if your yeast is activated. First, it’s important to know that there are two types of yeast to choose from: Active dry yeast: this type of yeast must be dissolved in liquid, or also what’s known as being “proofed” before it’s added to the rest of the dough ingredients. You’ll know this type of yeast is activated when little bubbles start to appear in the liquid that you dissolve the yeast in (for this recipe it’s warm milk). Instant yeast: also known as quick rise yeast (this is the brand I use and love!) and what we are using for this cinnamon roll recipe. It can be added to the dough without any ‘proofing’ required, so you don’t need to sit and watch the yeast to make sure it bubbles. However, I still like to dissolve it in a little bit of milk and sugar to help get it started. Regardless of which yeast you’re using, it’s essential that you add it to warm milk that’s between 105 and 115 degrees F. More on this below! You can also add a little sugar with either yeast to help it get activated. Tips for making the best cinnamon rolls Don’t overheat your milk. It should be between 105-115 degrees F. Anything hotter is likely to kill the yeast, which means the cinnamon rolls will not rise. A simple tip is to dip your finger in the milk — it should feel warm similar to warm bath water but not HOT. If you warmed it up too much, simply wait a few minutes until it cools down enough to touch. Make sure to use room temperature butter for the filling: a lot of recipes call for using melted butter in the filling, but that will cause the filling to leak out before baking. Room temperature butter is best! Rub the brown sugar into the butter: after you spread out the softened butter, it’s important to rub the brown sugar into the butter and dough so that it’s well combined. Please refer to the video! Use a room temperature egg in the dough: if you use a cold egg, there’s a chance it could affect the yeast or mix with the melted butter and cause it to coagulate. To bring your eggs to room temperature simply place them in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes. Use bread flour: bread flour is available at most grocery stores and it makes ALL the difference in achieving softer, fluffy, perfect cinnamon rolls. JUST TRUST ME. Make sure you flour your work surface and the rolling pin: this is to prevent the cinnamon rolls from sticking to the surface or to the rolling pin.  Tools you’ll need to make cinnamon rolls from scratch Here are some kitchen tools I recommend that will help make this cinnamon roll recipe a success: Stand mixer. You’ll want to use the dough hook on your stand mixer to easily knead the dough before rolling it out. Don’t have a stand mixer? No worries! You can also knead the dough by hand. Wooden spoon. I recommend mixing your dough together with a wooden spoon . Rolling pin. For rolling out that beautiful dough. Pro tip: if you don’t have a rolling pin you can also flour up a wine bottle! Serrated knife. Using a serrated knife will help you cut the cinnamon rolls out after you roll the dough up. You can also use floss. 9×9 inch pan. I recommend using a 9×9 inch baking pan or 9-inch circular pan so that the cinnamon rolls fit well and bake properly.  Storing tips Feel free to store your freshly baked cinnamon rolls covered at room temp for 1-2 days, then transfer them to the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Simply reheat in the microwave to get them soft and gooey again! How to make overnight cinnamon rolls After the first rise, roll the cinnamon rolls up, cut them as directed, arrange them in a pan lined with parchment paper , cover well with plastic wrap then place them in the fridge overnight. When you are ready to bake, bring the cinnamon rolls to room temperature and let them rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour before baking as directed. Please note that in the video I accidentally say to put the cinnamon rolls in the fridge after the 2nd rise, but you should put them in the fridge after the first rise.  How to freeze cinnamon rolls To freeze before baking: the dough should be frozen after the first rise (once they are rolled up with the filling in and cut). Place into a pan and cover well, then place in freezer. When you are ready to bake, let the dough thaw in the fridge — preferably overnight, then put in a warm spot for 30 minutes to 1 hour before baking to activate the second rise. Bake cinnamon rolls as directed. To freeze after baking: allow the cinnamon rolls to come to room temperature after baking, then you can choose to either freeze the entire pan, making sure they are well wrapped or covered in an airtight container, or you can choose to freeze individual cinnamon rolls. When ready to eat, defrost the cinnamon rolls at room temperature, then warm in the oven at 350 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or you can warm them up individually in the microwave for 20-30 seconds (once defrosted). I prefer to freeze them before they are iced, and then frost them when ready to eat. The icing is also freezer-friendly! Your cinnamon roll questions: answered Be sure to read through the full post for answers to common questions about making cinnamon rolls. A few more common questions that I get: Can I use all purpose flour? The recipe will still work with all purpose flour (and readers have used it with success) but I highly recommend sticking with bread flour because, as I mentioned, it’s what makes these cinnamon rolls extra fluffy and delicious. Why did the middles pop out of my cinnamon rolls? This can happen if you roll them a bit too tightly or your pan is too small. Be sure to cut dough off of the ends of your cinnamon roll log as shown in the video below so that the rolls all fit in your pan. Can I double the recipe? Yep! Just remember to use a larger pan. What can I do if my dough is too sticky while kneading? Simply add a little more flour, about a tablespoon at a time, until it’s easier to work with. Can I use a bread maker? I haven’t tested this recipe using a bread maker, but readers in the comments have done so with success! Can I add mix-ins to the filling? You bet! I think chopped nuts, raisins, or even other spices like pumpkin pie spice would be delicious.

Big, fluffy, soft and absolutely delicious. You'll never go back to any other recipe once you try this one! This cinnamon roll recipe includes options to make them overnight or ahead of time and even freeze them. Ingredients For the dough: ¾ cup warm milk (whole milk or 2% preferred) (110 degrees F) 2 ¼ teaspoons quick rise or active yeast (1/4-ounce package yeast)* ¼ cup granulated sugar 1 egg plus 1 egg yolk, at room temperature ¼ cup butter, melted (I prefer salted, but unsalted works, too) 3 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting 3/4 teaspoon salt For the filling: 2/3 cup dark brown sugar (light brown sugar also works) 1 ½ tablespoons ground cinnamon ¼ cup butter, softened For the cream cheese frosting: 4 oz cream cheese, softened 3 tablespoons butter, softened ¾ cup powdered sugar ½ teaspoon vanilla extract Instructions Warm milk to around 110 degrees F. I like to do this by placing milk in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving it for 40-45 seconds. It should be like warm bath water. Transfer warm milk to the bowl of an electric mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Add in sugar, egg, egg yolk and melted butter. Mix until well combined. Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form. Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it's TOO sticky (meaning it's sticking to the bottom of the mixer, add in 2 tablespoons more bread flour.) If you don’t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface. Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour to 1 ½ hours, or until doubled in size. This may more or less time depending the humidity and temperature in your home. After dough has doubled in size, transfer dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a 14x9 inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over dough, leaving a ¼ inch margin at the far side of the dough. In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter. Tightly roll dough up, starting from the 9-inch side and place seam side down making sure to seal the edges of the dough as best you can. You will probably need to cut off about an inch off the ends of the dough as the ends won’t be as full of cinnamon sugar as we’d want it to be. Cut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife or floss. You should get 9 large pieces. Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x9 inch baking pan or round 9 inch cake pan. (I also recommend lining the pan with parchment paper as well, in case any of the filling ends up leaking out.) Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30-45 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. You want to underbake them a little so they stay soft in the middle, that’s why we want them just slightly golden brown. Allow them to cool for 5-10 minutes before frosting. Makes 9 cinnamon rolls. To make the frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth and fluffy. Spread over cinnamon rolls and serve immediately. Enjoy! Recipe Notes *If you use quick rise or instant yeast you do not need to ""proof"" it before adding in the dough ingredients. If you use active dry yeast, you'll want to dissolve it in the warm milk until little bubbles appear before adding the rest of the dough ingredients. The dough may take longer to rise with active dry yeast as well. To make overnight cinnamon rolls: After placing rolls into the greased pan (after the first rise), simply cover, place overnight in the fridge and then bake them in the morning as directed. I like to bring my cinnamon rolls to room temperature first by leaving them on the counter for 30-45 minutes before baking (this is known as the second rise).

6be777fc,https://joyfoodsunshine.com/cinnamon-rolls-recipe/,Best Cinnamon Rolls Recipe (Better than Cinnabon),"This recipe took me years to perfect, and as such I do not recommend making any substitutions. These homemade cinnamon rolls contain only a few, common ingredients that most of us always have on hand! Flour, sugar, butter, eggs, salt, cinnamon, etc. What makes this cinnamon roll recipe stand out among the rest is that there is both vanilla extract and cinnamon in the cinnamon roll dough. These two additions take these cinnamon rolls from good, the best you’ve ever had.  Milk. I recommend using whole milk, but 2% milk works well too. I do not recommend going lower than 2% because the fat content really matters to making rich, moist, and dense cinnamon rolls. All-purpose flour. bread flour may be used in place of all-purpose flour for a little bit lighter texture. I have not tried using any healthier substitutions like whole wheat flour, so I cannot speak to the success in the outcome if you try it. Butter. both salted and unsalted butter work well. Brown sugar. I recommend using light brown sugar in this recipe, however if you love the molasses-y taste of dark brown sugar you can use that in place of some or all of the light brown sugar. Ground Cinnamon. choose a high-quality cinnamon for the best result0. Cream cheese. Full fat or light cream cheese both work well in this recipe. Obviously, the higher the fat content, the richer the taste. Vanilla Extract. I implore you to only ever use pure vanilla extract in your baking! No imitation extracts need apply here!  How to make cinnamon rolls Let’s walk through how to make cinnamon rolls, and don’t forget to watch the video. Begin by making the dough. Make the homemade cinnamon roll dough Start by proofing the yeast until it is foamy.  Then add the rest of the wet ingredients stir until they are just combined.  Combine the dry ingredients then add them to the wet ingredients, then stir to combine. You can do this two ways: 1: Use a standing mixer: I recommend using a standing mixer fitted with the dough hook to make the dough for these best cinnamon rolls. Add a about 1/3 of the dry ingredients at a time, mixing after each addition, to avoid making a mess! 2. Mix the dough by hand: Mixing the dough by hand is also very easy to do. The only difference will be that mixing the dough requires more kneading by hand than using the standing mixer.  Knead the dough Once a firm but slightly tacky dough ball has formed in the standing mixer (as pictured below), turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead by hand, adding more flour if necessary. Knead the dough for 2-5 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic, but still a little sticky.  Let the Cinnamon Roll Dough Rise for the first time Once the dough is smooth and elastic, place it in a lightly greased bowl to rise. I recommend covering it with a warm, damp towel and putting the bowl in a warm place to rise (for about 1 hour). How to make the dough rise faster: To help the dough rise faster, boil some water and put it in a bowl or measuring dish next to the bread that’s rising. Cover the bread and the vessel containing the boiling water with a damp towel. This creates a warm, moist environment that yeast loves. I also recommend putting the dough/boiling water/damp cloth apparatus in your oven with the lights turned on. This creates a warm moist environment, which speeds up the rising process.  Make the Cinnamon Sugar Filling While the homemade cinnamon roll dough is rising, make the cinnamon sugar filling. This is very easy to do, however there are two different methods I would like to discuss… There are two ways to make the cinnamon sugar filling: 1. Combine all ingredients and then spread onto the dough. For this method, add softened butter, brown sugar and cinnamon to a medium-sized bowl and combine with a fork until the mixture in homogenous. Then spread this mixture on the dough with your hands and a greased spatula.  2. Combine dry ingredients, but melt butter and brush it on the dough. For this method, combine the cinnamon and sugar in a bowl and mix well. Then, melt the butter and use a pastry brush to brush it on the rolled out dough. Next, sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture over the melted butter and roll it out.  The second method is easier (in my opinion), because spreading the butter/brown sugar/cinnamon mixture is a little bit difficult. However the first method (mixing all the ingredients together) is my preferred method. I prefer this method because the filling doesn’t leak to the bottom of the pan (and out of the cinnamon rolls) as much it does with method #2. There is virtually no filling leakage when all the ingredients are combined and spread onto the dough, but there is some leakage with the melted butter method. Form the dough into a rectangle After the dough has risen, press it down to release the air from it and form it into a rectangle. This step is important because it makes it easier to roll the dough into the desired shape (which is a large rectangle).  Roll the dough Next, roll the dough into a rectangle that is 24×12” and about 1/4″ thick. This dough is so easy to work with that this step should be very easy. If you find the dough is sticking to the rolling surface, add a light dusting of flour. I use this marble rolling pin in every recipe that requires rolling and I absolutely love it. The weight is perfect to get a nice even roll, especially for yeasted dough.  Add the cinnamon sugar filling Once the dough has been rolled out into the desired shape and size, add the cinnamon sugar filling. As I mentioned above, spreading the filling can be a little tricky, but here are a few tips to make it easier: Start by sprinkling most (but not all) of the filling evenly over the dough. It will look like there isn’t enough, but do not worry there definitely is. Take a greased spatula and spread the filling evenly over the dough. While this cinnamon roll dough is hearty, you still need to be careful not to tear it while you are spreading the filling. Add the rest of the filling where needed, and spread until it’s evenly distributed.  When the filling is evenly spread, it will look like the photo below. Be sure to leave a 1/4″ border around the edges without filling so that it doesn’t leak during baking.  Tightly roll the dough lengthwise It is very important to get a tight roll on the dough. I recommend pulling the dough towards you and gently pressing down as you roll it.  Once you have finished tightly rolling the best cinnamon roll dough, it should look like the photo below. Be sure to pinch together the dough where the end meets the roll, to prevent the filling from leaking.  Cut the dough into 12 pieces Now it’s time to cut these homemade cinnamon rolls into individual pieces. I recommend using a very sharp knife or even a string to cut them, to avoid smushing the rolls and ruining the swirl. Measure before cutting I highly recommend that you do not eyeball the cutting process. Instead, measure the length of the dough roll (which should be 24″ long) and divide it by 12 to determine how long each cinnamon roll should be. Then, use your knife to make marks at the places you will cut (in the case of a 24″ roll that would be every 2 inches). After you have marked out all of your cuts, then use either a knife or string to cut the rolls.  Place rolls into a 9×13″ Baking Dish Arrange the cinnamon rolls into four rows of three in a 9×13″ baking dish. They will rise and touch each other, but this is a good thing , because it makes them extra gooey. I recommend lining the baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the cinnabon cinnamon rolls from sticking to the pan.  Cover the cinnamon rolls and let them rise Once the homemade cinnamon rolls are arranged in the baking sheet, cover them with a warm damp towel and let them rise until doubled in size. Be very careful not to let the towel touch the tops of the cinnamon rolls. During this rise, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F so the oven is ready to go once the dough has risen (which takes between 30 and 60 minutes). After they have risen, they should look like the photo below.  Bake After the rolls have doubled in size, it’s time to put them in that oven and bake. Something important to note is that this cinnamon rolls recipe will rise more in the oven. So do not be surprised if you see the rolls start to puff up even more as they bake. Bake them for 20-25 minutes. You will know the rolls are done when: they are golden brown on top they sound hollow when gently hit with a wooden spoon. the outside of the rolls feel firm (and not doughy) to the touch. A thermometer inserted inside the middle roll reads 185 degrees F.  Make the cream cheese icing In my opinion, there is no other way to top a cinnamon roll than with a delicious, homemade cream cheese frosting. I recommend making the frosting while the cinnamon rolls are baking. Begin by beating together the butter and cream cheese until smooth. You want to ensure there are no lumps. Then add the vanilla and beat until combined.  Next, carefully add the powdered sugar. I recommend adding half at a time and beating the frosting after each addition.  Finally, beat the cream cheese icing until silky smooth. Make sure to fully incorporate the powdered sugar so there are no lumps! Again, you can either use a standing mixer or a hand mixer! Keep the cream cheese frosting at room temperature. The frosting incorporates into this cinnamon rolls recipe the best when it is at room temperature. If you are making the rolls right away, do not refrigerate the frosting. When making in advance: if you are making the recipe the night before to bake in the morning, remove the cream cheese frosting from the refrigerator and place it on the counter to come to room temperature as the cinnamon rolls rise and bake.  Frost the Homemade Cinnamon Rolls Frost the cinnamon rolls as soon as you remove them from the oven. I cannot stress this enough! Adding the cream cheese frosting to the warm cinnamon rolls causes the icing to melt into the cracks of the rolls, is one of the factors that makes them gooey – just like Cinnabon.  Serve warm Finally, it is time to dig in and enjoy these homemade cinnamon rolls! I recommend letting them cool for 10 or so minutes before serving. But eating them warm is definitely the best way to enjoy them!  How to make cinnamon rolls ahead of time: I receive many questions about making these in advance. There are many ways to do this, here are my suggestions below. Always tightly cover the rolls so no air can get to the dough and dry it out.  Refrigerate dough after 1st rise before making rolls. Punch down the dough after the first rise. Place the cinnamon roll dough in a large bowl and tightly cover it with plastic wrap and a tea towel or with a lid and refrigerate overnight. To make the rolls: remove the dough and proceed with the recipe. Keep in mind assembled rolls may take longer to rise if the dough is cold. Refrigerate assembled cinnamon rolls to bake the next day ( preferred ) Tightly wrap the assembled, but not risen, cinnamon rolls with plastic wrap and cover with a damp tea towel or the lid to the baking dish. Refrigerate overnight. In the morning, remove the assembled rolls from the refrigerator. Loosen the plastic wrap and let the cinnamon rolls come to room temperature and complete their second rise covered with loose-fitting plastic wrap and a warm, damp tea towel. Bake risen rolls according to the recipe! Freeze assembled cinnamon rolls to bake at a later date. Tightly wrap the assembled, but not risen, cinnamon rolls with plastic wrap and cover with tin foil or the lid to the baking dish. Place the cinnamon rolls in the freezer for up to 1 month (but I don’t recommend any longer than 1 month). To bake, remove cinnamon rolls and let them come to room temperature overnight and complete their second rise. Bake according to recipe instructions.  Recipe FAQS I want to take a moment and answer many of the questions about this cinnamon roll recipe that I’ve been asked over the years. Can cinnamon roll dough be left to rise overnight? Yes. I often make this recipe the night before a special holiday or event (like Christmas, my daughter’s birthday, etc.) and let them rise overnight. However, it is very important that you put the dough in the refrigerator . Do not leave them at room temperature overnight, because you run the risk of them rising too much and becoming a big doughy mess. How do you store unbaked cinnamon rolls? To store the unbaked cinnamon rolls in the refrigerator, wrap the pan tightly with plastic wrap and cover it with tin foil or a lid. I often use this glass baking dish with a lid , to ensure that the dough doesn’t dry out overnight. Can you refrigerate cinnamon roll dough? Yes! I recommend refrigerating the dough after it has been cut, as discussed above. Can you freeze cinnamon roll dough. Yes. I do this all the time to prepare even farther in advance than the night before. To do this, place the cinnamon roll dough in baking sheet and wrap it as mentioned above (wrap the pan tightly with plastic wrap and cover it with tin foil or a lid). Then place it in the freezer for up to 1 month (but I don’t recommend any longer than 1 month). How do you make icing for cinnamon rolls? Here are a few tips for making the cream cheese icing for this cinnamon roll recipe: Use room temperature ingredients. It is critical that the cream cheese and butter have completely reached room temperature and are softened before trying to combine them. Cold ingredients will be much harder to beat together. Thoroughly beat the cream cheese and butter before adding other ingredients. Do this to ensure there are no lumps in your cream cheese frosting. You can use a standing mixer or a hand mixer. Add vanilla and beat again. After adding vanilla, be sure to beat the mixture again until it’s well combined. What temperature do you bake cinnamon rolls? This homemade cinnamon roll recipe bakes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (which is about 177 degrees Celsius). Please do not try to rush the baking process by increasing the temperature. It is important to the final rising process that these rolls bake at 350 degrees F! How long do you bake homemade cinnamon rolls? Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until: The rolls are golden brown on top. They sound hollow when gently hit with a wooden spoon. The outside of the rolls feel firm (and not doughy) to the touch. A thermometer inserted inside the middle roll reads 185 degrees F. Can you freeze baked and frosted cinnamon rolls? Yes. Flash-freeze the cinnamon rolls on a pan. Once they are frozen, wrap them tightly with plastic wrap and put them in an airtight container in the freezer. To reheat, either leave them at room temperature until they are soft and then microwave for 25-30 seconds, or use the defrosting setting in your microwave to thaw the cinnamon rolls. They can also be warmed in an oven set to 300 degrees! Just be sure to watch them so the frosting doesn’t completely melt! Can you bake cinnamon rolls from frozen? I do not recommend baking these directly from frozen for one very important reason: The dough needs to rise. To bake cinnamon rolls after the dough has been frozen: Remove the frozen cinnamon roll dough from the freezer the night before you would like to bake them. Leave the dough on the counter to come to room temperature and rise until doubled in size. After the dough has risen, bake and frost according to the recipe instructions. How do you make gooey cinnamon rolls? This cinnamon roll recipe makes the absolute best, gooiest cinnamon rolls for the following reasons: The rolls touch each other while baking. After the cinnamon rolls rise they will be touching each other on all sides (except for the part pointing to the outside of the pan). This keeps the centers nice and soft and gooey! The filling doesn’t leak out . Using the method where all the ingredients are mixed together and then spread onto the dough keeps the filling inside the homemade cinnamon rolls where it belongs, which makes them nice and gooey. Frosting while warm. Like I explained above, frosting the cinnamon rolls while they are warm makes them extra gooey and delicious! How do you re-incorporate the filling if it leaks out? Sometimes things happen during the baking process and the filling leaks out. To get it back into the rolls simply cover the pan of warm rolls with a lid or another baking sheet and invert the baking sheet.

It should be warm but not hot to the touch (about 105 degrees F). Place milk into the bowl of your standing mixer, then add 1 TBS sugar and 1 TBS yeast to the warm milk. Stir and let it sit (proof) for five minutes or until it becomes foamy. Add the ½ cup sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla to the mixture in the bowl of your standing mixer. Use a dough hook to stir until combined Add 4 cups flour, salt and cinnamon and stir the dough hook, starting on low and increasing to high. Knead dough in the standing mixer until a large ball is formed. The dough should be smooth and only slightly tacky to the touch. If the dough seems too sticky and is not forming a ball, add more flour 1 TBS at a time until a smooth ball is formed. Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead with your hands until it is smooth and elastic (about 3-5 minutes). Form it into a ball. Grease a large bowl and place the dough inside. Cover the bowl with a warm, damp towel and put the bowl in a warm place to rise. Let the dough rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until dough has doubled in size. Make the Filling While the dough is rising, make the filing. In a small bowl, combine butter, brown sugar and cinnamon until mixture is homogenous (uniform throughout).  Set aside. Alternately, you can combine the cinnamon and sugar. Then melt the butter and brush it on the rolled dough, then sprinkle the cinnamon sugar on the butter-brushed dough. (I think this way is easier)! Assemble the Cinnamon Rolls Sprinkle a large work surface with flour. Gently press the gas out of the dough and form it into a rectangle. Roll the dough into a 24×12” rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick. Spread the filling all over the dough using greased hands or a greased spatula. This process can seem difficult but it gets easier as you spread it. (Alternately: if you only combined the cinnamon and sugar, then melt the butter and use a pastry brush to spread the melted butter all over the dough. Then sprinkle the dough with cinnamon sugar and pat it down gently to insure it sticks). Roll up dough cut into 12 equal sized rolls (feel free to measure and cut each roll to be 2” long). Line a 9×13 inch glass baking dish with parchment paper and lightly grease. Then place rolls in 4 rows of three, evenly spaced. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Once rolls are doubled in size, bake them in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20-25 minutes. They will rise more in the oven. (NOTE: Check the center cinnamon rolls and make sure they are baked through. If your oven bakes cool or unevenly you may need to increase the baking time up to 10 minutes longer. If the top starts to brown before the center is baked, tent the baking pan with foil to prevent further browning). Make the Cream Cheese Frosting While rolls are baking, beat together cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract and salt. Do not chill the frosting. Keep it at room temperature until the cinnamon rolls are baked. Once the cinnamon rolls have bene removed from the oven, spread the cream cheese frosting on them while they are still warm. Let cool slightly and serve warm. Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark Video Notes Note on doneness: To ensure the cinnamon rolls are baked properly, measure the internal temperature of the middle of the cinnamon rolls. If it reads 190 degrees F (87 degrees C) they are done! To make ahead: After the cinnamon rolls have been assembled in a baking dish, wrap tightly with plastic wrap and cover with a tea towel or aluminum foil and place them in the refrigerator. In the morning, remove the baking dish from the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature and finish rising (this takes about 30-40 minutes). Then bake according to recipe instructions. To Freeze: Assemble the cinnamon rolls in the baking pan. tightly cover with plastic wrap and then with aluminum foil or a lid. freeze for up to 1 month. To bake, remove cinnamon rolls from the freezer the night before you’d like to bake them. Let them come to room temperature and rise overnight, then bake according to the recipe instructions. If filling “oozes out” If you find some of the cinnamon/sugar filling at the bottom of your baking pan when you pull them out of the oven, immediately place a lid or a baking sheet over the top of the cinnamon rolls and flip them upside down (invert them). This will cause the filling to reincorporate into the rolls!

Set aside for 5 minutes to ""proof"". (If the mixture doesn't get foamy on top, either the yeast is bad or the water was too hot). For instant yeast, add yeast, water and sugar with everything in step 2. In a stand mixer or large bowl add the yeast mixture, warm milk, sugar, melted butter, salt and egg. Add 2 cups of flour and mix until smooth. Add another cup of flour and mix or knead until combined. Continue kneading the dough for about 5 minutes, adding additional flour as or if needed to reach a soft dough that pulls away from the sides and bottom of the bowl and is not overly sticky, but very soft. Be careful not to add too much flour. Place dough in a well-greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 ½ hours. Meanwhile, butter a rimmed bakers half sheet (18x13'') or a 9x13'' pan. Set aside. Dust a work surface lightly with flour, or spray with non-stick cooking spray. Punch down the risen dough and transfer to work surface. Roll it out into about a 20''x18'' rectangle. Spread the 6 tablespoons of softened butter over the top of the dough. Mix sugar and cinnamon together, and then sprinkle over buttered dough, leaving ½ inch border. Sprinkle with walnuts, pecans, or raisins if desired. Beginning on the 18-inch side, role up dough tightly into a log. Pinch the ends together to seal.  Cut into 12 equal portioned pieces (about 1 ½ inches wide). A sharp serrated knife or a piece of floss work well to cut the dough. Arrange rolls on prepared baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap (I like to spray the plastic wrap lightly with cooking spray first, so it doesn't stick to the dough). Allow the rolls to rise again for about an hour, until doubled in volume. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Once risen, uncover rolls and bake for 18-22 minutes or until no longer doughy in the center. While the cinnamon rolls bake, make the icing. Mix butter and powdered sugar together for several minutes. Mix in vanilla, and enough milk to reach a soft frosting consistency. Spread icing over hot cinnamon rolls, right from the oven. Notes Yeast : to substitute Instant or rapid rise yeast skip the first step of proofing. Mix the yeast with 2 cups flour, sugar and salt before adding that to the stand mixer with warm water, milk, egg, and butter. Note that the rolls may rise faster when using instant yeast. Tip for Quick Rise Cinnamon Rolls: Make dough up to first rising, placing it in a well greased bowl, turning it once to grease the dough all over. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Preheat oven to 180 degrees F, then turn oven off. Place bowl into the oven, leaving the oven door slightly cracked open. Allow to rise until doubled. Then remove, punch down and roll out. For Cream Cheese Icing: beat 4 ounces softened cream cheese with the butter. Omit the milk, and mix in vanilla and enough powdered sugar to reach a soft frosting consistency, 1 ½ - 2 cups. Storing Instructions: Once cooled, store leftover cinnamon rolls in an airtight container for up to 2 days at room temperature, or 1 week in the fridge. Rewarm individually in microwave for about 15 seconds or until soft. Make Ahead Instructions: Make dough and assemble rolls through step 7 (just before the second rise).

This develops the gluten strands. *This is where you grab the dough, pinching it with your thumb and pointer finger, and stretch it. If it breaks apart, the gluten strands haven’t developed enough. If you can stretch it to the point of being able to almost see through it, then it is ready. Step 2: Cover And Ferment Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover the dough with a beeswax wrap or plastic wrap. Something tight fitting. Allow to rest in a warm place overnight 8-12 hours. Note: I ferment my dough with eggs with my brioche dough all the time and never have an issue. While I know some others may not feel comfortable doing this, you can ferment it for 4 hours at room temperature and then stick it in the fridge overnight.  Step 3: Add Remaining Dough Ingredients The next day, add baking soda, baking powder, and salt to the dough, and knead for about 5 minutes in the stand mixture or on a floured work surface the all the ingredients are well incorporated.  Step 4: Make Filling In a bowl, combine softened butter, organic brown sugar, and cinnamon. Stir.  Step 5: Roll Out Dough And Add Cinnamon Sugar Place dough on a counter lightly dusted with flour. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch thickness. You may want to use einkorn flour to dust the surface of the counter, so that way you are not getting much modern-day unfermented grains. Recently, I’ve been just rolling the dough out on my countertop and use my bench scraper to roll the rolls. That way I’ve avoided using any unfermented grains. Add butter and cinnamon-sugar filling to the dough and spread evenly. Roll the dough up as tightly as you can. When you get to the end, pull it up tightly and pinch the ends into the main roll.  Step 6: Slice Rolls and Bake You can do this with thread or dental floss. I’m just using thread.  I like to start by making a slice in the middle, and then I cut each half into 6, making 12 total rolls.  Place the unbaked rolls into a well-seasoned 14″ cast iron skillet or a 9×13 baking dish. 12″ will work also, but you may have a little dough leftover. If using a baking dish make sure to butter or grease the bottom of the pan. Bake them in a 375 degree oven for 20-25 minutes or until the rolls are lightly browned and the dough is cooked through. Allow them to cool a bit. Now you can just eat them as they are, or you can make a delicious cream cheese topping. Why not, right?   How To Make Cream Cheese Frosting In a small sauce pan over medium heat, add 6 ounces cream cheese, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup maple syrup or honey, and 2 tsp of vanilla extract.  Stir until combined. I like to use my immersion blender to get the topping really smooth. Pour over cinnamon rolls and enjoy.  How To Store Unfrosted cinnamon rolls can be kept at room temperature for 2-3 days covered. Store frosted cinnamon rolls in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. How To Prepare Sourdough Cinnamon Rolls Ahead Of Time Make the dough according to the directions. Cut and place in a baking dish (don’t add cream until right before baking). Wrap with plastic wrap and place in the fridge (up to 12 hours) or freezer. You don’t want to leave the buns in the fridge too long or they may overproof. Allow to rest on the counter for 2 hours before baking if refrigerated, and overnight if making them from the freezer. Bake according to directions. Baker’s Schedule  12 PM the day before baking: Feed starter, if wanting to use an active sourdough starter. You can also use discard as long as it has been fed recently and just skip this step. Sometimes I will just use it straight out of the fridge and use it like that – as long as I fed it before putting it in the fridge. And it hasn’t been super long since being fed. You can see more about caring for a sourdough starter here . 6-8 PM In a stand mixer, create the dough. Add all the ingredients (minus the baking soda, baking powder, and salt) and knead until smooth and glossy. Cover with plastic wrap (or a tight lid) and allow to ferment overnight. 7-8 AM The Next Morning (or later): Add baking soda, baking powder, and salt to the dough. You can either do this by hand kneading or using the dough hook on a stand mixer. Mix on medium speed for about 5 minutes until the dough forms a ball and isn’t sticky. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle. Spread out the cinnamon, sugar, and butter mixture over the top of the dough. Roll the cinnamon roll up tightly and pinch the seams. Cut into 12 equal rolls and place into a cast iron skillet or baking dish. Bake for 20-25 minutes. Allow to cool a few minutes before serving. While the buns are baking, make the cream cheese icing. FAQ  Can I Freeze Sourdough Cinnamon Rolls? Yes, you can freeze baked cinnamon rolls that have not been frosted, or you can freeze them before the final rise. Cover them with plastic wrap and place in the freezer. Allow them to thaw and rise before baking. Do I have to ferment these overnight? No. If you want to skip the long fermentation process, just add the remaining ingredients and knead together until the windowpane test has been reached. If the dough is too sticky, you may have to add a little bit of flour. Can cinnamon roll dough rise too long? Yes. If allowed to rise too long, they will overproof and won’t hold their shape. What type of baking dish will work best? I love using cast iron skillets because they heat evenly and are easy to clean. But a glass or ceramic baking dish, or even a springform pan will also work. Baking times may vary slightly.

Print Ingredients 1/2 sourdough starter, bubbly and active (113 grams) 1/2 cup water (118 grams) 4 cups all-purpose flour (540 grams) 1/2 cup melted coconut oil 1/2 cup honey (168 grams) 2 eggs 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt Cinnamon Sugar Filling 1/2 cup softened butter (114 grams) 1 cup brown sugar (200 grams) 2 tablespoons cinnamon Cream Cheese Topping: 6 ounces cream cheese 1/2 cup heavy cream (120 grams) 1/2 cup maple syrup or honey (168 grams for honey) 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Instructions In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine active sourdough starter, flour, honey, water, eggs, and melted coconut oil. Mix together until smooth, glossy, and passes the windowpane test. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover the with a beeswax wrap, foil or plastic wrap. Allow to rest in warm place overnight, or up to 12 hours. The next day, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Add the baking soda, baking powder and salt to the dough and mix in the stand mixer on medium speed for about 5 minutes, or knead with you hands. Combine well. In a separate bowl, combine softened butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Stir to combine. Lightly dust the counter with flour, and roll out the dough into a 1/4 inch thick rectangle. Add butter and cinnamon-sugar filling to the top of the dough and spread evenly. Roll the dough up as tightly as you can. When you get to the end, pinch the edge into the main roll, to create a seam. Slice to make 12 even rolls. Place the rolls into a well-seasoned 14"" cast iron skillet or baking dish. Bake at 375 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until the rolls are lightly browned and the dough is cooked through. Allow them to cool a bit. Cream Cheese Topping In a medium saucepan, over medium heat, add cream cheese, heavy cream, maple syrup or honey, and vanilla extract. Stir until combined. Use an immersion blender to get the frosting extra smooth, if desired. Pour over cinnamon rolls and enjoy. Notes You will need active sourdough starter to make this recipe. Active starter refers to a starter that has been fed 4-12 hours before preparing the dough and is nice and bubbly. If the dough seems too stiff, it could be because the house is cooler and the coconut oil has solidified. Place the dough in the oven, turn it on to 150 degrees and leave it on for a few minutes, then turn off the oven. This should warm the dough just enough to make it more pliable. Use string or unflavored dental floss to cut the cinnamon rolls. *This recipe has been edited to reflect changes made over the years of making this recipe. Some people had issues incorporating the eggs on the second day, so I changed this and started mixing them into the dough the night before. This works amazingly well. *Another change is I am no longer recommending adding the cream to the top. I just found it unnecessary.

cb7441e5,https://www.savorynothings.com/homemade-cinnamon-rolls/,The Best Homemade Cinnamon Rolls,"Here is a visual overview of the ingredients in the recipe. Scroll down to the printable recipe card at the bottom of this post for quantities! Ingredients for homemade Cinnamon Rolls: Flour, brown sugar, white sugar, milk, eggs. butter, yeast, cinnamon and salt. If you want to slather your cinnamon rolls with my 1 minute homemade frosting, you’ll also need these: Ingredients for easy Cream Cheese Frosting: Cream cheese, icing sugar, vanilla extract and salt. Ingredient notes Sugar: If you prefer, you can use all white OR all brown sugar for the filling. All brown will yield a more caramel-like taste. All white will make the filling sweeter. Milk: I prefer whole milk for a richer dough, but feel free to use any fat percentage you have at home. Yeast: Use active dried yeast for best results. You can use instant yeast, the dough will rise faster. The rolls tend to have a slightly “yeastier” taste with instant yeast. Organic yeast will rise much slower, so plan accordingly if you’re planning on using that. Butter: I recommend using real butter here. If you have to use margarine for any kind of reason, please use stick margarine for best results. How to make homemade Cinnamon Rolls 1. Start by activating the yeast: Place it in a small bowl with some milk and sugar. Stir well, then let sit for 5 minutes. If you see bubbles appearing on the surface, your yeast is good to go! If you don’t see any bubbles within 10 minutes, you need to use a new packet of yeast.  2. Next, add all ingredients for the dough to the bowl of your stand mixer. (If you don’t have a hand mixer, you need to knead by hand – stir the ingredients together in the bowl first, then knead on your counter). You want to knead the dough on medium speed until it’s completely smooth and pliable. You should be able to pull a piece of dough until it’s see-through thin, without it ripping apart. This can take 10 minutes! So be patient.  3. Now, transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl. I recommend using a ceramic bowl for best results. You an leave it in the metal bowl from your stand mixer if you must, but it never gives me the same results as a ceramic bowl! You’ll want to shape the dough into a ball, pinching the bottom together to create a smooth surface on top. Place the ball, seam down, in your prepared bowl.  Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel and let it sit at comfortably warm room temperature until doubled in size. 4. Now, roll the dough into a rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Spread with butter, then sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.  5. Roll the dough up into a firm log and pinch the seam to seal.  6. Slice the cinnamon roll log into rolls. I like using a piece of sewing thread or dental floss for super neat rolls!  7. Place the rolls in a greased 9×13 inch dish, cover and let sit until puffy.  Now just bake, then frost warm in the pan!  Recipe tips Timing of rise The exact timing will depend on many factors, including: your room temperature (cooler room = slower rise) your bowl (really! ceramic bowls are warmer, so if you want your dough to rise faster, don’t leave it in your mixer’s stainless steel bowl) your altitude (higher altitude = faster rise) your yeast (instant yeast = fast rise; active yeast = regular rise; organic yeast = slow rise) Note: This stage can also be done in the fridge overnight! Just make sure to remove the dough from the fridge 15-30 minutes before continuing with the recipe, so it can warm up. Cutting Now this is where the real magic happens! Ever rolled a beautiful log of cinnamon rolls, only to then destroy their beautiful round shape by running a knife through them? It’s actually way easier, neater and prettier to cut them with a piece of sewing thread or some unscented dental floss. Check out my recipe video up in this post or down in the recipe card to see how it’s done! place a piece of sewing string underneath the log… … cross it over… … then pull to slice off a cinnamon roll Baking Cinnamon rolls are supposed to be soft and a bit gooey, so don’t overbake them – they’ll be dry. It’s perfectly fine if they turn a light golden on top, but they shouldn’t turn out crispy and dark brown on top. Be sure to watch them like a hawk ! No shame in hanging out in front of your oven just to get that perfect batch of homemade cinnamon rolls 🙂 Frosting I like to let my cinnamon rolls cool for about 5 minutes, then I frost them warm straight in the pan. This will keep the top of your cinnamon rolls extra-soft, but the frosting will also kind of sink in as they cool. If you have leftovers and are a huge fan of the frosting, you might need to spread on some more.  Cinnamon Roll FAQs Why are my cinnamon rolls tough? Tough cinnamon rolls are usually the result of a tough dough. Make sure you do not add too much flour to the dough, it is a very soft dough – it just shouldn’t be paste-like or overly sticky. Add any extra flour one tablespoon at a time and mix it in for a minute before adding more. What can I use instead of cinnamon in cinnamon rolls? You can try using a spice blend such as pumpkin pie spice or gingerbread spice . Cardamom is also really delicious, it goes well with grated orange zest and a touch of ground ginger. How do you keep the filling from spilling out? Sometimes, the filling can leak out from the bottom of the rolls. If you let the rolls sit for a little, they will soak back up some of the filling as they cool. You can also remove one roll, then tilt the pan (careful if it’s still hot – use an oven glove!) and use a spoon to catch any leaked filling. Spoon it back over the rolls before frosting them.","You can do the first rise in the fridge overnight. Make sure to remove the dough from the fridge about 30 minutes before continuing with the recipe. I suppose you could try letting the finished rolls do the second rise in the fridge overnight if you know you’ll be short on time in the morning! They may need a few extra minutes to bake, be sure to watch them in the oven. Freezer instructions I recommend freezing the baked, unfrosted rolls. I separate them for convenience, that way we can pull out as many as we need. Flash freeze the separated cinnamon rolls, spaced apart, on a baking sheet for 1-2 hours, until solid. Once frozen, wrap each in foil and place them into a large freezer bag. Label with the name and use-by date (freeze for up to 3 months). To reheat, leave them at room temperature for 10 minutes, then unwrap. Either defrost at room temperature on a wire rack. OR defrost in the microwave. Warm them in the microwave for 30 seconds, or in the oven at 300°F until warm. Frost them, if you like, then serve.

This will take 30-45 seconds in the microwave – do not use milk that is hotter than 105°F, or you will destroy the yeast! Place yeast in small bowl with 1 tablespoon warm milk and 1 teaspoon granulated sugar. Stir, then let sit for 5 minutes, until bubbles appear on the surface. Place flour, butter, salt, eggs, yeast mixture, remaining milk and sugar in the bowl of your stand mixer. Stir a little to roughly combine. Knead dough in the mixer with the dough hook attached on medium speed until dough forms a ball. Dough should be completely smooth. If dough doesn't form a ball: Add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time with the mixer running on low speed, until dough pulls together (do not add too much flour, or dough will have a biscuit-like texture). Kneading can take around 10-12 minutes, so be patient. Turn dough out into a greased bowl. Shape into a ball, pinching the bottom to form a smooth surface. Place it seam down, then cover with a clean tea towel. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Shape the cinnamon rolls Dust work surface with flour. Turn out dough on floured surface, punch down and shape into a rectangle. Roll dough into rectangle, about 18×12 inches. Dough should be around ¼ inch thick. Spread 1 stick softened butter over dough. Combine both sugars and the cinnamon for the filling in a small bowl. Evenly sprinkle over butter. Roll up into a log from the longer side and pinch the seam to seal. Place log seam-side down. Slice into 12 rolls (I use a piece of sewing thread or dental floss for neat rolls). Place rolls in greased 9×13 inch pan. Cover with the tea towel and let sit until puffy and almost doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Bake cinnamon rolls As rolls rise, heat oven to 350°F. Bake risen rolls in the hot oven until lightly golden brown. This takes around 18 minutes. Be sure to check the rolls often. If center rolls aren't baked after 20 minutes, tent pan with aluminum foil and continue baking for up to 15-20 extra minutes (this can happen if your room was cool and the dough is colder due to it). Frost rolls Place ingredients for the frosting in a medium mixing bowl. Beat with a hand mixer until smooth. Once cinnamon rolls are done, remove pan form oven and place on a wire rack. Let sit for 5 minutes, then frost rolls while warm. Let cinnamon rolls cool until they can be touched, then serve warm. Want to save this recipe?

dc3f3c0e,https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/homemade-cinnamon-rolls/,Homemade Cinnamon Rolls,"Milk . 2% milk is what I traditionally use for the dough. Whole milk or non-dairy almond or coconut milk works too. Yeast. I have much success with instant yeast . You can also use active dry yeast. Eggs. Large eggs are standard. I have not tried any replacement for eggs in this recipe. Butter. The original recipe called for ⅓ cup butter, but since I’ve made it over the years, one tweak I made was to increase the butter to ½ cup. See this in the notes I made in the recipe card. I highly recommend it! Sugars. Granulated sugar goes in the dough. Brown sugar is in the filling. Dark brown sugar is also delicious. Salt. Although we use salted butter, we still add 1 teaspoon of salt to the dough. Flour. Bread flour will help the rolls have a fluffier, chewy but sturdier texture. If you don’t have bread flour, use all-purpose flour. Cinnamon. Use Saigon cinnamon in this filling. Heavy cream. Heavy cream is what gives the best results. Evaporated milk, whole milk or half and half works too. Don’t skip this! It’s what makes gooey cinnamon rolls. Cream cheese. Full fat cream cheese is for the frosting. Powdered sugar. Maple or vanilla extract. I love, love maple flavor for my yeast cinnamon rolls, but vanilla extract works just as well.","Pour the warm milk (115ºF) in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast overtop. Allow this to sit for 3-4 minutes. The yeast will get a little frothy to show it is activated. 1 cup warm milk , 2 ½ teaspoons instant dry yeast* – Add the room temperature eggs, butter and sugar. Mix until combined. 2 large eggs , ⅓ cup salted butter** , ½ cup granulated sugar Add in salt and 4 cups (save the other ½ cup and add only if you need it) of flour and mix using the beater blade just until the ingredients are barely combined. Allow the mixture to rest for 5 minutes so the flour has time to soak up the liquids. 1 teaspoon salt , 4 ½ cups all-purpose flour Scrape the dough off the beater blade and remove it. Attach the dough hook. To knead, beat the dough on medium speed for 5-7 minutes, adding in up to ½ cup more flour only if needed to form a dough. The dough should be elastic and smooth. **The dough should be tacky and will pull away from the sides of the bowl but may stick slightly to the bottom. That's ok! Don't be tempted to add more flour at this point. We generally add about 4 ¼ cups, but start with 4 cups. Spray a large bowl with cooking spray. Use a rubber spatula to remove the dough from the mixer bowl and place it in the greased large bowl. Cover the bowl with a towel or wax paper. Set the bowl in a warm place and allow the dough to rise until double. I like to turn on the oven to the lowest setting for 1-2 minutes. Then turn off the oven and place the dough to rise in there. It normally takes about 30 minutes for the dough to rise. Do not allow the dough to rise too much or your cinnamon rolls will be airy. While the dough is rising, prepare the cinnamon filling. In a medium bowl, combine the soft butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, mixing until well combined. Set aside. ½ cup salted butter , 1 cup packed brown sugar , 2 tablespoons cinnamon Sprinkle a pastry mat or work surface generously with flour. Turn out the dough onto the surface and sprinkle the top of the dough with additional flour. Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough to about a 24×15"" rectangle. (the size of the rectangle can vary…it does not have to be exact!) Use a rubber spatula to smooth the cinnamon filling over the whole dough rectangle. Starting on the long side, roll the dough up tightly jelly roll style. Cut into 12 slices and place in a greased 9×13 baking pan.**** Cover the pan and allow the rolls to rise for 20 minutes while the oven is preheating. Preheat the oven to 375ºF. Warm the heavy cream until the chill is off. Don't make it hot…you just don't want it cold. It should be warm to the touch. Once the rolls have risen, pour the heavy cream over the top of the rolls, allowing it to soak down in and around the rolls. ½ cup heavy cream*** Bake in a preheated oven for 25 minutes, until the rolls are lightly golden brown and the center rolls are cooked through. Note…the time will vary based on how big the rolls are, what type of pan, how close the rolls are packed, etc. They could take up to 30 minutes. Check the rolls at 20 minutes. If they are getting too browned, cover loosely with foil for the remaining baking time. While the rolls are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting.

ea060f46,https://houseofnasheats.com/tiktok-cinnamon-rolls/,TikTok Cinnamon Rolls,"Scroll down to the recipe card below this post for ingredient quantities and full instructions. Refrigerated jumbo-sized cinnamon rolls - It doesn't have to be Pillsbury Grands! Rhodes frozen cinnamon rolls are awesome (but hard to find in my area). You can also use Trader Joes cinnamon rolls or basically any refrigerated cinnamon rolls in a tube that you like. Heavy cream - This is the not-so-secret ingredient that makes regular cinnamon rolls extra gooey. The added moisture is absorbed into the cinnamon rolls for a soft, fluffy result that is amazing. Cream cheese - We're elevating regular Pillsbury cinnamon roll icing by adding some softened cream cheese. Powdered sugar - This also helps stretch the cinnamon roll icing that comes with the tube of refrigerated cinnamon rolls since there never seems to be quite enough. Vanilla extract - A little vanilla balances the cinnamon flavor and makes it more interesting. Salted butter - Another trick that is mentioned in some of the viral TikTok videos is to drizzle melted butter mixed with ground cinnamon and brown sugar over the cinnamon rolls before baking to make them that much more extra. It works. Brown sugar - For the buttery, cinnamon-sugar drizzle. Ground cinnamon - Keeps the cinnamon flavor front and center for these sweet rolls.  How to Make TikTok Cinnamon Rolls Unwrap cinnamon rolls. Peel the paper off the tube of whatever cinnamon roll dough you are working with and arrange them in a large 9x13-inch baking dish. You can also easily halve the recipe and use a smaller baking dish if you don't want as many cinnamon rolls. Drizzle heavy cream. Go ahead and pour the heavy cream right over and around the cinnamon rolls. The goal is to cover the bottom of the pan and make sure there is a little cream between each of the rolls.  Make brown sugar cinnamon topping. Melt butter in a medium bowl, then stir in the brown sugar and ground cinnamon to create a slurry. Spoon this over each of the cinnamon rolls. Cover and bake. Cover the pan with a large piece of aluminum foil, then bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 to 40 minutes. The timing can somewhat depend on the brand of cinnamon rolls, how tightly spaced they are in your pan, and your oven. They should be golden brown on top and cooked through but still very moist when done.  Make frosting. Meanwhile, beat cream cheese with the icing that came with the can of cinnamon roll dough until smooth. Add powdered sugar and vanilla extract and beat again. Cool, then frost. Once the cinnamon rolls are done, remove the foil and let them cool for about 5 minutes before frosting. This prevents the frosting from being completely absorbed by the cinnamon rolls, but they are still warm enough for the frosting to sort of melt around and into them, which adds another layer of gooeyness that we love. Serve warm!  Recipe FAQ's Does adding the heavy cream make the cinnamon rolls soggy? Nope! It just makes them extra gooey, like Cinnabon. Can I halve this recipe? Absolutely! You can make this recipe in a 9-inch round or square cake pan using just one can of refrigerated cinnamon rolls if you don't want as many. Can I make these in advance? You can assemble them 1-2 days ahead of time and cover well with plastic wrap. Store them in the fridge until you are ready to bake. They really are best when made fresh. Does this cinnamon roll hack work on regular homemade cinnamon rolls? Yes, actually! If you want to make these completely homemade, use your favorite cinnamon roll recipe and just pour ¾ to 1 cup of heavy cream around them before baking and you'll get the same extra moist result.  Tips for Success Leave some space between the cinnamon rolls so they can expand while they bake. If you crowd the pan too much, they won't bake as well. Be sure to cover with foil. This allows the cinnamon rolls to soak up the cream better without drying out on top or burning before they have a chance to cook all the way through. Let the cinnamon rolls cool a few minutes before frosting. If you frost them right away the frosting will melt right into the cinnamon rolls. I actually like that to some extent so I still frost them while they are warm, but not piping hot right out of the oven. Variations Add fruit. Add some fresh peach slices, apple pie filling, cherry pie filling, blueberries, raspberries, or sliced strawberries right on top and down between the cinnamon rolls before adding the cream and baking. Go nuts. Add ¾ cup chopped pecans to the brown sugar and butter mixture. You could even do this first, then place the cinnamon rolls on top. After baking, flip the whole thing upside down for easy pecan sticky buns. Try maple icing! Add ½ teaspoon of maple extract to your frosting for a delicious maple icing twist!  What to Serve With Cinnamon Rolls Whether you are serving these for a weekend family breakfast or a brunch with friends, don't forget all the delicious sides along with glasses of cold milk! Here are some of our favorites. Green Chili Egg Casserole Oven Baked Bacon Smoked Salmon Scrambled Eggs Hashbrowns Fresh Fruit Salad Easy, Ultimate Breakfast Frittata","Although these are best eaten fresh, they will keep at room temperature on the counter in an airtight container for 2-3 days. You can also freeze the baked cinnamon rolls for up to 2 months. Thaw completely on the counter and reheat. Keep in mind that the frosting will sort of melt into the cinnamon rolls, so if your plan is to freeze them you might want to freeze the frosting separately (it freezes great!) then thaw and add it when you are reheating the cinnamon rolls before serving.

So easy to make using canned Pillsbury Grands cinnamon rolls, we're taking these refrigerated favorites to the next level with just a few extra ingredients that make them extra delicious and taste like they are homemade with just 5 minutes of prep. Ingredients 1 2 3 Cinnamon Rolls ▢ 2 (17.5-ounce) cans refrigerated cinnamon rolls (Grands or similar) ▢ ¾ cup heavy cream ▢ 6 Tablespoons salted butter, melted ▢ ¾ cup brown sugar ▢ 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon Icing ▢ Icing from cinnamon rolls (from above) ▢ 2 ounces cream cheese, softened ▢ 2 Tablespoons salted butter, softened ▢ ½ teaspoon vanilla extract ▢ 1 cup powdered sugar Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark Instructions Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with baking spray. Open cinnamon roll dough and arrange in the prepared pan, spacing them apart so they have room to rise. Set aside icing. Pour heavy cream over and around the cinnamon rolls until it covers the bottom of the pan. Combine melted butter, brown sugar, and ground cinnamon in a small bowl. Stir until combined, then spoon or pour over the cinnamon rolls. Cover the pan with aluminum foil. Bake for 30-40 minutes until lightly browned on top and cooked through. You may want to remove the foil during the last 5-10 minutes if they aren't brown enough for you. Beat softened cream cheese and butter with a hand mixer until creamy and smooth. Add vanilla extract and the icing from the cinnamon rolls, mixing well. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, then mix in the powdered sugar until combined. Let the cinnamon rolls cool for 3-5 minutes before topping them with the prepared icing. Serve warm. Notes Amount adjustments: Many popular versions of this recipe use 1 cup of heavy cream, but I found during recipe testing that ¾ cup was plenty while the full amount was just a bit too much. Icing: The extra icing can be omitted, but I found making the extra icing helped it taste even more homemade. You can also add ½ tsp maple extract for a yummy maple version. Storage: Although these are best eaten fresh, they will keep at room temperature on the counter in an airtight container for 2-3 days. Freezing: You can also freeze the baked cinnamon rolls for up to 2 months. Thaw completely on the counter and reheat. Keep in mind that the frosting will sort of melt into the cinnamon rolls, so if your plan is to freeze them you might want to freeze the frosting separately (it freezes great!) then thaw and add it when you are reheating the cinnamon rolls before serving. Add fruit: Add some fresh peach slices, apple pie filling, cherry pie filling, blueberries, raspberries, or sliced strawberries right on top and down between the cinnamon rolls before adding the cream and baking. Add nuts: Add ¾ cup chopped pecans to the brown sugar and butter mixture. You could even do this first, then place the cinnamon rolls on top.

7bdb4408,https://bromabakery.com/homemade-cinnamon-rolls-soft-fluffy/,Homemade Cinnamon Rolls (Soft + Fluffy!),"Cinnamon rolls are one of those magical confections that taste like they have a million ingredients in them but actually call for basic pantry staples you probably already have on hand. Here’s your grocery list for these homemade cinnamon rolls: All Purpose Flour: All purpose flour is perfect for creating a pillowy soft, tender, slightly bready dough. I’ve also had success making these with bread flour, but I find bread flour makes them a bit chewier! Granulated Sugar: You’ll need a little granulated sugar to active the yeast and also to sweeten your dough slightly! Instant Yeast: We usually use Fleischmann’s Rapid Rise for these homemade cinnamon rolls, but any rapid instant yeast will work here! You can also use regular active yeast and double the rise times! Butter: You’ll need butter for both the cinnamon roll dough and the cream cheese frosting. We prefer using unsalted butter so you can control how much salty is going into your baked goods! That being said, if all you have on hand is salted butter that will work totally fine too! In the dough you’ll use melted butter and in the cinnamon sugar filling you’ll need room temperature butter, so be sure to leave some butter out on the counter for an hour or so to get it nice and soft! Milk: Any kind of milk will work in this recipe, but for a super soft, buttery dough we recommend using whole milk! Eggs: These homemade cinnamon rolls are an enriched dough, meaning the recipe calls for eggs. The eggs will give your dough a soft structure! Cinnamon: UH DUH. You’ll need cinnamon for the cinnamon sugar filling! Sometimes when I’m feeling spicy, I put 1 teaspoon in the dough too! Brown Sugar: Brown sugar is the perfect, caramel-y, soft sugar to use for your cinnamon sugar filling. You can feel free to use light brown sugar or dark brown sugar, but you we do not recommend subbing it out for granulated sugar–it won’t melt in the same way! Pure Vanilla Extract: The amount of vanilla extract in this recipe may be small, but she is mighty! A few teaspoons will take your rolls from good to great! Cream Cheese: In my opinion it’s not a cinnamon roll if its not absolutely smothered in cream cheese frosting. It’s imperative that you use room temperature cream cheese to get that nice creamy, smooth consistency. Powdered Sugar: You’ll need powdered sugar to sweeten and thicken your cream cheese frosting.  How to make the best cinnamon rolls Cinnamon rolls are a more involved process than your standard chocolate chip cookie or muffin recipe…I get it. It can seem a little daunting. But luckily we’ve broken everything down for you so you’ll be a homemade cinnamon roll baking pro in no time! Cinnamon rolls require making three components (dough, cinnamon sugar, and cream cheese frosting) and this homemade cinnamon roll recipe needs 2 rises so you’ll have to be a little patient too. But isn’t that the fun in baked goods sometimes? Cinnamon rolls are a special treat and all that extra work and love makes them even more delicious. . Make the cinnamon roll dough and knead f0r 10 minutes in a stand mixer or by hand until it passes the window pane test. Let the dough rise for 1 hour. Roll out the dough into a large rectangle, spread with the filling, and roll up! Slice the cinnamon rolls using a very sharp knife or unflavored dental floss into 12 equal pieces and place into a baking pan (I love a 9 x 13). Let the rolls rise for another hour. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown. .  7. Finally, Top with cream cheese icing. Lick the spoon (obviously), and dive into your gooey homemade cinnamon rolls!  How to know when to stop kneading your cinnamon roll dough If you watch any baking shows (looking at you, The Great British Bake Off), you’ve maybe heard of “the windowpane test.” This is the easiest and simplest way to test if your dough has developed enough gluten (bonds in the dough that will give it that nice dough-y, cinnamon roll texture). Rip off a small piece of dough and place it between your fingers, gently spreading your fingers apart to stretch out the dough. If the dough can stretch out and get translucent (I like to hold it up to a window and see that light passes through it), you’ve kneaded it long enough and you can shape it and place it in a bowl to rise. If the dough rips and will not stretch out you’ll need to knead your dough more. Place the piece of dough back with the rest of it and knead the dough for a few more minutes (1 or 2 should do it!) and repeat the test until your dough passes with flying colors!  Tips for baking with yeast for beginners Now I know that cinnamon rolls can feel a little intimidating. Homemade dough, multiple rises, proofing…I get it. But believe me when I tell you that it is so so SO worth it for a gooey homemade cinnamon roll hot from the oven. Plus, once you get the hang of baking with yeast, it’s not so hard! Plus you’ll get the dreamiest, soft, slightly bready dough that tastes worthy of a bakery in no time. Who knew homemade could be so easy? Make sure your yeast is fresh: There is NOTHING worse than going through all the kneading and steps of cinnamon roll baking and then coming back to your dough after its first rise and finding it flat. It’s happened to me before and it’s truly soul crushing. You don’t have to activate instant yeast, but Let the dough have its full rise time: Yeasted dough requires some extra time and planning but it’s so worth it for homemade cinnamon rolls. Make sure you give the dough the full rise time for the ultimate soft and fluffy dough. If you try to rush the process you can end up with sad, dense rolls.  Tips for the perfect homemade cinnamon rolls If you’re new to yeasted dough, follow the recipe closely, trust the process, and keep at it! Use high quality ingredients: You saw the shopping list–cinnamon rolls use just a few, basic ingredients, so their quality will really shine through in the finished product. Use good butter, real cream cheese and high quality cinnamon! Don’t over bake them: I think we can all agree that the best part of a cinnamon roll is the gooey, slightly under baked center. It’s a fine line between over baked and too doughy, so keep an eye on them in the last 10 minutes of baking and remember that they will continue to bake as they cool! Eat them warm: Cinnamon rolls are best hot from the oven (duh.), but don’t worry if you have leftovers that you want to enjoy later. Simply pop your cinnamon roll in the microwave for 20 seconds to get it gooey and warm again!  How to store these cinnamon rolls so they stay pillowy soft and fluffy In the unlikely scenario that these cinnamon rolls aren’t inhaled on the spot, you can absolutely store these for later! Here are our top tips for storing these homemade cinnamon rolls so they stay pillowy soft for days! Underbake the rolls slightly: This is the cardinal rule of cinnamon roll baking. The best part about homemade cinnamon rolls is that slightly underbaked doughy center. This will also help the rolls stay moist and soft if you’re storing them! Only frost the cinnamon rolls you’re planning on eating: Frosting can get a little weird when it goes through a bunch of temperature changes. I find these cinnamon rolls keep best unfrosted so they don’t get soggy. Simply keep the frosting in a container in the fridge and frost your cinnamon roll when you’re ready to eat it! Store in an airtight container or tightly wrapped: This will help seal out any air and keep your homemade cinnamon rolls soft! Heat up before eating : Cinnamon rolls are always best ooey gooey and warm. Simply pop your cinnamon roll in the microwave for 30 seconds or in a 350°F oven for 10 minutes to heat it back up to that fresh baked warmth!  Can you make these cinnamon rolls the night before?

Mix to combine. In a microwave safe bowl, microwave the milk and butter for 30 seconds until warm and the butter is mostly melted. The mixture should be warm, but not hot. If it is too hot, make sure to let it cool before adding to the yeast to prevent killing the yeast. Add the warm milk and butter to the flour mixture. Add the egg. Beat on low speed, gradually increasing to high until completely combined, about 2 minutes. Change the paddle attachment to the dough hook, scrape down the bowl and add 1 more cup of flour, beating until combined. Add the remaining cup of flour in a little at a time until the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl and form a ball. Turn the dough out onto a well floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until smooth and you can stretch a piece of dough out between your fingers without it breaking. This means the gluten has developed and your dough will be pillowy soft. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl and cover. Let rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size. While the dough rises, make the filling. Combine the sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in a small bowl and mix well. Set aside. Once the dough has risen, roll it out into a long rectangle about 18 x 12 inches on a well floured surface. Spread the butter for the filling all the way to the edge of the dough. Sprinkle the sugar mixture over the butter, pressing it down to stick to the butter. From the long end, roll the dough away from you into a tight roll, sealing the bottom edge down by pinching the dough together. Use floss or a very sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 even rolls. Place the rolls in a 9 x 13 inch pan lined with parchment paper . Cover loosely with a dish cloth and allow to rise for another hour until doubled in size and puffed up. Bake the cinnamon rolls at 350°F for 30 minutes or until they are golden brown and no longer doughy. Allow to cool. While the rolls cool, make the cream cheese frosting. In a stand mixer fit with the whisk attachment combine the cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, milk, salt, and vanilla extract.Beat on low speed, gradually increasing to high until light and fluffy. Spread the icing evenly over the 12 rolls. Enjoy warm! Notes If you would like to make the cinnamon rolls the day before, you can make the dough as directed through step 11 (cutting out the rolls and placing them in the pan), but instead of letting the rolls have their second rise, cover them and place them in the fridge overnight. In the morning, take the rolls out of the fridge and leave on the counter for an hour to warm up and double in size before baking as directed! sharing is caring Did you make this recipe?

Remove from heat and stir in the sour cream until smooth. Let cool until lukewarm** (about 110°F). In the bowl of an electric mixer, use a spatula to combine the milk mixture with the yeast, sugar, egg, egg yolks, and vanilla until well combined. Add in half of the flour and the salt and stir until combined. Place on a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook and gradually add the remaining flour until a dough begins to form. Only add as much flour as you need to form the dough. Knead at medium speed until the dough is very soft, smooth, pliable, elastic, and doesn’t stick to the sides of the bowl, about 8 to 10 minutes. If the dough is unbearably sticky, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time. Only add as much flour as needed to create a smooth dough. Lightly grease a large bowl. Shape the dough into a ball and place in the greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Make the filling: Once the dough has risen, add filling ingredients to a medium mixing bowl. Beat with a hand-held electric mixer on medium-high until well combined and fluffy, about 3 minutes. To shape the dough: Punch down the risen dough and turn out onto a lightly floured work surface. Use a rolling pin to shape the dough into a 16×12-inch rectangle, long side facing you. Spread the filling mixture all over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border at the far edge. Brush the border with water to help seal. Roll the dough up, pulling with your hands to keep it tightly rolled until it’s an even log shape. Press the border to seal. Trim the edges. Lightly flour the roll. Grease a 13×9-inch baking dish or two 9-inch pie pans . Cut the roll into 12 equal pieces using a sharp knife or unflavored dental floss. Place the rolls cut side up in the prepared baking dish.

70b886b6,https://www.spendwithpennies.com/homemade-cinnamon-rolls/,Homemade Cinnamon Roll Recipe,"Yeast : Active dry yeast is mixed with sugar and warm. If the yeast doesn’t get foamy, it should not be used. Flour : All-purpose flour or bread flour can be used. I use all-purpose flour since it’s what I usually have on hand. Butter and eggs : Use unsalted butter and add your own salt. Eggs add flavor and help with the rise, while the butter adds flavor and texture. Cinnamon Sugar Filling : The filling for these cinnamon buns is a mixture of brown sugar and ground cinnamon. Use either dark or light brown sugar.  How to Make Cinnamon Rolls Proof the yeast : Combine the yeast with warm water and sugar. The mixture should become foamy. Make the dough : Warm the milk and butter in a separate bowl. Add the remaining dough ingredients, including the yeast mixture, and knead the dough until smooth. Let the dough rise : Place it in a warm place for about an hour or until doubled in size. Add the filling and bake : Roll the dough into a rectangle, spread with softened butter, and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Roll the dough and cut it into individual rolls. Place the rolls in a prepared baking dish and bake them in the oven until they are golden brown. Enjoy! Once the rolls are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool before serving. Don’t forget the cream cheese frosting ! Prepare dough Let it rise Spread with butter Add cinnamon sugar and roll Cinnamon Roll Pro Tip You can use a piece of dental floss to cut the cinnamon roll dough into even pieces. This method helps to avoid squishing the soft dough and gives you more precise cuts than a knife. Use unflavored dental floss, as nobody wants minty cinnamon rolls!  Cinnamon Roll Icing Cream cheese icing is my favorite way to top fluffy cinnamon rolls. This icing needs cream cheese, butter, and powdered sugar with vanilla for flavor. Be sure to let the rolls cool down before adding the frosting, or the butter in the frosting may melt. If you’d prefer, you can skip the frosting and drizzle with glaze.  Tips for The Best Cinnamon Rolls Make sure that all ingredients are at room temperature. Check the expiration date on your yeast. Expired yeast can prevent the dough from rising properly. Use this yeast testing method to check your yeast. Allow the dough to rise in a warm place and cover it lightly with a kitchen towel. You can add chopped pecans, coconut, or raisins to the filling if you like. If the rolls are browning too quickly in the oven, cover them loosely with foil to prevent them from getting too dark. To Prepare The Night Before My family has dubbed this the best cinnamon roll recipe, and I love that it can be made ahead of time and refrigerated overnight for an easy breakfast. Cover the prepared cinnamon rolls in a greased 9×13-inch pan with plastic wrap. When you’re ready to bake the rolls, remove them from the fridge and remove the plastic wrap. With the oven off, cover the rolls with a towel and place a bowl or pan of very hot water in the oven to allow them to rise. To bake, remove the rolls from the oven (leave the water in the oven) and preheat the oven to the temperature specified in the recipe. Bake according to the recipe instructions. The hot water will help to create steam and keep the rolls soft and fluffy as they bake. To prepare your cinnamon rolls in advance, follow these steps: Storing Leftover Rolls Cinnamon rolls can be stored at room temperature for 2 to 3 days. Keep the frosting separate, (store it in the refrigerator) and add it to each roll as you enjoy them. You can also freeze cinnamon rolls by wrapping them tightly or storing them in an airtight container. You can even individually freeze the rolls for quick treats. The cream cheese frosting can also be frozen, either on the buns or in a separate container.

Combine the water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar in a small bowl. Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes or until it becomes foamy. In a saucepan, combine the milk, butter, remaining granulated sugar, and salt. Heat the mixture to 120-130°F using a thermometer. Place 2 cups of flour in a stand mixer. Add the eggs, milk mixture, and yeast mixture and mix until combined. Using a dough hook, add the flour ½ cup at a time until the dough forms a soft ball that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it on a lightly floured surface until it is smooth and elastic (about 8 minutes). Place the dough in a greased bowl in a warm place and cover it with a towel for 1 hour or until it has doubled in size. Roll the dough out into a 15"" x 12"" rectangle. Spread butter on the dough and top it with the brown sugar and cinnamon. Roll the dough up, starting on the long side. Cut it into 15 pieces and place them in the prepared pan. Cover rolls with a towel and allow them to rise 30-45 minutes. Preheat oven to 375°F. Brush rolls with milk and bake 20-25 minutes. Frosting While the rolls are baking, combine frosting ingredients with a mixer until fluffy. Allow rolls to cool for about 10-15 minutes and spread frosting on warm rolls. Video Notes Double check the date on your yeast to ensure it has not expired. If you do not have a stand mixer , this recipe will still work but will take a little bit of work to get the dough nice and smooth. Mix in as much of the flour as you can with a spoon and then continue mixing it in by hand. Once the dough is not too sticky, place it on the counter with a little bit of flour and knead it until it is smooth and elastic. This will take about 10 minutes. Bread Machine This dough can be prepared in a bread machine. Combine dough ingredients in the order specified by your bread machine. Set on dough cycle. Let dough rest for 10 minutes once completed and continue with recipe as above. Cutting the rolls: Once rolled into a long log, you will want to cut your cinnamon rolls. Rather than a knife, I use a piece of dental floss. This cuts the rolls evenly without squishing the soft dough. (Be sure it’s not flavored floss, nobody wants minty cinnamon rolls). To Make Ahead Once prepared, place rolls in a prepared pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours. With the oven turned off , place rolls in the oven and place a bowl or pan of very hot water in the oven next to the rolls. Allow to rise 45 minutes or until doubled in size. To bake, remove the rolls from the oven (leave the water in the oven) and preheat the oven to the temperature specified in the recipe. Place the rolls in the oven, close the door, and bake according to the recipe instructions. The hot water will help to create steam and keep the rolls soft and fluffy as they bake. 4.97 from 281 votes Nutrition Information Calories: 406 | Carbohydrates: 59 g | Protein: 6 g | Fat: 17 g | Saturated Fat: 10 g | Cholesterol: 66 mg | Sodium: 257 mg | Potassium: 103 mg | Fiber: 2 g | Sugar: 30 g | Vitamin A: 566 IU | Calcium: 58 mg | Iron: 2 mg Nutrition information provided is an estimate and will vary based on cooking methods and brands of ingredients used.

e106c0d8,https://www.loveandlemons.com/cinnamon-rolls/,Cinnamon Rolls,"Here’s what you’ll need to make this cinnamon roll recipe: Active dry yeast or instant yeast – Even if you’re using instant yeast, you’ll proof it with cane sugar and warm water before mixing it into the dough. Coconut oil (or melted butter) and almond milk – Most cinnamon roll recipes call for butter and regular milk, but, as a vegan option, this recipe works perfectly with coconut oil and almond milk. Sugar – It makes the cinnamon roll dough lightly sweet. Sea salt – Essential for a flavorful dough. All-purpose flour – Spoon and level it to avoid packing too much into your measuring cup. Dark brown sugar and cinnamon – They create the delicious cinnamon sugar filling. Powdered sugar , vanilla extract, and more almond milk – For the glaze! It’s sweet, gooey, and quick and easy to mix together. If you love cream cheese icing on cinnamon rolls, top them with my vegan frosting or cream cheese frosting instead. Find the complete recipe with measurements below.  How to Make Cinnamon Rolls I love how easy it is to make this recipe. No stand mixer required! Here’s how it goes: First, make the dough. Start by proofing the yeast. Mix it with warm water and sugar in a small bowl, and set it aside for 5 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy. If it doesn’t foam, discard the mixture and start again with new yeast. Next, mix together the wet ingredients—the coconut oil, almond milk, sugar, and salt—in a medium bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture.  Place the flour in a large bowl and pour in the wet ingredients. Stir to combine, and then use your hands to knead the mixture until it comes together into a rough dough. Next, keep kneading! Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and continue to knead until it becomes smooth. Then, let the dough rise. Form it into a ball and place it in a large bowl greased with coconut oil. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and set it aside until the dough has doubled in size.  Next, roll out the dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and use a rolling pin to shape it into a large rectangle. Brush the dough with coconut oil and sprinkle it evenly with brown sugar and cinnamon, leaving a border around the edges.  Then, roll and cut the rolls. Starting at a short end of the rectangle, roll the dough tightly into a log. Use a sharp knife to slice the log into 12 even rolls. Place them in a large greased baking pan, cut side up. Cover the rolls and set them aside to rise for one more hour.  Finally, bake the cinnamon rolls at 350°F for 25 to 30 minutes, until they’re lightly golden brown. Remove them from the oven and allow them to cool for 10 minutes. While they cool, make the glaze. Slather it over them and enjoy warm!  Cinnamon Roll Recipe Tips Make sure your almond milk is at room temperature. Because I often make these cinnamon rolls with melted coconut oil instead of softened butter, it’s crucial that your milk is at room temperature when you’re stirring together the wet ingredients for the dough. If it’s not, the melted coconut oil will solidify. I like to measure the almond milk and pop it in the microwave for 15 seconds before mixing it with the other ingredients. Let the dough rise somewhere warm. Yeast responds to warmth, so, for an extra productive rise, stick the dough somewhere warm. We like to put ours on a sunny windowsill! I’ve also had success putting them in the oven while it’s turned off but the oven light is on. Add the glaze when the rolls are still warm, but not hot. If the rolls are too hot when you add the glaze, it will melt. If they’re too cold, it won’t spread and ooze over them. I find that letting them cool for 10 minutes brings them to the perfect temperature. They’ll still be warm when you eat them, and the frosting will soften over them without completely melting.  How to Make Overnight Cinnamon Rolls Get ahead on this cinnamon roll recipe by assembling the rolls the night before you plan to serve them. That way, you can easily bake them off in the morning! To make overnight cinnamon rolls, prepare the recipe up to the point of slicing the rolls. Place them in the baking dish and cover tightly with foil or plastic wrap. Instead of letting the rolls rise at room temperature, refrigerate them overnight. The next morning, remove the rolls from the refrigerator. Let them stand at room temperature for 1 hour before uncovering and baking them according to the recipe. Storage Tips Store these homemade cinnamon rolls in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, I recommend freezing them. How to Freeze Cinnamon Rolls Allow the cinnamon rolls to cool completely after baking. Wrap individual rolls in foil or plastic wrap, or tightly cover the entire baking dish. Store the rolls in the freezer for up to 3 months. Wrapped or covered in foil, they reheat perfectly in a 350°F oven. Add the glaze right before you eat!

2ce69d4c,https://amycakesbakes.com/take-and-bake-cinnamon-rolls/,Take and Bake Cinnamon Rolls: a Bakery Recipe,"This bakery recipe uses Instant ClearJel , a type of cornstarch that serves as both a thickener and a binder. It’s tasteless and has no artificial ingredients.  You can also use Instant Pudding mix (when it's listed in the recipe), which contains Instant Clearjel as the second ingredient! It’s often used by professional bakers because it produces a smoother and glossier consistency than cornstarch, tapioca, or other starches. Even better, it enhances moisture and texture in cakes and thickens and stabilizes frostings.  Here are a few brands I recommend: Hoosier Hill Farm Instant Clearjel on Amazon *Please make sure the clearjel you purchase is labeled as instant Instant ClearJel. Nuts.com Although it's not often available in grocery stores, it's sold in a variety of online stores--just make sure whatever you purchase is labeled as INSTANT (cooktype and original clearjel will not work the same).

Make sure it's labeled as INSTANT.  See Notes section.) 1 ½ teaspoons All-Purpose Flour ½ stick (2 ounces) Salted Butter (softened but not melted) Glaze Ingredients 141 grams (1 ¼ cups) Powdered Sugar 2 Tablespoons room temperature Water Other Ingredients ¼ stick (1 ounce) salted butter, melted ¼ cup to ½ cup flour, for dusting (only use what you need) Instructions Day One: Make Cinnamon Rolls Dough In a medium-sized bowl, whisk the Flour, Instant Clearjel, and Instant Yeast together until well blended.  Set aside. In a separate large bowl, stir the egg(s), salt, sugar, and oil together until well blended. Make sure your water is hot, around 120 degrees.  If you don't have a culinary thermometer , this temperature should feel uncomfortable to the touch but not painful).  Pour the hot water on top of the egg mixture, but don't stir it together yet.  (We want to allow our flour and instant yeast to activate when being mixed with the hot water). Immediately add the flour mixture on top of the hot water, and use a sturdy spatula to stir all of the ingredients together until a dough is formed and the ingredients are well blended.  The dough will get firmer, stickier, and more difficult to stir as it thickens. There's no kneading of this dough, as we don't want to incorporate any additional flour, but we want to stir it until it gets stretchy.  Leave the dough in the bowl, and continue to scrape the sides and stir the dough with your heavy-duty spatula for around 2-3 minutes, or until the dough is stretchy and uniform.  It will be a very sticky dough. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature until double in size, around one hour. Loosely wrap the bowl in plastic wrap, and place the risen dough in the fridge overnight, for at least 4 hours but no more than 24 hours. Day One: Prepare Filling Ingredients Stir together the brown sugar and cinnamon.  Use your fingers to break apart any large brown sugar pieces, and to make sure the cinnamon is thoroughly mixed in.   Wrap this mixture or place it in an air-tight container until Day Two. Whisk the Instant Clearjel and Flour together until well blended.  Wrap or place in an air-tight container until Day Two. If you'd like, you may take your salted butter out of the fridge so that it is softened and ready to roll in the morning. Day Two: Prepare Pan The 1 oz of melted butter for brushing will be used three times.  First, brush the foil pan(s) generously with melted butter on the bottom, sides, and inner corners.  A 1x batch makes 6 large cinnamon rolls that fit in one foil half-size steam pan . A 2x batch makes 12 large cinnamon rolls that fit in two foil half-size steam pans . Day Two: Roll Out Cinnamon Rolls Generously dust your counter with about ¼ cup of flour. Scrape the risen refrigerated cinnamon roll dough on top of the dusted flour.  Use your fingers to scrape out any stuck to the bowl and add it to the dough.  The dough will be sticky.  Avoid pressing the dough into itself or turning it into a ball--this will overwork the dough.  We want to roll it out with very little shaping of the dough.  Instead, just lightly dust any sticky portions of the dough, and press any sticky edges into the floured counter.  Lightly press the dough into a rectangular shape before rolling (I recommend watching this recipe video ). Roll out the dough into an 9 -inch horizontal by 16-inch vertical rectangle.  (A 1x batch will be tall and skinny.  A 2x batch will be wider than it is tall as seen in the recipe video).  Using extra flour only as needed, dust any parts of the dough with flour that sticks to the table or rolling pin. If your butter is firm, microwave it for a few seconds until softened but not melted.  Mix your softened butter thoroughly with the prepared Instant Clearjel mixture.  Immediately spread it onto the rolled-out dough.  We mix this right before spreading so that it doesn't have time to thicken before spreading.  Spread it evenly all the way to the very edge of the dough. Pour the prepared Brown Sugar/Cinnamon mixture on top of the butter and spread it evenly all the way to the very edge of the dough. Roll up the cinnamon dough tightly, curving the edges in slightly as you roll (watch the recipe video) .  This helps maintain a nice roll on the edges and prevents the cinnamon mixture from escaping.  When you are left with one inch of dough, pull it up and pinch it tightly against the rolled dough, creating a pinched seam. Dust the seam with flour, and turn your dough so it is seam side down against the floured counter.  Shape the roll of dough with your hands if needed so that it is even in thickness.  Score the dough with a bench scraper, pastry divider , or knife into 6 rolls, then cut the rolls with a bench scraper or sharp knife. Place the cinnamon rolls into your prepared pan, with little room between each roll and ½ inch from the edge of the pan.  Lightly press down on each roll so that the edges of each roll barely touch each other, and improve their round form if needed. (The cinnamon rolls will rise into whatever shape they are in now.  So if you have some oval or misshapen rolls, use your hands to form the edges into a circle before they rise.) Brush the cinnamon rolls with melted salted butter, then allow to rise at room temperature until double in size, around one hour. Bake the Cinnamon Rolls Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake the risen cinnamon rolls in the preheated 350-degree oven on the middle or top rack for 12  minutes, then turn the oven down to 325 degrees.  Bake for an additional 6-8 minutes or until the dough bounces back when you tap it lightly with your finger.  Check several areas of the rolls for doneness.  The inside of the cinnamon rolls should be fully baked, but the top of the cinnamon rolls should still be light or just lightly golden.  (If you are baking in a cake pan instead of a foil pan, keep in mind that glass pans and dark pans will take less time in the oven). Brush the cinnamon rolls one last time with melted butter. Freeze the Take and Bake Cinnamon Rolls When the cinnamon rolls have cooled slightly (they can still be warm), cover the pan with the foil lid (or make your own covering out of heavy duty foil).  Wrap the lidded pan thoroughly with plastic wrap, and freeze up to 3 months. Make the Cinnamon Roll Glaze You can either make the glaze right while the cinnamon rolls bake, or make it ahead and freeze it with the rolls.  Whisk the powdered sugar and water together until smooth.  When making it ahead of time, pour the prepared glaze in an 8 ounce microwave-safe container and freeze until the day before serving. Bake and Serve the Take and Bakes Thaw the prepared glaze in the fridge the night before serving.  Unwrap the cinnamon rolls (leave the foil lid on), and bake in a 325 degree oven for 40-50 minutes or until heated through. Meanwhile, heat the glaze in the microwave at 50% power, stirring regularly, until it reaches a drizzling consistency.  Drizzle the glaze over the warm cinnamon rolls and serve. Notes Notes for 2x batches (some of these won’t apply if you are using the grams measurements): 3 tsp= 1 Tbsp 4 Tbsp= ¼ cup Notes about Instant Clearjel: Read my article Instant Clearjel: a Magical Bakery Ingredient to see why I think this ingredient is worth having in your pantry.  Instant Clearjel must always be whisked thoroughly with other dry ingredients before being added to wet ingredients to avoid clumping.  (Please make sure what you purchase is labeled as “ Instant .”  Cooktype Clearjel is a different product that does not work the same in baked goods). Recipe Flavor Variations: You can also use the baking and freezing method in this recipe with my Maple Pecan Cinnamon Rolls or Mini Cinnamon Rolls or other cinnamon roll recipes . Baking from Thawed: You can also bake the Take and Bakes from thawed, however they won't be as gooey.  Thaw the cinnamon rolls and glaze in the refrigerator. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees. Remove plastic wrap (leave the foil lid on). Bake for 20-30 minutes or until heated through and lightly golden brown.

1b7c1fcd,https://litecravings.com/cinnamon-roll-baked-oats/,Cinnamon Roll Baked Oats,"I wanted to make this recipe as allergy-friendly as possible. For that reason, I omitted as much dairy as I could. You can make this completely dairy free by using a plant-based cream cheese for the frosting. This is gluten free as long as you make sure to buy gluten-free oats. I also omitted the banana that a lot of baked oats recipes include, since I know some people can be sensitive to them. Instead of cane sugar, I use maple syrup to make this naturally sweetened and still vegan. You can sub honey or brown sugar, if you prefer. Believe me, no flavor was sacrificed by making these substitutions! Here’s what you’ll need to pick up at the store to make this: Rolled Oats/Old Fashioned Oats (gluten free, if needed) Apple Sauce Almond milk (or other plant-based milk or skim milk) Maple syrup Chia Seeds (optional, but adds lots of nutrients and fiber) Cinnamon Vanilla extract Light Cream Cheese (or plant-based cream cheese)  how to make and serve Baked Oats I keep things super easy by mixing all of the ingredients together in the same dish that I bake it on. Any 8-inch dish will do, whether square or round. After you bake the oats, let them cook for a little bit while you make the frosting. If you plan to eat it right away, you can stop the oats with the frosting. But if you intend to eat it throughout the week, you might want to wait to frost each serving before you eat it. I mainly do this for easier and less messy storage, but you could just store it with the frosting on top.  And don’t feel like you have to get fancy with the swirls like I did. You can just spread the frosting on top of the baked oats in a even layer. The oats are a great base recipe for various toppings, too. So if cream cheese isn’t your thing, you can top with berries, whipped cream, nuts, maple syrup, whatever you like!  I ’d love to hear from you if you make this recipe!

24815a6e,https://www.dessertfortwo.com/quick-cinnamon-rolls-for-two/,Homemade Cinnamon Rolls (No Yeast),"Flour . All-purpose, regular flour that you fluff, scoop and level with a knife to measure. Sugar . Granulated sugar for the actual dough Baking Powder . We’re using baking powder instead of yeast for an instant rise in the dough, caused by the heat of the oven. Baking powder reacts to heat. Technically, baking powder is double-acting, which means it reacts to acidity in the dough AND reacts to heat in the oven. This will help make our rolls super tall and fluffy. Baking Soda . We need a small amount of baking soda for the perfect rise. Salt . Please don’t omit the salt; it flavors the dough so much, and balances the sweetness of the filling. Milk . I really recommend whole milk for baking. I almost always notice inferior results when using skim milk, because it lacks fat. Vinegar . It sounds strange to add vinegar, but this is extra acidity for the baking powder and baking soda to react with. Do not omit! You will not taste the vinegar. Butter . You can use unsalted or salted butter here. If you use salted butter, omit the salt in the recipe. Brown Sugar . You can use either dark or light brown sugar. Cinnamon . Ground cinnamon is the classic flavor of cinnamon rolls, but a little cardamom would be great, too! Cream Cheese . The best cinnamon rolls have a cream cheese frosting. Powdered Sugar . Also known as icing sugar, powdered sugar dissolves easily into frosting without any graininess. How to Make Quick Cinnamon Rolls Preheat the oven to 375, and spray 4 cups in a muffin pan with cooking spray (or use extra melted butter). Combine the flour, 1 tablespoon of the sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. In a small measuring cup, combine the milk, vinegar, and 2 tablespoons of the melted butter. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, and stir until a soft dough forms. Heavily flour a work surface, and pat the dough out into a rectangle about 6"" long. Use plenty of flour as you go. Pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of melted butter on top of the dough. Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, and remaining 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar. Press this mixture lightly into the butter on top of the dough. Carefully, roll the dough up starting with the long side. Roll away from you. When you get to the end of the dough, pinch the entire seam shut. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces, drop into the greased muffin cups, and bake for 14-15 minutes. Meanwhile, beat together the softened cream cheese and powdered sugar. If it seems hard to spread, splash in some milk or heavy cream. Frost the cinnamon rolls when they come out of the oven, and serve. Tips for making Homemade Cinnamon Rolls (No Yeast) Ensure your baking soda and baking powder are fresh and not expired. Go slowly and gently while you roll, and know that the muffin tin will help shape the rolls, so you don’t have to stress. Just roll them as tightly as possible. Use plenty of flour when rolling to prevent sticking. The best way to cut raw dough is with a very sharp serrated knife. It’s helpful to clean the knife between cuts. Best Frosting for this Cinnamon Rolls Recipe (Without Yeast) It’s just not a cinnamon roll unless it has fluffy cream cheese frosting. This recipe is for a small batch, since we’re only making 4 rolls. Try to find the small 3-ounce blocks of cream cheese, but if you can’t, save the remaining cream cheese for my Cheesecake Cups . What others are saying about these No Yeast Cinnamon Rolls -Tara G said 'I just made these and shared them with my roommate...they were such a joy to make and SO DELICIOUS!' -Courtney said 'I made these this weekend...(and) they were so yummy!

Ok, I've officially used throngs of women to convince you how much you need small batch cinnamon rolls for two in your life.

778d1f19,https://www.thevanillabeanblog.com/cinnamon-rolls/,Pillowy Soft Cinnamon Rolls,"Dough 4 large eggs, at room temperature 3/4 cup warm whole milk (100 to 110F [35 to 42C]) 1/4 cup [85 g] honey 4 cups [568 g] all-purpose flour 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast 2 teaspoons salt 10 tablespoons [1 1/4 sticks or 142 g] unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into 1 in [2.5 cm] pieces Filling 1/2 cup [100 g] packed brown sugar 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon Pinch salt 2 tablespoons [29 g] unsalted butter, melted and cooled Frosting 8 tablespoons [1 stick or 113 g] unsalted butter, room temperature 4 ounces [114 g] cream cheese, room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup [120 g] confectioners' sugar","For the dough Grease a large bowl. In a large liquid measuring cup, combine the eggs, milk, and honey. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, mix the flour, yeast, and salt and stir on low to combine. Add the egg mixture and mix on low to combine. With the mixer on low, add the butter, one piece at a time. When all the butter has been added, increase the speed to medium and beat the butter into the dough, until all the little butter pieces are incorporated, 1 minute. Transfer the dough to the prepared bowl. The dough will be very sticky and you will need a spatula to scrape the dough into the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes. Place your fingers or a spatula underneath the dough and gently pull the dough up and fold it back over itself. Turn the bowl and repeat this folding again. Continue 6 to 8 more times, until all the dough has been folded over on itself. Re-cover the bowl with plastic and let rise for 30 minutes. Repeat this series of folding 3 more times, for a rise time of 2 hours and a total of 4 foldings (see the GIF above on how to do this folding). Tightly cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or up to 72 hours. To Assemble Flour a work surface and knead the cold Sweet Dough 10 to 12 times (see troubleshooting above for why). Shape the dough into a ball, cover the top lightly with flour, and cover with a tea towel and let come to room temperature. Grease a 9 by 13 in [23 by 33 cm] pan; if desired, line with parchment paper (this makes for easier cleanup). In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Roll the dough into a 16 by 12 in [30.5 by 40.5 cm] rectangle. Brush the dough with the melted butter and sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the top, pressing it lightly into the butter so it adheres. Starting at a long side, roll the dough into a tight cylinder. Pinch the seam gently to seal it and position the dough seam side down. Use scissors or a sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 equal pieces. Transfer the pieces to the prepared pan and place them cut side up. Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap and let the dough rise until doubled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position. Preheat the oven to 350F [180C]. Remove the plastic and bake 27 to 32 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through, until the rolls are golden brown. While the rolls are baking, prepare the icing. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Using an offset spatula or table knife, apply a thin layer of the cream cheese icing, using about one-third of the mixture. Let the rolls cool for another 15 to 20 minutes. Top with the rest of the icing and serve. For the icing In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the butter and cream cheese on medium until smooth and creamy. Add the vanilla and salt and mix on low to combine. Add the confectioners' sugar and mix on low until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix on medium until the icing is light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. **For overnight cinnamon rolls Prepare the rolls (roll out dough, fill them, roll them up, cut them, and put them in the prepared pan, but do not let rise for 1 1/2 hours as stated above) then cover them loosely with plastic and refrigerate for up to 18 hours. When ready to bake, preheat the oven, and let the rolls sit at room temperature (still covered in plastic) for 30-45 minutes.

Knead the levain until it forms a cohesive ball. Set in a liquid measuring cup and cover for 12 hours until the levain has doubled in size and the top is rounded. Sourdough Cinnamon Rolls Warm the milk in the microwave (about 1 1/2 minutes full power) or on the stove. It should be around 90-100 degrees F, no warmer than that. To the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook, add the ripe levain, warmed milk and melted butter. Add the sugar, eggs, salt and most of the bread flour. Turn on the dough hook and knead for a few minutes. Add the remainder of the bread flour as needed. The dough should be tacky, not overly sticky and should all cling to one side of the bowl ( or away from the edges depending on your mixer) . Knead for a total of 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth. Bulk Fermentation: Put the dough in a container and cover . Set the dough in a warm, 78-80 degree F place for 4 hours. Take the temperature of the dough as needed to make sure the dough temperature stays right around 78 degrees F. This temperature is the optimal fermentation. At the end of about 4 hours, the dough should be puffed up and feel very elastic. If it doesn't feel this way, let it bulk ferment for another half hour and check again. Overnight Refrigeration: At this point, after the bulk fermentation has finished, cover the dough and put it in the refrigerator. Proceed with the recipe the next day, shaping and proofing the rolls before baking. This allows you to time the cinnamon rolls for breakfast or brunch if desired. If you prefer to shape the rolls and bake them the same day, skip the overnight refrigeration and proceed with the recipe. Mix up the Filling : Near the end of bulk fermentation, mix up the cinnamon roll filling. To a small bowl, add the melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and flour. Mix together. Set aside. Shaping: Line a half sheet pan (18 by 13 inches) with parchment paper. Roll the dough out into an approximate 18 by 12 rectangle. Spread the cinnamon filling all over the dough with your fingers, making sure to cover up to the edges of the cinnamon roll. Starting with the dough closest to you, roll up the cinnamon roll and pinch together the seam. Flip the cinnamon roll over, seam side down. Cut the long log of cinnamon roll dough into 12 equal pieces. Place the cinnamon rolls on the parchment paper, snuggling all 12 rolls together on the pan. Proofing: Cover the pan and let rise in a 78 degree F place until puffed up and risen, about 3 hours. Do not bake these rolls if they have not risen. Baking: Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake for about 22-25 minutes until baked all the way through. Cream Cheese Frosting: Using a hand mixer, whip together softened butter and cream cheese. Add the powdered sugar, heavy whipping cream, vanilla extract, maple extract and salt. Whip together for 2-3 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. The frosting should be light and fluffy. Spread frosting over the tops of the cinnamon rolls while they are still warm.

Pour in the scalded milk and mix. Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes or so until it is warm but not blazing hot. Add the 4 cups flour and sprinkle the yeast on top of the flour. Mix until no dry streaks remain and scrape down the sides of the bowl if needed. The dough will be loose and wet-looking. Cover the bowl and let the sponge rest until puffy and doubled, 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the warmth of your kitchen. Add the remaining 3/4 cup flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Mix until the flour is completely incorporated and the dough looks smooth instead of rough and shaggy. It may not necessarily clean the sides of the bowl but it should for a pretty cohesive mass. Add additional flour only if it is too sticky to handle or a small piece of dough won’t form a ball in your hands (it’s ok if it leaves some doughy residue on your fingers). Scrape the dough into a lightly greased bowl or container, cover, and let rise until doubled, about an hour. On a lightly floured counter (I use about 2-3 tablespoons flour), roll or pat the dough into about a 18X12-inch rectangle. Spread the softened butter evenly across the top. Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon (and cardamom, if using) in a bowl and sprinkle evenly across the top of the butter. Pat down very lightly. Starting with one long end, start rolling the rectangle into a log without pulling and stretching on the dough (but still rolling as tightly as possible). Roll the seam to the bottom and pat the log into an even thickness – it should be about 20 inches long or so at this point. Cut the log into 12 even pieces. Place the rolls on a parchment-lined half sheet pan, tucking the loose end of the roll underneath, if you want. The rolls should be about an inch apart so they have room to rise. Cover with lightly greased plastic wrap and let rise until noticeably puffy and almost doubled, about an hour. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-25 minutes until lightly golden and baked through. Let cool until warm before frosting. For the frosting, add the cream cheese and butter to a medium bowl. Whip with a handheld (or stand) mixer until creamy. Add the salt, milk or cream, and vanilla. Mix again. Add the powdered sugar and whip until light and creamy. Spread the slightly warm rolls evenly with the icing.

96bafbaa,https://www.mybakingaddiction.com/cinnamon-rolls-with-heavy-cream/,Cinnamon Rolls with Heavy Cream (TikTok Cinnamon Rolls),"To make this recipe, you will need: A bag of Rhodes Thaw, Rise and Bake Cinnamon Rolls: These are also sometimes labeled as “Bake ‘N Serv” cinnamon rolls. The Rhodes brand rolls are pretty widely available, but other brands should work fine if you can’t find Rhodes. Heavy whipping cream: This will get poured directly over the thawed rolls before baking. Salted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon & vanilla: These will get mixed together to go on top of the cinnamon rolls before baking. The frosting that comes with the cinnamon rolls: The cream cheese frosting that came with the rolls won’t go to waste – we’ll use that after the cinnamon rolls are baked! If you want to really take these cinnamon rolls with heavy cream up a notch, you can use a homemade frosting instead. I would recommend using the cream cheese frosting from my pumpkin spice cinnamon rolls .  Making this recipe You can make these cinnamon rolls all on the same day or start them the night before. Place all 12 of the frozen cinnamon rolls in a greased 13×9-inch baking pan and cover the pan with plastic wrap. Let the rolls thaw overnight in the refrigerator (for 8-16 hours) or on the counter for 3-5 hours. Once the rolls have thawed and doubled in size, pour the heavy cream directly onto the rolls. Let this rest for 5 minutes. While the rolls rest, whisk together the butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla. Pour this over the tops of the rolls. Use a spatula to spread it out evenly. Bake the rolls for 30-35 minutes or until the cinnamon rolls are golden brown. Let them cool for about 10 minutes before topping with the cream cheese frosting and serving.  Using Pillsbury cinnamon rolls instead of frozen cinnamon rolls Like I said, I’ve made both versions of these cinnamon rolls with heavy cream. While our family prefers the frozen cinnamon rolls version because we think they taste more like homemade cinnamon rolls, I’ll definitely make the Pillsbury version again in a pinch! It’s a great way to really elevate a can of cinnamon rolls. To make the Pillsbury version, grab two 8-count cans of Pillsbury Grands Original Cinnamon Rolls. Place the rolls in the greased baking dish, cover with the heavy cream, and continue with the recipe as written. Since you don’t have to factor in the thawing and rising time, this version is much faster to make!  STORAGE AND REHEATING Store any leftover cinnamon rolls with heavy cream covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. These cinnamon rolls are best when they’re warm, so I recommend reheating leftovers. Place a cinnamon roll on a microwave-safe plate and microwave for 30-60 seconds before eating.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix together the flour, cornstarch, sugar and salt on low speed until combined. With the mixer still on low speed, add the warm milk mixture in a steady stream and mix until the dough comes together, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium and add the butter, one piece at a time, until totally incorporated. Continue to mix until the dough is smooth and comes away from the sides of the bowl, about 10 minutes. If after mixing for 10 minutes the dough is still wet and sticky, add up to another 4 tablespoons of flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. (Be patient with this, as mine took nearly the entire 10 minutes to clear the sides of the bowl and I did not need additional flour.) Turn the dough onto a clean surface and knead briefly to form a round, smooth ball. Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place in a warm, draft-free area and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Make the Filling: In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into an 18-inch square. Using an offset spatula, spread the softened butter over the surface of the dough, leaving a ½-inch border around the edges. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly over top, then sprinkle the chopped apple and drizzle with the caramel sauce. Beginning with the edge nearest you, roll the dough into a tight cylinder and pinch the seams closed. Using a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut the roll into 12 even pieces. Place the pieces cut-side-up in a greased 9×13-inch baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm, draft-free area until doubled in size, about 1 hour. (MAKE AHEAD: After placing the rolls in the pan and covering with plastic wrap, you can place the pan in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 24 hours. When ready to bake, remove from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour before proceeding with the next step.) Bake the Cinnamon Rolls: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the plastic wrap and bake until the cinnamon rolls are a deep golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool while you prepare the icing. Make the Salted Caramel Icing: In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, heavy cream and salted caramel sauce until smooth.

Roll up dough into one long roll. Cut rolls, using a piece of dental floss or thread, about two inches thick. Place rolls in greased 9X13-inch baking pans, leaving about 2-inches between the rolls so they have room to rise. Now follow the exact same steps with the other half of the dough.

a4334b34,https://theloopywhisk.com/2023/02/04/gluten-free-cinnamon-rolls/,The Softest Gluten Free Cinnamon Rolls,"The key to beautiful gluten free cinnamon rolls lies in kneading the dough until it’s completely smooth – in fact, it’s best to knead the dough for an additional 5 minutes with the stand mixer (or about 8-10 minutes if doing it by hand) after all the ingredients have been thoroughly incorporated. Side note: baking powder in cinnamon rolls??? In the recipe below, you’ll notice a slightly unusual ingredient: baking powder. Typically, cinnamon rolls don’t contain baking powder – instead, they rely entirely on yeast for their fluffy, soft texture and open crumb. However, we’re in the realm of gluten free baking and, sometimes, in order to achieve a texture that’s virtually indistinguishable from that of a “regular” wheat-based equivalent… well, we need to “cheat” a bit. That’s where the baking powder comes in. The baking powder helps to make the gluten free cinnamon rolls even fluffier and softer, and therefore closer in texture to their “regular” equivalents made with wheat flour. It’s a small trick – but it makes a huge difference.  Rolling & shaping the gluten free cinnamon rolls I use the cut-then-roll method to shape cinnamon rolls, which is slightly different from the norm, but it works perfectly. It’s my go-to method when shaping cinnamon rolls made from gluten free dough, which tends to be somewhat more delicate than its gluten-containing equivalent. I find this much easier and more convenient than rolling up the dough into a long log and then cutting the rolls with a knife or even with baker’s thread (or floss). Here’s how to get gluten free cinnamon rolls with the perfect swirl (this recipe makes 7 cinnamon rolls): On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a roughly 11×15-inch (28x38cm) rectangle. Dollop on the cinnamon-sugar filling (made by mixing together light brown sugar, ground cinnamon and very soft butter). Spread it out into an even layer across the rolled-out dough. Make sure that the filling goes all the way to the edges. Cut the rectangle lengthways into seven 1½-inch (4cm) wide strips, so that they’re 15 inches (38cm) long. Roll up each individual strip into a roll – this will give you the perfect swirl. Then, transfer them into a buttered 10-inch (25cm) skillet or round baking pan. ( Here’s the skillet I used – it’s a real beauty, it bakes super evenly and, importantly, it’s a total breeze to clean.)   Proof until doubled in size You need to proof the cinnamon rolls in a warm place for about 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes or until about doubled in volume. Lightly cover them with a sheet of plastic wrap/cling film to prevent them from drying out. If your kitchen is on the cold side, you can proof them in a lukewarm oven – the ideal proofing temperature is around 79ºF/26ºC. I usually place a cup of hot water on the bottom of the oven to maintain a fairly humid proofing environment. As you can see below, the rolls initially only just touch each other. However, after proofing (as they double in volume), they will sit snuggled quite closely together.  Pour over heavy/double cream Once your rolls have doubled in size, pour warm heavy/double cream evenly all over the cinnamon rolls . The recipe uses quite a lot of cream (100g or about ⅓ cup + 2 tablespoons) but it will all get absorbed by the cinnamon rolls to make them extra rich and perfectly gooey – and a part of it also contributes to the slightly “sticky” caramel-y sauce on the bottom of the pan, which makes the whole thing even more delicious. It’s important that you use warm cream (not cold straight from the fridge). This will ensure that the cinnamon rolls stay nicely warm and cosy as they enter the oven, so they’ll continue to rise and expand – which is the key to getting them beautifully soft and squishy.  This idea of pouring cream over cinnamon rolls was around before TikTok, but it was definitely popularised through the platform, starting with @manthacancook and @mississippi_kween , and then it spread like crazy until it seemed like EVERYONE was making cream-drenched cinnamon rolls. I’m late to the game, I know – but better late than never, right? Baking the gluten free cinnamon rolls You need to bake the cinnamon rolls at 350ºF/180ºC for a total of about 35 minutes . For the first 20 minutes, keep the cinnamon rolls loosely covered with a sheet of aluminium foil. You don’t need to cover them super tightly, just enough so that most of the steam gets trapped by the foil. But arrange it so that it’s fairly easy to remove later on, without having to necessarily remove the skillet or pan from the oven, if at all possible. As mentioned above, the aluminium foil traps the steam generated by the cinnamon rolls themselves and by the cream. This prevents a crust from forming on top of the cinnamon rolls, which means that they can expand much more during this first part of baking, so they’ll end up even softer and squishier.  After the 20 minutes, remove the aluminium foil and continue baking until the cinnamon rolls get golden on top – about 15 minutes more. Now, if you’re at all familiar with the viral TikTok cinnamon rolls hack, then you’ll know that when baking regular cinnamon rolls made with wheat flour, many people keep the rolls covered with aluminium foil throughout the baking and uncover them only when they’re completely done. I don’t really recommend this with gluten free cinnamon rolls, as they do need to lose some moisture during baking, otherwise they could end up a bit too moist and/or stodgy. Plus, that little bit of caramelisation and browning on top also adds flavour.  When your cinnamon rolls come out of the oven, they probably won’t look super neat and pretty. Mine never do – the cinnamon filling bubbles out and partially covers the swirls, so they look a bit all over the place. But trust me when I say that they’ll end up looking absolutely STUNNING… and tasting even better. The cream cheese icing The cream cheese icing is a simple combination of room temperature cream cheese, softened butter, powdered/icing sugar, vanilla bean paste and a pinch of salt. Just whisk it all together until smooth, and it’s ready. It’s important to use room temperature cream cheese, otherwise the butter will seize up and you’ll end with lumpy icing. You can use vanilla extract if you don’t have vanilla bean paste – but the paste will give you a more intense flavour, as well as all those lovely specks of vanilla.  It’s best to put the icing on the cinnamon rolls while they’re still VERY warm (almost hot). I usually allow the cinnamon rolls to cool for only about 5-10 minutes before putting on the icing. The warmth/heat from the cinnamon rolls will cause the icing to partially melt into all the nooks and crannies, and it will make the cinnamon rolls even more decadent and luxurious. You can be as generous with the icing as you want. You can absolutely smother the rolls in icing by using all of it, or you can use about three quarters of it and save the rest for anyone who wants an extra dollop of icing on top of their cinnamon roll as you’re serving them. There’s no rules here – just very, very delicious cinnamon rolls.   Overnight option: preparing the gluten free cinnamon rolls ahead of time You can easily prepare these gluten free cinnamon rolls ahead of time. You have two options, and both work really well: Prepare the dough and then keep it in the fridge overnight (in a closed container or in a covered bowl). You can then roll, shape, proof and bake the cinnamon rolls the next day. Alternatively, you can make the dough and shape the cinnamon rolls, and then keep the tightly covered skillet or baking pan in the fridge overnight. The next day, bring the rolls to room temperature. If they haven’t doubled in size by the time they’ve reached room temperature, proof them for a while longer – and then, pour over the heavy/double cream and bake according to the recipe. Note that I don’t recommend keeping the dough in the fridge for longer than one day. How to store & reheat homemade gluten free cinnamon rolls Now, because these are gluten free, you might think that they would be rock-hard and dry about an hour or two after baking – but that’s not the case AT ALL!!! They actually stay soft and fluffy even after they’ve cooled down complately, although I definitely recommend enjoying them while they’re warm. They’re definitely at their very best on the day of baking, but you can keep them in a closed air-tight container for 2-3 days. Then, just before serving, re-heat them briefly in the microwave for 15-20 seconds. This will return them to their original pillowy softness. Possible substitutions Although all the ingredients in the recipe should be easily accessible either in your local grocery store or online, I still wanted to include a list of substitutions you can make. (NOTE: all substitutions should be made by weight and not by volume.) Instant yeast: You can use active dry yeast instead, in which case you’ll have to activate it first. Use the warm milk and 1-2 tablespoons of the sugar listed in the recipe to activate it – just mix them all together and allow the mixture to sit for 5-10 minutes or until it starts frothing and bubbling. Then, add it to the dry ingredients along with the psyllium gel, egg and melted butter. Psyllium husk: YOU CAN’T SUBSTITUTE IT WITH A DIFFERENT INGREDIENT. But if you use psyllium husk powder as opposed to the whole psyllium husk, use only 85% of the weight listed in the recipe. Tapioca starch: You can use an equal weight of cornstarch (US)/cornflour (UK), potato starch or arrowroot starch instead. Millet flour: You can use an equal weight of finely ground/milled brown rice flour instead, but your cinnamon rolls might be slightly less fluffy. Sorghum flour: You can use an equal weight of white teff flour, light buckwheat flour or oat flour instead (the latter only if you’re not sensitive to oats). A note on measurements (tl;dr: if possible, use a scale) While I’ve included the volume measurements (cups and spoons) in the recipe card below, if at all possible (and I really cannot overemphasise this): USE METRIC GRAM MEASUREMENTS IF YOU CAN. They’re much more precise and produce more reliably delicious results. This is true for pretty much all of baking – a kitchen scale will invariably give better results than cups and tablespoons.  And there you have it: this covers just about everything you need to know in order to make truly THE BEST gluten free cinnamon rolls. I’ve actually tested this recipe more times than was *strictly* necessary because these are soooo good and I just can’t get enough of them. I really hope you’ll love them as much as I do.

Use the latter only if you're not sensitive to oats.) ▢ 50 g (¼ cup) caster/superfine or granulated sugar ▢ 6 g (2 tsp) instant yeast (If using active dry yeast, use 8g.) ▢ 6 g (1½ tsp) baking powder ▢ 5 g (2 tsp) xanthan gum ▢ 5 g (1 tsp) salt ▢ 100 g (⅓ cup + 1½ tbsp) whole milk, warm ▢ 1 US large/UK medium egg, room temperature ▢ 35 g (2½ tbsp) unsalted butter, melted Cinnamon filling: ▢ 85 g (¾ stick) very soft unsalted butter (The ideal butter texture is somewhere in between softened and melted butter – it should be quite soft and easily spreadable, but not completely liquid.) ▢ 100 g (½ cup) light brown sugar ▢ 1 tbsp ground cinnamon For baking the cinnamon rolls: ▢ ½ tbsp unsalted butter, softened, for buttering the skillet or baking pan ▢ 100 g (⅓ cup + 2 tbsp) heavy/double cream, warm Cream cheese icing: ▢ 115 g (½ cup) full-fat cream cheese, room temperature ▢ 55 g (½ stick) unsalted butter, softened ▢ 90 g (¾ cup) powdered/icing sugar ▢ ½-1 tsp vanilla bean paste (or 1-2 tsp vanilla extract) ▢ pinch of salt Instructions Gluten free enriched dough: To make the dough, I recommend using a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. You can also make the dough by hand, but the mixer makes it much easier and results in a smoother dough. Make the psyllium gel: In a bowl, mix together the psyllium husk and warm water. After about 30-45 seconds, a gel will form. In the bowl of the stand mixer, whisk together the tapioca starch, millet flour, sorghum flour, sugar, instant yeast, baking powder, xanthan gum and salt. Tip: If using active dry yeast instead, you need to activate it first. Mix together the active dry yeast, 1-2 tbsp of the sugar and the warm milk. Set aside for 10-15 minutes, or until the mixture starts frothing. Then, add it to the dry ingredients along with the psyllium gel, egg and melted butter. Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and add the psyllium gel, warm milk, egg and melted butter. Knead the dough until smooth and all the ingredients are evenly incorporated, then knead for a further 5 minutes (if using a stand mixer) or 8-10 minutes (if kneading it by hand). Use a rubber spatula to occasionally scrape along the sides and bottom of the bowl to prevent any dry patches of unmixed flour. Tip: This extra kneading time will make the dough EXTRA smooth, which is the key to beautiful gluten free cinnamon rolls. The final dough will be slightly sticky to the touch – that’s okay, you’ll be working on a lightly floured surface so it shouldn’t be a problem. Resist the temptation to add more flour to the dough, as that can make the final rolls too dense and dry. Tip: If you find the dough too sticky to easily handle (even on a floured surface and with floured hands), you can chill it in the fridge for about 1 hour before proceeding to the next step. This will give the flours in the dough time to properly hydrate and also firm up the butter in the dough – both of these factors will make the dough firmer, less sticky, and therefore easier to handle. Cinnamon filling: In a bowl, mix together the very soft butter, light brown sugar and ground cinnamon until you get a soft, spreadable paste. Tip: If it's too thick to spread easily, you can soften it slightly in the microwave (in 2-3 second bursts, mix in between). If it's too runny, you can chill it briefly in the fridge until it thickens to the right consistency. Set aside until needed. Assembling the cinnamon rolls: Lightly butter a 10-inch (25cm) skillet or round baking pan, and set aside until needed. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a ball. Roll it out into a roughly 11×15-inch (28x38cm) rectangle. Dollop on the cinnamon filling and spread it out into an even layer across the rolled-out dough, all the way to the edges. Cut the rectangle lengthways into seven 1½-inch (4cm) wide strips, so that they’re 15 inches (38cm) long. I like to use a pizza cutter for this, but a sharp knife will also work well. Roll up each individual strip into a roll – this will give you the perfect swirl. Arrange the cinnamon rolls in the buttered skillet or baking pan, they should only just touch each other. Proofing the cinnamon rolls: Proof the cinnamon rolls in a warm place for about 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes or until about doubled in volume. Lightly cover them with a sheet of plastic wrap/cling film to prevent them from drying out during proofing. Tip: If your kitchen is on the cold side, you can proof them in a lukewarm oven (the ideal proofing temperature is around 79ºF/26ºC). I usually place a cup of hot water inside the oven, to maintain a fairly humid environment. Baking the cinnamon rolls: While the rolls are proofing, adjust the oven rack to the middle position and pre-heat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC). Once the cinnamon rolls have doubled in volume, pour warm heavy/double cream evenly all over them. Tip: The addition of cream makes these gluten free cinnamon rolls extra rich and soft. It’s important that you use warm cream (not cold from the fridge). Cover the skillet or baking pan with a sheet of aluminium foil. Tip: You don’t need to cover it super tightly, just enough so that most of the steam generated during baking will get trapped by the foil. But arrange it so that it’s fairly easy to remove later on, without having to necessarily remove the skillet or pan from the oven, if at all possible. Bake the cinnamon rolls at 350ºF (180ºC) covered with the aluminium foil for 20 minutes. Tip: The aluminium foil traps the steam generated during baking, which prevents a crust from forming on top of the cinnamon rolls. This allows them to expand much more during this first part of baking, so they’ll end up even softer and squishier. After the 20 minutes, remove the aluminium foil and continue baking until the cinnamon rolls get golden on top – about 15 minutes more. Allow the baked cinnamon rolls to cool for 5-10 minutes while you prepare the cream cheese icing. Cream cheese icing: In a bowl, whisk together the cream cheese and butter until smooth. (You can do this by hand with a balloon whisk, with a hand mixer fitted with the double beaters, or with a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.) Add the powdered sugar, vanilla and salt, and whisk well until evenly combined, smooth and creamy. Spread the cream cheese icing over the cinnamon rolls while they're still hot or very warm . You can use all of the icing, or spread just ¾ of it over the rolls and set the rest aside for anyone who wants extra with their cinnamon roll. Tip: The warmth/heat from the cinnamon rolls will cause the icing to partially melt into all the nooks and crannies, and it will make the cinnamon rolls even more decadent and luxurious. Enjoy the cinnamon rolls while they're still warm. Serving and storage: These gluten free cinnamon rolls are best served while they’re warm. They're at their best on the day of baking, but you can keep them in a closed container for about 2-3 days. Just before serving, re-heat them briefly in the microwave for 15-20 seconds. This will return them to their original pillowy softness. Overnight, make-ahead options: Option 1: You can prepare the dough and then keep it in the fridge overnight (in a closed container or in a covered bowl). You can then roll, shape, proof and bake the cinnamon rolls the next day. Option 2: You can make the dough and shape the cinnamon rolls, and then keep the tightly covered skillet or baking pan in the fridge overnight. The next day, bring the rolls to room temperature. If they haven’t doubled in size by the time they’ve reached room temperature, proof them for a while longer – and then, pour over the heavy/double cream and bake according to the recipe.

Grease a 22x33 cm (13x9 inch) pan with softened butter. In a bowl of a stand mixer sift together flour, salt and sugar. Set aside while you prepare the rest. If you're using active dry yeast (like me), you need to activate it first. Heat your milk and water over a medium heat until it reaches about 50°C. Put active dry yeast in a small bowl and cover with couple of tablespoons of that warm milk and water mixture and a teaspoon of sugar. Mix it with a teaspoon and leave it to rest for 5 minutes or until it becomes all frothy and bubbly on top. While your yeast is activating, heat up your milk and water mixture just a bit more and then pour it over cubed unsalted butter in order to melt it. Let it cool down - this mixture shouldn't be over 50-55C , otherwise it might kill the yeast. Once you got everything ready, pour your yeast and milk/water/butter mixture to the flour. Add an egg. Using your stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, knead it on low speed for about 10 minutes or until it starts pulling from the sides. You may want to turn the mixer down once or twice and scrape the bottom with a spatula to make sure everything combines well. The dough should be a little sticky, that's fine. When you're done with the stand mixer, transfer the douhgh to a lightly floured surface and knead it for just a couple of minutes. Transfer it to a greased bowl and let it rest fo 15-20 minutes, covered with cling film, while you prepare the filling. It doesn't need to double in size or anything. For the filling - mix together softened butter, light muscovado sugar and cinnamon. If your sugar is lumpy, make sure to sift it before. Mix everything with a spatula, until smooth and combined. After 15-20 minutes, using a floured rolling pin - roll the dough on a lightly floured surfaced to around 40x30 cm rectangle. (17x12 inch) Using an offset palette knife, spread the filling evenly, making sure you're not damaging the dough. Roll the dough on the long side to a log. Cut about a centimeter from each end to get neat edges. Then divide the log into 12 pieces using a sharp knife (you don't want to smush everything) Place cinnamon rolls in a prepared pan leaving quite a bit of space so they can rise properly. I actually used a too small of a pan, it would be better if I put only 9 of them in there, but it turned out okay anyway. 🙂 Cover your rolls with a clean tea towel or cling film and leave them to rise in a warm place, until double in size ( approx. 45 minutes). You'll know the dough is perfectly risen if  it leaves a small indent when you press your finger. Bake them for about 25 minutes in a preheated oven. Once they're done, leave them to cool a little bit before glazing. for the vanilla bean cream cheese glaze Make sure all your ingredients are ROOM TEMPERATURE.

Stir in the yeast and let it sit for a few minutes to dissolve. Into a stand mixer with knead attachment, add the milk mixture, eggs, incorporate them in well. Stir in the butter, potato flesh, salt and sugar to combine. Add 4 1/4 cups of the flour, 1 cup at a time, reserve the last 1/4 cup for rolling them out. Work everything together to combine for a minute, then dump the dough on a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough by pushing it with the heels of your hands and pulling it back to you on repeat for about 5 minutes. Roll it into a smooth little dough baby, cover it with a dish towel or plastic wrap and let it rise until it doubles in size. This time of year, since it’s a little chillier, this will take no less than an hour, likely two. Go do something else and just leave it alone. While you’re waiting, stir the brown sugar, cinnamon and butter together. It should look like a thick paste. Roll the dough out into a 1/4” thick rectangle, about 14” in length. No need to bust out a ruler, just guess. Spread the brown sugar butter mixture all across the top. Sprinkle pecan or walnut pieces in there if you like nuts. Starting with the long side, roll the dough down into a log. Cut the log into roughly 3” thick pieces (you can make them smaller or larger to your preference). Arrange them with an inch of space between in one or two greased baking dishes. I don’t need 14 rolls for just my family, so I bake half in a 10” cast iron skillet and put the rest in a second baking dish to gift). (This much can be done a day in advance and leave them covered in the fridge. Whomever wakes up first in the morning, should pull them from the fridge so they can rest and rise for at least one hour before baking. You can also freeze them, and pull them out to the counter when you go to bed the evening prior to wanting to bake them) Cover the rolls loosely with a dish towel and let them rise another hour. Preheat the oven to 350°. Bake the rolls on the middle rack for 20 minutes. While the rolls bake, whip up your frosting.

STEP ONE: Make your dough To start, bloom your yeast. Mix your active dry yeast, little bit of sugar, and warm milk together and let sit for 10 minutes until foamy on top. bloomed yeast Next, in a large bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, mix flour, salt and sugar together. To the dry ingredients add the whisked eggs, vanilla, and softened butter and mix. Add in the yeast mixture and mix until everything is blended. Switch to a dough hook and knead on medium speed for 7-10 minutes until the dough pulls away from the edges of the bowl, forms a ball and springs back when pressed.  ""blended"" dough STEP TWO: Let it rise. Form the dough into a ball. Place the dough in a large, greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap or kitchen towel and place in a warm place to rise, (outside or a cold oven with the light on works well for this), for 1- 1 ½ hours, or until the dough doubles in size. kneaded dough proofed dough STEP THREE: Make the gooey cinnamon caramel. While the dough rises, make the sticky caramel sauce for the bottoms of the rolls, by mixing the butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, honey, vanilla, heavy cream and salt together in a medium bowl. Grease a 9x13 inch casserole dish. Spread the mixture evenly over the bottom of the pan.  STEP FOUR: Make your filling. While the dough rises, also make the filling by mixing butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt together in a small bowl. If the filling is too firm and not spreadable, add heavy cream a teaspoon at a time until it's easily spreadable.  STEP FIVE: Roll out your dough and spread filling. Once the dough has had a chance to rise, remove from bowl, punch dough to release the air, and roll out on a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough into about an 18 x 12 inch rectangle. It should be about ¼ inch thick. Next, sprinkle the cinnamon sugar filling over the dough and spread it evenly with an offset spatula. STEP SIX: Roll up dough and cut rolls. Roll up the dough tightly into a long log shape starting from the end closest to you. Cut of a bit off the ends to make the log even. Cut 12 rolls about 1 ½ inches wide using unflavored floss, kitchen twine or a very sharp knife.  STEP SEVEN: Let the rolls proof. Place the rolls in the prepared casserole dish with the cinnamon caramel sauce mixture and pour room temperature heavy cream in between each roll. Cover them with plastic wrap and let them proof in a warm spot for about an hour, or until they have doubled in size.  STEP EIGHT: Bake the rolls and make the cream cheese icing. Once the rolls have completed their second rise, bake at 350 degrees F for 29-32 minutes until golden brown. Cover with aluminum foil for the last 5 minutes if they're getting too brown. While they bake, make the cream cheese frosting by adding the softened butter to a medium bowl and mixing on high speed with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy. Add in the cream cheese and mix until combined on medium speed. Sift the powdered sugar into the mixture a little at a time until all is combined. Then add in the vanilla and combine on medium speed until the frosting is smooth. Let the rolls cool for 10 minutes, then cover the warm rolls with the cream cheese icing. Then serve!  FAQs Why didn't my dough rise? Check that your yeast is not expired. If it did not get very foamy on top and smell ""yeasty"" after it bloomed, the yeast is dead. I've found that if it is just bubbly on top, but not foamy, this is an indication that the yeast is dead. Secondly, perhaps the dough just needed more time. Some times it can take up to 1 ½ hours for the dough to proof all the way to ""doubled in size"". Can the dough be prepared the day before? Yes. To prepare ahead of time follow recipe up until you are about to proof the buns for the second time. Cover the prepared buns and place in the fridge. The next morning when ready to bake, take the buns out of the fridge, pour room temperature cream in between them and allow them to proof somewhere warm until they've doubled in size. Keep in mind it will take longer than an hour because the dough is cold and has to come all the way to room temperature and then proof. Once they've doubled in size, bake according to the recipe. How do I store the rolls? Keep left over cinnamon rolls in an airtight container for up to three days, but I have a feeling they'll be gone before that!  Pro Tips Lightly grease plastic wrap for covering the dough while it proofs. This will help it not to stick to the rolls. Use unflavored dental floss to cut the dough into rolls. This will allow for really pretty, clean cuts that a knife really can't give you. Let your dough proof outside if it's warm enough, or in a cold oven with the light on.
