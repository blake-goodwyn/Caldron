The butter might not mix in all the way and stay in little bits, but that’s okay.', 'Gradually Add Flour:Lower the mixer speed and slowly add all-purpose flour, one cup at a time. Make sure each cup mixes in before adding the next one. Sometimes, stop to scrape the sides of the bowl to ensure everything mixes evenly.

Alternatively, you can knead it by hand on a lightly floured surface for the same amount of time. If the dough gets too sticky while kneading, add 1 teaspoon of flour at a time until it becomes soft and a bit tacky. Be careful not to add too much flour; you don’t want the dough to become dry.

If it does, let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. This will make it easier to roll out.', 'Prepare the Filling:Spread melted butter evenly over the dough. In a small bowl, mix sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle this mixture evenly over the butter. Roll up the dough tightly into an 18-inch-long log.

With the dough hook attachment in place, slowly mix in the flour and salt and mix until just combined. The dough should look rather wet. Put a towel over the bowl and let sit for 10 minutes. After the dough has rested it’s time to incorporate the butter. This takes about 6-8 minutes. Turn on the mixer to stir and add in 1 tablespoon of butter at a time waiting for the last pad of butter to be completely incorporated before adding the next.Bulk FermentationOnce all the butter is incorporated, transfer your dough to a clean bowl or container, covered, and let the dough ferment. To strengthen the dough, just like you would a regular loaf, you’ll do a series of stretches and pulls every thirty minutes for a total of four over a two-hour period.Chill the DoughThis dough is rather sticky so you’ll want to chill it properly before rolling it out. Chill the dough for at least two hours or as long as overnight (I often make this dough during the day and roll it out the next morning for midday rolls).Prep the Cinnamon Sugar MixtureIn a small bowl, mix together all the cinnamon sugar ingredients until incorporated.Roll Out the Dough/Prepping the RollsGenerously flour your work surface, pull your dough from the fridge, and lightly flour the top of your dough. With a rolling pin, roll out the dough to a rectangle about 12×18 wide – I use this as a loose guide it doesn’t have to be exact. You’ll want to work quickly because as the dough comes to room temp, it will get very sticky.Spread the cinnamon sugar mixture all over the dough.

Cut the log into rolls about 1.5in thick. I like to give them a quick score to try to get twelve even rolls before I make the full cuts.Proof the RollsNext, transfer the rolls to the prepared baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to proof for about 2 hours. Two hours is a guide, it may take longer. You’ll know the rolls are ready when they’ve puffed up not quite doubled. They’ll rise even more during the bake.Bake the RollsPreheat the oven to 400°. Bake the rolls in a preheated 400° oven for 20-25 minutes until they are golden brown and delicious looking.Mix the Cream Cheese FrostingWhile the rolls are in the oven mix together the cream cheese icing.

Make sure to use a thermometer! Then gently stir in yeast and a teaspoon of sugar and let it sit and get foamy for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, set up your stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. In the bowl of the mixer, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. Then make a well in the middle. Add yeast mixture, eggs, and vanilla extract. Use a wooden spoon to incorporate the ingredients from the inner well, bringing the flour mixture into the beaten egg mixture.Then use the dough hook to mix the dough on medium speed for 10 minutes.Add the softened butter a tablespoon at a time, mixing well for a minute or two after each addition.Then turn the mixer to medium high and mix for 5 more minutes.Then butter a large bowl and use a spatula to turn the dough into that bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and allow the dough to double in size, which takes about 60-90 minutes.*If you are making this overnight flaky brioche then leave the dough tightly wrapped in the fridge overnight for about 12 hours.BUTTER BLOCKFor the butter block use dry butter that is at least 84% fat. This entire recipe uses European butter.Arrange the butter onto parchment paper and set another piece of parchment on top. Gently tap the butter block until it’s an 8 x 8 square. Chill for 30 minutes.LAMINATING THE BRIOCHEBrioche Feuilletee is all about layers within flaky layers. I made a few plain buns below to show you the lamination and how they rise from within if you bake them separately on a baking sheet rather than in a loaf pan.When the dough has doubled in size, lightly flour a surface and turn the dough onto that surface. Flatten the brioche dough and gently flatten it into a square. Then roll it out to a rectangle that is about 16″ x 24″. Place the butter block in the middle of the rectangle. Then bring the bottom third up and over the butter. Bring the top third down over that. Essentially, fold it like a letter. Then use the rolling pin to gently push on the dough to seal in the butter block, pinching the seams as needed to conceal butter. Roll it out to seal in the butter. Turn it 90 degrees and repeat the letter folding process. Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Chill 20-30 minutes.Bring the dough out of the fridge. Roll it into a rectangle once again. Then repeat the folding and chilling process once more.CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT FILLED BRIOCHE*The following recipe gives you the option of filling the flaky brioche with chocolate hazelnut spread, like Nutella, or having it plain. For the plain version, brush on melted butter in place of the chocolate hazelnut spread.For the last roll, roll it very thin so it is about 1/16 inch thickness. After you have rolled it out for the last time, either brush it with melted butter or spread chocolate hazelnut spread over the dough, if using.Then use a pizza or pastry cutter to cut the dough through the middle so you have two even pieces. Trim the sides as necessary so you have straight edges and even pieces. Roll up each side from theshortside until you have two big layered rolls. Chill 20 minutes. Then slice each roll in half with a sharp knife so you have 4 equal portions.Butter and line 2 9 x 5 loaf pans. Set parchment with overhang inside for easy lifting, if desired. Then place two flaky brioche buns into each pan. Cover and let rise for another hour.Preheat oven to 375 degrees.Bake the brioche loaves for 25-30 minutes, until crisped and golden.
