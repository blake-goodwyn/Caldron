See my tips below for ensuring your milk is at the right temperature., Granulated sugar:this is used tosweetenthe cinnamon rolls and to help activate the yeast., Quick rise yeast:usequick rise or instant yeastin this recipe to help the cinnamon rolls rise faster. You can also use active dry yeast, but the cinnamon rolls may take slightly longer to rise. Scroll down to get tips for using yeast in this recipe!, Butter:the one and only. I prefer to use salted butter but unsalted is great too. You’ll need it for the dough, filling and icing., Egg + egg yolk:this recipe calls for 1 egg and 1 egg yolk for the perfect texture and rich consistency in the dough., Bread flour:to help keep these cinnamon rolls soft and fluffy, we’re usingbread flour, which has a higher protein level to help lighten the cinnamon roll texture. The higher amounts of protein help to produce more gluten, which gives cinnamon roll the chewy, soft texture you know and love., Brown sugar:personally, I love usingdark brown sugarfor more robust molasses sweet flavor in those cinnamon swirls, but light brown sugar will work!, Cinnamon:YUM., Salt:cinnamon rolls made without salt tastes very plain and in addition, salt also helps to control yeast in cinnamon roll recipes so don’t skip it., For the icing:the icing is truly unforgettable too! Just cream cheese, butter,powdered sugarandvanilla., Active dry yeast:this type of yeast must be dissolved in liquid, or also what’s known as being “proofed” before it’s added to the rest of the dough ingredients. You’ll know this type of yeast is activated when little bubbles start to appear in the liquid that you dissolve the yeast in (for this recipe it’s warm milk)., Instant yeast:also known asquick rise yeast(this is the brand I use and love!) and what we are using for this cinnamon roll recipe. It can be added to the dough without any ‘proofing’ required, so you don’t need to sit and watch the yeast to make sure it bubbles. However, I still like to dissolve it in a little bit of milk and sugar to help get it started., Don’t overheat your milk.It should be between 105-115 degrees F. Anything hotter is likely to kill the yeast, which means the cinnamon rolls will not rise. A simple tip is to dip your finger in the milk — it should feel warm similar to warm bath water but not HOT. If you warmed it up too much, simply wait a few minutes until it cools down enough to touch., Make sure to use room temperature butter for the filling:a lot of recipes call for using melted butter in the filling, but that will cause the filling to leak out before baking. Room temperature butter is best!, Rub the brown sugar into the butter:after you spread out the softened butter, it’s important to rub the brown sugar into the butter and dough so that it’s well combined. Please refer to the video!, Use a room temperature egg in the dough:if you use a cold egg, there’s a chance it could affect the yeast or mix with the melted butter and cause it to coagulate. To bring your eggs to room temperature simply place them in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes., Use bread flour:bread flour is available at most grocery stores and it makes ALL the difference in achieving softer, fluffy, perfect cinnamon rolls. JUST TRUST ME., Make sure you flour your work surface and the rolling pin:this is to prevent the cinnamon rolls from sticking to the surface or to the rolling pin., Stand mixer.You’ll want to use the dough hook on yourstand mixerto easily knead the dough before rolling it out. Don’t have a stand mixer? No worries! You can also knead the dough by hand., Wooden spoon.I recommend mixing your dough together with awooden spoon., Rolling pin.For rolling out that beautiful dough. Pro tip: if you don’t have arolling pinyou can also flour up a wine bottle!, Serrated knife.Using aserrated knifewill help you cut the cinnamon rolls out after you roll the dough up. You can also use floss., 9×9 inch pan.I recommend using a9×9 inch baking panor 9-inch circular pan so that the cinnamon rolls fit well and bake properly., To freeze before baking:the dough should be frozen after the first rise (once they are rolled up with the filling in and cut). Place into a pan and cover well, then place in freezer. When you are ready to bake, let the dough thaw in the fridge — preferably overnight, then put in a warm spot for 30 minutes to 1 hour before baking to activate the second rise. Bake cinnamon rolls as directed., To freeze after baking:allow the cinnamon rolls to come to room temperature after baking, then you can choose to either freeze the entire pan, making sure they are well wrapped or covered in an airtight container, or you can choose to freeze individual cinnamon rolls. When ready to eat, defrost the cinnamon rolls at room temperature, then warm in the oven at 350 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or you can warm them up individually in the microwave for 20-30 seconds (once defrosted). I prefer to freeze them before they are iced, and then frost them when ready to eat. The icing is also freezer-friendly!, Can I use all purpose flour?The recipe will still work with all purpose flour (and readers have used it with success) but I highly recommend sticking with bread flour because, as I mentioned, it’s what makes these cinnamon rolls extra fluffy and delicious., Why did the middles pop out of my cinnamon rolls?This can happen if you roll them a bit too tightly or your pan is too small. Be sure to cut dough off of the ends of your cinnamon roll log as shown in the video below so that the rolls all fit in your pan., Can I double the recipe?Yep! Just remember to use a larger pan., What can I do if my dough is too sticky while kneading?Simply add a little more flour, about a tablespoon at a time, until it’s easier to work with., Can I use a bread maker?I haven’t tested this recipe using a bread maker, but readers in the comments have done so with success!, Can I add mix-ins to the filling?You bet! I think chopped nuts, raisins, or even other spices like pumpkin pie spice would be delicious., Upside-Down Bananas Foster French Toast Bake, The Best Pumpkin Cinnamon Rolls You’ll Ever Eat, Brown Butter Apple Coffee Cake, Healthy Gingerbread Loaf, Vegan Banana Bread Cinnamon Rolls, Vanilla Brown Butter Pear Baked Oatmeal, For the dough:, ¾cupwarm milk (whole milk or 2% preferred) (110 degrees F), 2 ¼teaspoonsquick rise or active yeast (1/4-ounce package yeast)*, ¼cupgranulated sugar, 1egg plus 1 egg yolk, at room temperature, ¼cupbutter, melted (I prefer salted, but unsalted works, too), 3cupsbread flour, plus more for dusting, 3/4teaspoonsalt, For the filling:, 2/3cupdark brown sugar (light brown sugar also works), 1 ½tablespoonsground cinnamon, ¼cupbutter, softened, For the cream cheese frosting:, 4ozcream cheese, softened, 3tablespoonsbutter, softened, ¾cuppowdered sugar, ½teaspoonvanilla extract, For the dough:, ¾cupwarm milk (whole milk or 2% preferred) (110 degrees F), 2 ¼teaspoonsquick rise or active yeast (1/4-ounce package yeast)*, ¼cupgranulated sugar, 1egg plus 1 egg yolk, at room temperature, ¼cupbutter, melted (I prefer salted, but unsalted works, too), 3cupsbread flour, plus more for dusting, 3/4teaspoonsalt, For the filling:, 2/3cupdark brown sugar (light brown sugar also works), 1 ½tablespoonsground cinnamon, ¼cupbutter, softened, For the cream cheese frosting:, 4ozcream cheese, softened, 3tablespoonsbutter, softened, ¾cuppowdered sugar, ½teaspoonvanilla extract, For the dough:, ¾cupwarm milk (whole milk or 2% preferred) (110 degrees F), 2 ¼teaspoonsquick rise or active yeast (1/4-ounce package yeast)*, ¼cupgranulated sugar, 1egg plus 1 egg yolk, at room temperature, ¼cupbutter, melted (I prefer salted, but unsalted works, too), 3cupsbread flour, plus more for dusting, 3/4teaspoonsalt, For the filling:, 2/3cupdark brown sugar (light brown sugar also works), 1 ½tablespoonsground cinnamon, ¼cupbutter, softened, For the cream cheese frosting:, 4ozcream cheese, softened, 3tablespoonsbutter, softened, ¾cuppowdered sugar, ½teaspoonvanilla extract, For the dough:, ¾cupwarm milk (whole milk or 2% preferred) (110 degrees F), 2 ¼teaspoonsquick rise or active yeast (1/4-ounce package yeast)*, ¼cupgranulated sugar, 1egg plus 1 egg yolk, at room temperature, ¼cupbutter, melted (I prefer salted, but unsalted works, too), 3cupsbread flour, plus more for dusting, 3/4teaspoonsalt, For the filling:, 2/3cupdark brown sugar (light brown sugar also works), 1 ½tablespoonsground cinnamon, ¼cupbutter, softened, For the cream cheese frosting:, 4ozcream cheese, softened, 3tablespoonsbutter, softened, ¾cuppowdered sugar, ½teaspoonvanilla extract, Warm milk to around 110 degrees F. I like to do this by placing milk in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving it for 40-45 seconds. It should be like warm bath water. Transfer warm milk to the bowl of an electric mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Add in sugar, egg, egg yolk and melted butter. Mix until well combined. Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form., Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it's TOO sticky (meaning it's sticking to the bottom of the mixer, add in 2 tablespoons more bread flour.) If you don’t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface., Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour to 1 ½ hours, or until doubled in size. This may more or less time depending the humidity and temperature in your home., After dough has doubled in size, transfer dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a 14x9 inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over dough, leaving a ¼ inch margin at the far side of the dough., In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter., Tightly roll dough up, starting from the 9-inch side and place seam side down making sure to seal the edges of the dough as best you can. You will probably need to cut off about an inch off the ends of the dough as the ends won’t be as full of cinnamon sugar as we’d want it to be., Cut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife or floss. You should get 9 large pieces., Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x9 inch baking pan or round 9 inch cake pan. (I also recommend lining the pan with parchment paper as well, in case any of the filling ends up leaking out.) Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30-45 minutes., Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. You want to underbake them a little so they stay soft in the middle, that’s why we want them just slightly golden brown. Allow them to cool for 5-10 minutes before frosting. Makes 9 cinnamon rolls., To make the frosting:In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth and fluffy.

Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form., Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it's TOO sticky (meaning it's sticking to the bottom of the mixer, add in 2 tablespoons more bread flour.) If you don’t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface., Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel.

I haven’t tried this with a gluten-free all purpose flour, and I think the outcome likely would be different, would recommend looking for a gluten-free specific recipe if needed., Milk. Whole milk is best here due to its protein and fat content, but I’ve successfully made this recipe with 2% milk and non-dairy milks. Oat milk is the closest in texture and results to dairy milk, so if you need to use a plant-based milk that’s what I’d recommend. Almond milk will result in a much thinner dough and you’ll likely need to add more flour to compensate., Oil. Olive oil, canola oil, and even melted coconut oil will work here., Granulated sugar. I’ve heard that honey or maple syrup may work as well, but have not tried this., Instant yeast or active dry yeast. Either one will work – 1 packet needed (2 and 1/4 teaspoons)., Salt, Baking powder and baking soda(I know, these are unusual in a cinnamon roll recipe but they help the dough be pliable and not sticky), Melted unsalted butter– you could substitute a vegan butter or even melted coconut oil if needed here, Brown sugar– coconut sugar would likely work as well, Cinnamon, Cream cheese.Full fat recommended, and allow it to come to room temperature before using. I have not tried a vegan cream cheese replacement but I think it would work., Unsalted butter.I think a vegan butter would work as a substitute but again, have not tried it., Powdered sugar (confectioner’s sugar), Vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste. I highly recommend using the paste if you can find it, as it is thick and has flecks of vanilla in it!, Milk of choice. Dairy or non-dairy milk will both work here., Salt. Essential to set off the sweetness of the icing., Whisk together room temperature cream cheese and room temperature butter in a medium bowl until completely combined and smooth.  Add vanilla extract and salt, and whisk again., Whisk in powdered sugar until fully blended (no lumps!)., Add milk, 1 Tablespoon at a time, until the mixture reaches a pourable, but still thick, consistency., Pour and spread the icing evenly over warm or cooled cinnamon rolls in the pan, making sure the tops of the rolls are completely covered., If the cinnamon rolls are still warm when you ice them, the cream cheese icing will melt fully into all the nooks and crannies. If the cinnamon rolls are cool when you spread the icing on, the icing will sit on top and look prettier but will not sink into the rolls quite as much. Your call!","Combine the milk, oil, and sugar in a large pot (I used aDutch oven) and place over medium heat until just before boiling (or microwave this mixture in a large bowl until just before boiling).  Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool until just warm to the touch, about 105-110 degrees F., Sprinkle the yeast over the top of the milk mixture and let sit for 1-2 minutes.  Add 4 cups (500g) of the flour and stir with a wooden spoon until an evenly combined dough has formed., Cover and let sit on the stove (with the oven on if your kitchen is cold) to rise for about 1 hour.  Check after 30 minutes to make sure it is rising.  By the end of the hour, it should have doubled in size and smell yeasty., Add the remaining 1/2 cup (62g) flour along with the baking powder, baking soda, and salt, and stir until completely combined.  The dough should be easy to handle and not sticky.  If it is sticky, place the dough in the fridge for an hour, and it should be much more pliable., Divide the dough in halfand roll one half out on a WELL floured surface to about a 12×8 inch rectangle.  It helps to dust flour over the dough and your rolling pin before you roll it out to ensure it doesn't stick.  Spread half the melted butter evenly over the dough, then sprinkle half the brown sugar over top, followed by half the cinnamon., Starting with the long edge farthest from you, roll the dough towards you, moving your fingers evenly back and forth along the dough, until it is tightly coiled with seam down.  Cut into 8 even rolls with a sharp knife or unflavored dental floss, and place in a greasedpie plateor9-inch round cake pan., Repeat steps 5 and 6 with the second half of the dough., Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Let the rolls rest on the counter for 15-20 minutes while the oven preheats, until they are slightly puffed.  Bake for 20-22 minutes, until golden brown.

You may not use all the flour.

Allow to rise until doubled (45-90 minutes). If your room is cold consider creating a proofing box in your oven by turning it on warm, then turning it off and letting it sit for 5 minutes before adding your dough to the oven., When the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it down to a 12x18 inch rectangle Spread softened butter over the dough leaving a small margin on the far shorter side of the dough., Mix together brown sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle it evenly over the dough., Roll the dough up and pinch it off on the end that you left unbuttered., Slice into 18 1-inch pieces using a sharp serrated knife., Put cinnamon rolls in a 9x13 casserole.

When you are ready to enjoy them, remove from the freezer and continue with the directions for the 2nd rise. They will take about 3 hours to rise from frozen., For the second method, simply bake as written and then cover and freeze in the pan. When you are ready to enjoy let them thaw and then bake at 300 degrees until warm., For the third method, bake at 300 for about 35 minutes until baked through but still pale. Then cover and freeze until ready to use. When ready to eat let thaw and then bake at 350 for 10-15 minutes., For the final method, make the rolls as directed until the second rise.
