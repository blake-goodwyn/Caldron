When doing this, be very careful to not knock out any air.

This time will depend on how hot your oven is running at (I check mine every time with a thermometer), & which tin size you used (for 1lb tin it will be a little quicker).  So I recommend putting the timer on for 25 minutes.  Then turn the tin around & cover the top of the bread with foil (by this point the bread will be well risen and set on just the top crust).    See Photo 7 below.  Don’t put the foil on before that or the batter will stick to the foil.  Now bake for at least another 20 minutes & then check if the banana bread is done, by inserting a wooden cocktail stick into the centre of the bread.  If it comes out clean of crumbs it is ready.  If not, turn the tin, place the foil back on & bake another 5 minutes.  Keep checking until ready.   Then remove from the oven & leave to cool in the tin, on top of a cooling rack, for about 30 minutes .  See Photo 7.', 'Now turn out the banana bread onto a cooling rack & allow to cool down more.  If you used the lining paste, it should literally slip out when turned upside down.  See my little video below of this happening.

If making your own from scratch, simply place 2 cups of oats in a high speed blender and blend until a powder forms, about 20-30 seconds. Avoid using alternative gluten-free flour such as almond flour or coconut flour as these flours absorb moisture differently and would require additional testing.', 'Nuts:Adding nuts is optional, but we love the added crunch and healthy fats.

I also sometimes have it in evening with a cup of herbal tea. Love it. Avoids me from snacking on garbage.I have made a couple of adjustments as I don’t have a blender. I used to add everything to my NINJA (same as a Bullet) type smoothee blender and the results were always pretty good. But lately I put all the oats in the NINJA and blend them to a fine grind, then I put the oats in a mixing bowl add the 3 ripe bananas, 1 tsp baking soda, 2 eggs and I mix it all together with a hand mixer until the bananas are well blended.  The results are perfect every time. I have a really nice size loaf (2+ inches high at the ends and about 3 inches high in middle.
