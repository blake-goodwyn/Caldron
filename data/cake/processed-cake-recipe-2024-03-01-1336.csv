Add the dark rum, cover, and allow the mixture to soak at room temperature for a minimum of 12 hours, or ideally 24 hours prior to preparing the fruit cake batter., Prepare the Fruitcake:Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C) with a rack in the center position. Set aside two 8x4-inchAll Clad Pro-Release Bakeware Loaf Pans. If using these pans, you do not need to line or grease the pans prior to adding the batter.Equipment Note:This fruitcake can also be prepared using 9x5-inch loaf pans. If using other types of pans, lightly grease and line with parchment paper., In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the all purpose flour, baking powder, spices, and salt. Set aside., In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the softened butter and light brown sugar together over medium-high speed for 3 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Reduce speed to medium and add the eggs one at a time, beating just until each egg is incorporated. The mixture will look slightly broken, that’s ok., Over low speed, slowly add the flour mixture until just absorbed. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer. Add the lemon zest, orange zest, fresh orange juice, grated apple, slivered almonds, diced candied ginger, soaked dried fruit mixture (along with any liquid if it hasn’t already been absorbed), and chocoate (if using).Stir mixture with a large spatula, scraping the edges and bottom of the bowl several times, until all of the ingredients are evenly incorporated. It is a very thick, fruit heavy mixture., Transfer and divide the batter evenly among the loaf pans. Use an offset spatula to smooth the batter into an even layer. Set the loaf pans on the center rack, several inches apart from one another. Bake - rotating the pans halfway - for 75 to 90 minutes or until the batter is set and the tops are golden brown. The edges of the cake may also start to pull awayslightlyfrom the edges of the pan. Remove from the oven and place on a rack to cool completely before removing from the pans., Storing and Aging:Once the cake has cooled, carefully remove the cakes from the loaf pans and set upright. Soak two large pieces of cheesecloth in medium sherry or triple sec (*they should be lightly damp, not soaking wet when you wrap the cakes, so you may need to squeeze out any excess liquor). Wrap each cake tightly. Cover loafs with wax paper and foil before transferring to a large Ziploc bag. Store in the refrigerator for up to 6 to 8 weeks (it can often last even longer). You can serve this cake right after it has cooled, but the flavors improve greatly with time (I recommend several days or up to a week, at minimum).Unwrap and re-soak the cheesecloth once a week., For Garnishing:If desired, you can top the fruitcake with a light apricot glaze and whole pecans before serving.Note:I don't recommend glazing the cake if you wish to continue to wrap and age the fruitcake.To Prepare the Glaze:Combine the apricot preserves and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a light simmer, stirring until the glaze is shiny and thin. If it is too thin for glazing, reduce to desired consistency. If it becomes too thick, add a teaspoon of water. Brush the tops of the fruitcakes with apricot glaze and garnish with whole pecans., Serving Notes:Slice fruit cake with a serrated knife. Serve on its own or spread with a small amount of salted butter.","[('flour', 180.0, 'g'), ('baking powder', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('cinnamon', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('ginger', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('nutmeg', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('butter', 4.0, 'oz'), ('sugar', 160.0, 'g'), ('eggs', 5.0, none), ('lemon zest', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('orange zest', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('orange juice', 120.0, 'ml'), ('apple', 1.0, none), ('almonds', 90.0, 'g'), ('crystallized ginger', 3.0, 'tablespoon'), ('soaked fruit mixture', 1.0, 'batch'), ('dark chocolate', 100.0, 'g')]"

The cream cheese should be soft enough that it combines easily into the butter/powdered sugar mixture. Beat on low/medium speed about 1 minute or until the cream cheese is blended in., Add the powdered sugar, strawberry extract, and ¼ cup strawberry puree. Add a touch of pink coloring gel if you'd like., Beat on Medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes (a bit longer if using a hand mixer). Scrape the bowl mid-way through. Do not over beat. You can add more powdered sugar if you'd like to thicken it up more. Refrigerating it for 10-15 minutes will also thicken the consistency., This frosting should be refrigerated., Assembling the Cake, Place the first strawberry cake layer on the pedestal or cake plate. Pipe a dam of the frosting around the edge of the cake (about ½ inch from the edge) using a disposable piping bag with the tip snipped away., Fill the top of the layer with sliced strawberries, followed by a layer of whipping cream (within the dam)., Top with the second layer and repeat above steps.

Once chopped, set aside., In a small microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter for 20-30 seconds until JUST melted., Add in white sugar and brown sugar and use a spatula to stir until combined (* do not use a mixer!). Add in egg and vanilla, then mix. Next, add in baking soda, baking powder, and salt and mix again. Add in flour and mix until all the flour disappears into the dough., Add the ½ cup of chopped chocolate chips and ½ cup of whole chocolate chips into the dough and mix.Immediately proceed to pressing into pan (you don't want the dough sitting out or it will set too much with the melted butter)., Grease a11.5""metalcookie cake pan(don't have one? See notes below.) Although this cookie removes cleanly, if you are worried about it sticking, line the bottom and sides of the pan with parchment paper first. Using a spoon or your clean hands, drop the dough into small chunks in the pan. This will help disperse everything so that you can easily smooth it out. Once all dough as been added, use a spatula or your hands to press down the dough into a smooth layer (being sure to get all the corners).Tip: If you notice 2-3 chocolate chips are stuck together, separate them before baking. This will allow the chocolate to be evenly dispersed and prevent the cookie from having a giant clump of chocolate in one spot (which could cause it to more easily break while cutting)., Bake at 350 degrees for 12-14 minutes - do NOT overbake or your chocolate chip cookie cake will not be soft. You want the cookie cake to be slightly brown on the top and look slightly underbaked (my oven was perfect at 12 minutes). Remove from oven and place entire pan on a cooling rack. Allow the cookie cake to cool completely before removing.Tip: To remove from pan, use a knife to go around the edges, place a flat platter on top, then flip over the pan to remove. If you used parchment paper, this should come out rather smoothly. After flipping over the cookie cake, flip it over again on the final decorate plate or platter (I LOVE these cute paper trays and the largest one in the pack is perfect for a 10"" cookie cake)., Using alarge star piping tip, pipe around the edges then immediately add sprinkles (the frosting will start hardening quick, so add sprinkles right away!).If you're feeling fancy, you can double the frosting recipe to have enough to pipe phrases like ""Happy Birthday"" on the top.

Scrape the bottom and sides to make sure it’s all incorporated., Divide the batter between the 3 prepared pans., Bake the cakes at 325 for about 28-32 minutes., Notes on baking: I like to bake my cakes one at a time because my oven is not exactly amazing. I’ve also done 2 cakes at a time though. I wouldn’t do all 3 cakes at once, unless you have a pretty stellar oven that you trust., However you choose to bake, make sure you rotate them 2/3 of the way through the bake time. This means turn the pan 180 degrees if there is one cake, or if there are two cakes, switch their places. The cake pans should NOT touch the edge of the oven., Do NOT open the oven door at all, except for when you need to rotate the pans. Rotate the pans at about the 22 minute mark. If the whole top looks completely liquidy, do not rotate yet. You don’t want to deflate your cake. Again, the total bake time for each cake is about 28-32 minutes., Remove the cake/s from the oven. Let cool on a cooling rack for about 10-15 minutes. Use a knife to loosen the edge of the cake from the pan. Use your hand to invert the cake onto the cooling rack and continue cooling. At this point I often put them in the freezer for 20 minutes or so to speed up the cool time., Make the frosting:Beat 2 cups butter until it is completely smooth., Add powdered sugar one cup at a time. Add the cream in 1/4 cup increments in between cups of powdered sugar. Add 1 tablespoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. (less if you’re using table salt) Beat until very fluffy, at least 2-3 minutes. Scrape the sides and bottom at least once or twice., Once all the cakes are completely cool,assemble your cake.Smear a bit of frosting on your cake stand so it doesn’t go sliding off, then place your cake on the stand. Place several squares of parchment paper under the edge of your cake so that you don’t get frosting all over your cake stand (see photos)., Add about 1 and 1/2 cups frosting (just eyeball it) to the top of the cake and spread evenly., Add the next cake.

It should be just a little longer than it is wide. Fold the foil in half lengthwise, then fold it in half again to create a rectangle that’s about 6 inches long and 7 inches wide. Repeat to make a dozen rectangles., Place 1 sheet of folded foil on your work surface, with the long side facing you. Place a standard-size plastic or glass spice jar on its side in the center of the foil, the jar’s long side also facing you. Bring the long sides of the foil up around the jar. The foil won’t reach all the way around, and that’s okay. Fold the foil in around both top and bottom ends of the spice jar, nice and tight. You’ll end up with a sort of trough situation. (Cookbook author Todd Wilbur has avideo of the process here; if you’re impatient, fast forward to 1:10, where the action starts.) Repeat until you have 12 foil Twinkie molds. Spritz the molds with an obscenely generous amount of nonstick spray or use your fingertips to coat the molds with vegetable oil. Place the Twinkie molds on a baking sheet or in a roasting pan., Whisk the flours, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl., In a small saucepan over low heat, heat the milk and butter until the butter melts. Remove from the heat add the vanilla. Cover to keep warm., Separate the eggs, placing the whites in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or, if using a hand mixer or whisk, a large mixing bowl) and reserving the yolks in another bowl. Beat the whites on high speed until foamy. Gradually add 6 tablespoons of the sugar and the cream of tartar and continue to beat until the whites reach soft, moist peaks., Dump the beaten egg whites into a large bowl and add the egg yolks to the standing mixer bowl—there’s no need to clean the bowl (or, if using a hand mixer or whisk, simply place the egg yolks in a separate large bowl). Beat the egg yolks with the remaining 6 tablespoons sugar on medium-high speed until the mixture is very thick and a pale lemon color, about 5 minutes. Add the beaten egg whites to the yolks, but do not mix., Sprinkle the flour mixture over the egg whites and then mix everything on low speed for just 10 seconds (or, if using a hand mixer or whisk, until blended but not thoroughly combined). Remove the bowl from the mixer, make a well in one side of the batter, and pour the melted butter mixture into the bowl. Fold gently with a large rubber spatula until the batter shows no trace of flour and the whites and yolks are evenly mixed, about 8 strokes., Immediately scrape the batter into the prepared molds, filling each with about 3/4 inch batter. Bake until the cake tops are light brown and feel firm and spring back when touched, 13 to 15 minutes. Transfer the pan containing the molds to a wire rack and allow the cakes to cool in the molds., Just before filling, remove each cake from the foil. Using the end of a chopstick, poke three holes in the bottom of each cake, just like in the bottom of real Twinkies. Wiggle the tip of the chopstick around quite a lot to make room for the filling. (Again, you can see this in action, beginning at minute 3.), Scoop frosting into a pastry bag fit with a small tip about 1/4 inch across. Pipe the frosting into the holes you created in the bottom of the cakes. As you fill each cake, hold it in your palm and gently exert pressure on it so you can feel the cake expand, taking care not to overfill the cake, which would make it crack., Unlike real Twinkies, these won’t last indefinitely. They’re best served still slightly warm.","[('flour', 0.5, 'cup'), ('flour', 0.25, 'cup'), ('baking powder', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('milk', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('butter', 4.0, 'tablespoons'), ('vanilla extract', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('eggs', 5.0, none), ('sugar', 0.75, 'cup'), ('cream of tartar', 0.25, 'teaspoon')]"

Lightly grease two 8” x 2” or 9” x 2” round cake pans; for extra protection against sticking, line the bottom of the pans with parchment rounds (you can cut these yourself or use precut8”or9”rounds), and grease the parchment. If your 8” pans aren’t at least 2” deep, use 9” pans., Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.To see a full visual walkthrough of this recipe, see our video onhow to make Classic Birthday Cake., In a small bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. Set aside., In a large mixing bowl, either using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer with whisk attachment, beat the eggs, sugar, vanilla, and almond extract, until thickened and light gold in color, about 2 minutes at medium-high speed. If your stand mixer doesn’t have a whisk attachment, beat for 5 minutes using the paddle attachment. The batter should fall in thick ribbons from the beaters, whisk, or paddle., Add the dry ingredients to the mixture in the bowl and mix — by hand or on low speed of a mixer — just enough to combine. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, then mix again briefly, to fully incorporate any residual flour or sticky bits., In a saucepan set over medium heat or in the microwave, bring the milk just to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat and add the butter and oil, stirring by hand until the butter has melted., Slowly mix the hot milk-butter-oil mixture into the batter, stirring on low speed of a mixer until everything is well combined. Scrape the bowl and mix briefly, just until smooth., Divide the batter evenly between the two pans. You’ll use about 2 3/4 cups (about 580g) in each., Bake the cakes until the edges are pulling away from the sides of the pan, a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, and the top feels set. This should take 26 to 30 minutes for two 9” pans, or 38 to 42 minutes for two 8” pans; a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the cakes should read 205°F. Remove the cakes from the oven, carefully loosen the edges, and allow them to cool for 15 minutes in the pans. Then turn them out of the pans and transfer them to a rack, right-side up, to cool to room temperature., To make the frosting:In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, stir together — by hand or mixer — the cocoa powder, 1 cup (113g) of the confectioners’ sugar, and the salt. Stir in the water and vanilla, scraping the bowl if necessary., Add the butter and remaining confectioners’ sugar, stirring to combine. Using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat the frosting at medium-high speed for 1 to 2 minutes, until lightened in color and fluffy, stopping halfway through to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. When the frosting is ready, scoop out a bit on your spatula; does it seem nicely spreadable? If it's too stiff, beat in water (1 teaspoon at a time) until it's the consistency you want., To assemble the cake:Place one of the cake layers on a serving plate; tuck pieces of waxed or parchment paper underneath the edge of the cake to keep the plate clean. Spread the bottom layer with about 1 cup of frosting, enough to make a 1/4” to 1/2”-thick layer. Center the second layer bottom-side up (for a flat top) over the frosted layer and press gently to set it in place., If your schedule permits, place the cake in the refrigerator or freezer, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours) to firm it up. This will make the layers less likely to slide around as you work, and the cake won’t shed crumbs as you frost. If you’re pressed for time, you can skip this step., To finish the cake:For the best-looking cake, do the frosting in two steps. First, spread a very thin layer of frosting around the sides and across the top; this is called a crumb coat. You should be able to see the cake through the frosting in spots, it’s that thin. Refrigerate the cake for 20 minutes to let this layer set. Again, skip this step if time is a factor., Once the cake is chilled, use the remaining frosting to coat it thoroughly and evenly; ourcake styling guideoffers six pro-style options for ""styling"" your cake. If you have any leftover frosting, you can use it to pipe decorations on the top and/or around the base., Store the cake, covered, at room temperature, or in the refrigerator if your kitchen is hot. Let it come to room temperature before serving. For tips on slicing, seeThe best way to cut cake., Storage information:The cake will keep at room temperature, covered with a cake cover, for up to three days; in the refrigerator, covered, for up to one week, or in the freezer, well wrapped, for up to one month.","('[fruit, chocolate]', none, none)"

Wrap a9- or 10-inchspringform pan with one large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, covering the underside and extending all the way to the top so there are no seams on the bottom or sides of the pan. Repeat with another sheet of foil for insurance. Spray the inside of the pan with nonstick cooking spray., Make the crust: In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, sugar, and salt. Stir until well combined. Press the crumbs into an even layer on the the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, until set. Remove the pan from the oven and set aside., Reduce the oven temperature to325°F. Set a kettle of water to boil., Make the batter: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or beaters, beat the cream cheese, sugar, and flour together on medium speed until just smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to be sure the mixture is evenly combined. Add the vanilla, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt; beat on low speed until just combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed until incorporated, scraping the bowl as necessary. Mix in the sour cream. Make sure the batter is uniform but do not over-mix., Check to make sure your oven has cooled to325°F, then set the cheesecake pan in a large roasting pan. Pour the batter on top of the crust. Pour the boiling water into the large roasting pan to come about 1 inch up the side of the cake pan. Bake until the cake is just set, 1 hour and 30 minutes to 1 hour and 45 minutes. (If the cheesecake starts to look too golden on top towards the end, cover it loosely with foil.) The cake should not look liquidy at all but will wobble just a bit when the pan is nudged; it will continue to cook as it cools. Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven and set it on a wire rack. Cool the cheesecake in the water bath until the water is just warm, about 45 minutes. Remove the springform pan from the water bath and discard the foil. If necessary, run a thin-bladed knife around the edge of the cake to make sure it's not sticking to the sides (which can cause cracks as it cools), then cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to cool for at least 8 hours or overnight., For serving:Remove the sides of the springform pan. Serve the cheesecake right from the base of the pan; or, to transfer it to a serving platter, run a long, thin spatula between the crust and the pan bottom, and then use two large spatulas to carefully transfer the cheesecake to a serving dish. Slice with a sharp knife, wiping the knife clean between slices. Serve withberry sauce, if you like., Make Ahead:The cheesecake can be made and stored in the springform pan in the fridge, tightly covered with plastic wrap, up to two days ahead of time., Freezer-Friendly Instructions:The cheesecake can be frozen for up to 3 months. To freeze, place the cake in the freezer briefly, unwrapped, to firm it up. Then double-wrap it tightly with aluminum foil or plastic freezer wrap, or place it in heavy-duty freezer bag. Thaw in the refrigerator the night before you plan to eat it., Pro Tip: Springform pans are notorious for leaking. Since a cheesecake bakes in a water bath, the foil prevents the water from seeping in during baking. Please do not attempt to use standard 12-inch (30cm) aluminum foil – you can’t have any foil seams on the bottom or sides of the pan. No matter how well (or how many times) you wrap the pan, if there are seams exposed to the water, the water will find a way in. Even when wrapped properly, you can occasionally get some condensation inside the foil. If this happens, don’t worry – the crust is likely just a bit moist around the edges. Simply remove the sides of the springform pan before refrigerating and let it dry out in the refrigerator.","[('graham cracker crumbs', 1.5, 'cups'), ('unsalted butter', 5, 'tablespoons')]"

(The smaller pan will cook more slowly as the cake will be thicker.) My favourite pan is 10 inches in diameter. I like to use a springform pan as it makes the cake easier to remove from the pan., Mix the soaked dried fruit with the chopped and ground almonds. Set aside., Sift the flour, cocoa, salt, baking powder and mixed spice together.., In a separate bowl, cream the butter and brown sugar., Add the lemon rind., Add the beaten eggs a little at a time, beating after each addition., Fold in the flour mixture, the coffee essence and then the dried fruit and nuts., Turn the mixture into the prepared cake pan and smooth over the surface, making a slight hollow in the centre so the cake will rise evenly., Bake at 325ºF (160ºC or 150ºC for a fan oven) for 45 minutes, and then reduce the temperature to 300ºF (150ºC or 140ºC for a fan oven) for a further 40 to 60 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean. Do keep an eye on the cake while it is baking as oven temperatures do vary radically and you don't want it to burn. Equally you do not want the cake under-cooked, so be sure that the skewer is coming out clean from the centre of the cake. That is when it is done, regardless of baking time., Cool the cake in the pan for at least an hour and then carefully remove it to cool on a wire rack., After the cake is completely cook you can wrap it in foil. If you are making it well ahead of time, you can keep it in a cool dry place for six to eight weeks, feeding it once a week with a bit more rum. Of course, if you make the cake closer to the time you want to serve it, you can still 'feed' it in this way once a week until you cover it with marzipan., A day or so before serving, we traditionally cover our Christmas cakes with marzipan and royal icing. You can use store bought marzipan and royal icing if you prefer (and I always do!) but the traditional recipes follow., To make the marzipan from scratch, mix the ground almonds, sugar and icing sugar together., Rub or cut the butter into this mixture until it looks like coarse breadcrumbs., Mix the egg yolks and lemon juice and add them to this mixture., Work the paste to a stiff but pliable consistency, adding a bit more lemon juice if it seems dry., Divide the almond paste in half., Using a light dusting of corn flour (corn starch) to prevent sticking, roll the first half into a circle that will cover the top of the cake., Brush the top and sides of the cake with the sieved apricot jam, and apply the circle to the top of the cake, pressing firmly., Using your hands, roll the second half of the almond paste into a long roll and then flatten it as evenly as you can with a rolling pin. This piece needs to be wide enough to cover the sides of the cake., Press the flattened roll along the sides of the cake, pressing firmly and sealing the joins between the top and sides with your fingers., Leave the cake in a cool airy place for several hours so the almond paste can dry out a bit., To make the royal icing, beat the egg whites lightly., Add the lemon juice and glycerine., Beat in enough icing sugar to make a thick coating consistency that rolls easily off a wooden spoon, but leaves it coated., Place the marzipan topped cake on a piece of greaseproof or waxed paper. Have a palette knife to hand to help guide the icing. Pour the icing bit by bit over the top of the cake, spreading it with the knife. Let it find its way down the sides, guiding it with the knife until the cake is completely covered. Leave the cake in a cool airy place overnight, or until the icing has set.","[('currants', 1.0, 'pound'), ('sultanas', 6.0, 'ounces'), ('raisins', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('mixed peel', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('glacé cherries', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('rum', 0.75, 'cup'), ('almonds', 1.0, 'ounce'), ('ground almonds', 1.0, 'ounce'), ('flour', 9.0, 'ounces'), ('cocoa', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('baking powder', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('mixed spice', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('butter', 9.0, 'ounces'), ('eggs', 4.0, none), ('brown sugar', 9.0, 'ounces'), ('lemon rind', none, none), ('coffee essence', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('almond icing', none, none), ('ground almonds', 8.0, 'ounces'), ('caster sugar', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('icing sugar', 5.0, 'ounces'), ('butter', 2.0, 'ounces'), ('egg yolks', 2.0, none), ('lemon juice', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('apricot jam', 3.0, 'tablespoons'), ('royal icing', none, none), ('egg whites', 4.0, none), ('icing sugar', 1.5, 'pounds'), ('lemon juice', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('glycerine', 1.0, 'teaspoon')]"

Well, I may have cheated a bit by adding salt and vanilla extract, but wow! This cake has great texture, airy and fluffy. People don’t believe me when I say I use no oil, dairy, and most importantly, baking powder! As long as the eggs are beaten properly, the cake rises very well and just melts in your mouth.That said, this cake falls more on the sweeter end of the spectrum, a tad too sweet for my liking. Which is tricky, because the proportion of the sugar also plays an important role in shaping the cake’s texture. From what I see, this isn’t something you could just replace with stevia and call it the day.So I felt experimental and modified this into a 4-ingredient chocolate cake recipe (cheatable for flavouring additives, of course) by replacing ¼  cup of the sugar with cocoa powder. While the cake still tasted delicious, the cocoa weighed down the batter and I ended up with a texture similar to a dry pound cake. So dry that I need to dip the cake in milk for it to get to a texture I enjoy.I would like to make this cake again, the OG version, of course. But if possible, I would really love a less sweet version of this cake, like maybe half the sugar or so. Would love to hear from people who have made that work!Kirbie's Cravings Team—September 9, 2022 @ 12:27 pmReplyThanks for sharing your experience!, Kirbie's Cravings Team—September 9, 2022 @ 12:27 pmReplyThanks for sharing your experience!, Katherine—August 20, 2022 @ 7:59 amReplyBefore I added the flour I added 1 very ripe banana, mixed it in.

It had the nice crackly surface which was nice! But it was only fluffy when it first came out. Once the cake cooled, it was tough. I made sure to sift the flour and even bought a new spatula (we never had an actual spatula for folding) to follow this recipe to a T. Not sure what went wrong, but maybe I’ll give it another try someday.Kirbie's Cravings Team—September 24, 2021 @ 7:11 pmReplyWe’re sorry to hear you had trouble with the recipe. It sounds like you might have deflated the eggs while folding in the flour. The sifting is helpful, but if the eggs are mixed too much they will deflate and cause the cake to sink. Overmixing can also make the cake tough because the gluten in the flour was worked too much.

Go search on YouTube, there are many tutorials teaching you how to make extremely light and fluffy cakes with just sugar, eggs and flour, Kysara—July 22, 2021 @ 11:31 pmReplyYour recipe is very well known as Angel Food Cake, Taiwanese Castella Cake etc. However, there is a crucial step that you have missed, which creates an extremely light ans fluffy cake, and all just using the same 3 ingredients. Basically, egg whites and yolk should be separated from the start. Egg whites are beaten with sugar until an meringue is formed. Afterwards, lightly beaten egg yolks are folded gently into the meringue, followed by sifted cake flour, also gently folded in. This method creates a light and fluffy came, far superior than your method. Unless, you don’t want a light and fluffy cake, that is. There are many tutorial videos on YouTube if you don’t understand the processKirbie—July 24, 2021 @ 1:55 amReplyHi, yes I am aware of separating egg whites from egg yolks technique. I purposely wanted to make a cake that doesn’t require making a meringue first. I’ve shared many cakes using the separated eggs technique but I love that this recipe doesn’t need that.

This is a good recipe and it is distinct from other similar cakes in its simplicity. And I’m not sure if it was intentional, but that came across as very condescending toward the author. It’s one thing to comment that you noticed a similarity (and a difference) to other recipes, but telling the author that she’s doing it wrong and suggesting that she doesn’t “understand the process” of separating eggs is unnecessarily harsh and not useful criticism when she’s already made it clear the recipe was simplified to make it easier for people to make.Caroline Perry—August 22, 2021 @ 2:43 pmHi JackieYour comment/reply is spot on!

Mix until well combined (you do not need to sift it yet). Set aside., In a medium sized bowl add in the egg whites and white vinegar, and using a hand or stand mixer, whip on a medium high speed for 30 seconds until foamy. Gradually add in 1/3 cup of the sugar and then continue mixing for a further 2 minutes. Then turn your mixer down to low and mix for a further minute (about 4 minutes of mixing altogether). You should end up with stiff peaks (see note 3). Set aside., In a large bowl add in your remaining 1/3 cup of white sugar and warm water. Mix so that the sugar is coated in the water. Add in the egg yolks and vanilla, and with a hand or stand mixer, whip on a medium high speed for 4 minutes, and then turn the mixer down to low and mix for a further minute (5 minutes of mixing altogether). Your mixture should now be thick and you should be able to create ribbons with it when you lift it up with a spoon., Stream the vegetable oil into the egg yolk mixture while mixing on a medium speed. Mix until well combined., Add in half of your egg whites to your egg yolk mixture, and using a spatula gently fold together until just combined., Then sift in your dry ingredients, and gently fold through until just combined., Finish off by adding in the remaining egg whites and gently fold until just combined. You can use your spatula to break up any large chunks of unmixed egg whites but try not to push out too many of the air bubbles and do not overmix., Distribute the batter into your baking tins and then tap your baking tins lightly on your counter. Then run a thin knife or toothpick through the batter to remove any large air bubbles and then bake for 25 minutes. To test whether they're done, gently touch the tops and it should create a little indent which slowly bounces back., Once the sponges are done, immediately tap them on the counter from a height of about 10cm, and lay them upside down (while still in their baking tins) on a wire rack to completely cool (see note 4)., Once cooled (about an hour later), run a thin knife around the edges to release the cakes from the cake tins, and then turn them out onto a wire rack., To make my cake layers look nice and neat, I gently rub my fingers around the edges and the top and that removes the dark crust on the sides and tops of the cake (see video for demonstration). I find the dark crust on sponge cakes are also what contain that slight eggy after taste sometimes, which is why I prefer to remove it., APPLY SIMPLE SYRUP: Combine the sugar and hot water together for the simple syrup and mix until the sugar is completely dissolved. Using a pastry brush, generously brush the top and sides of the sponges with the simple syrup (see note 5).

I like to weigh my pans to make sure they're even., Bake for 30 minutes and check your cakes. Do the ""done test"". Insert a toothpick to see if it comes out clean. Sometimes wet batter doesn't show up so make sure it's clean and not just wet. Then gently touch the top of the cake, does it spring back? Oven temperatures vary so if it's not done yet, bake for a few more minutes (2-3) and check again until it passes the ""done"" test., Remove the cakes from the oven and give them a tap on the countertop to release air and prevent too much shrinking. Let them cool on a cooling rack until they are barely warm., After cooling for about 10 minutes, place the cooling rack on top of the cake, placing one hand on top of the cooling rack and one hand under the pan and flip the pan and the cooling rack over so the pan is now upside down on the cooling rack. Remove the pan carefully. Repeat with the other pan., After the cakes are fully cooled, carefully wrap them in plastic wrap and place them into the freezer or fridge for about 30 minutes to firm up the cakes and make them easier to handle for stacking.","[('milk', 4.0, 'ounces'), ('oil', 3.0, 'ounces'), ('milk', 6.0, 'ounces'), ('vanilla', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('vanilla', 1.0, none), ('eggs', 3.0, 'large'), ('cake flour', 13.0, 'ounces'), ('sugar', 13.0, 'ounces'), ('baking powder', 3.0, 'teaspoons'), ('baking soda', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('butter', 8.0, 'ounces')]"

Grease and line a 9-inch round springform pan with parchment paper., Make the sponge: Place the eggs and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat on high speed until pale and thickened. Properly whipped batter should be light and thick, and fall in a ribbon back into the bowl leaving trails of batter on the surface. Set a timer for 5 minutes; the mixture should triple in volume. In a separate bowl, whisk the flours (or cornstarch), baking powder and salt together. Carefully fold the dry mixture into the egg mixture until thoroughly combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 27-30 minutes or until a toothpick tester comes out clean. Let the cake cool slightly in the pan for a few minutes then remove the springform collar. Peel away the parchment and let cool completely on a wire rack., Optional: The baked genoise will be lightweight and the exterior dry and firm. When it's completely cool, wrap the cake in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator overnight to soften the cake's exterior. This will make it easier to cut. The cake can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days., Make the custard filling: Stir together the milk, egg yolks, cornstarch, and sugar in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens. The minute the mixture starts to thicken, remove it from the heat source and whisk vigorously. Stir in the vanilla. Transfer to a bowl and let cool slightly. Press plastic wrap over the surface of the custard and refrigerate until firm. The chilled custard should be thick and hold in the bowl of a spoon., Make the stabilized whipped cream: Sprinkle the gelatin over the 2 tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Let stand until set. Place the heavy cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whip attachment. Set mixer speed to medium and beat until soft peaks form. Gradually add in the powdered sugar and then mix in the vanilla. Heat gelatin in the microwave for 5-7 seconds, or until completely liquid. Gradually add liquid gelatin to whipped cream in a thin stream with the mixer running. After all of the gelatin is added, increase mixer speed to high and beat to stiff peaks. Remove 1/2 cup of the whipped cream and set aside., Build the layers: Torte the cake into three layers using a serrated knife. The layers will be very thin so do this carefully. Place the bottom cake layer on a plate or cake board. Spread on the raspberry jam. Top with 1/2 of the custard filling. Top with a second cake layer. Spread over the remaining 1/2 of custard. Pile all of the whipped cream on top and smooth into a dome shape using a large spatula. Place the final cake layer on top and press down so that all of the cake’s edges are smoothed against the whipped cream and a dome shape is formed. Cover with the reserved 1/2 cup of stabilized whipped cream., Prep and cover with marzipan: Dust a work surface with powdered sugar. Knead the marzipan with your hands to soften and place it on the work surface. Add a small amount of leaf green food color to the marzipan and knead in until a consistent green color is achieved. Lightly add powdered sugar as needed to prevent sticking. Roll it to a large circle, lifting to occasionally dust underneath with powdered sugar to prevent sticking. Gently lay the marzipan circle over the top of the cake and use your hands to form the marzipan to the shape of the cake. Trim the excess marzipan from the bottom of the cake using a pizza or pastry wheel. Gently tuck the bottom edges of the marzipan under the cake using the back of a butter knife., Decors: Paint the white Wilton candy roses with a little Baker’s Rose food color dissolved in clear extract. Use a kitchen-dedicated art brush with soft bristles so the food color can easily be brushed between the petals., Tint leftover marzipan with a little more leaf green food color, and roll flat on a powdered sugar-dusted work surface. Cut small star-shaped flowers from the marzipan using a fondant cutter.

Let cool completely before frosting or storing., Make the Frosting:In a large mixing bowl, cream softened butter, cream cheese, and mascarpone together with an electric mixer for 2 minutes on high speed. Mix in the powdered sugar, 2 cups at a time, until well combined. Add milk, vanilla, and salt and mix until well combined.Add up to 1/2 cup additional powdered sugar if the frosting is too thin or could use a little extra sweetness., Assemble + Frost Cake:Place one cake layer on your cake stand, and spread with 1 and 1/4 cups of the frosting, spreading the frosting out and a bit over the edges of the cake. Pipe a border of frosting around the edge, and then add 1/2 cup of the cranberry jam. Spread it evenly with an offset spatula within the piped border. Add the second cake layer and smooth the frosting overhang around the sides to seal the layers together. Chill for 5-10 minutes, then repeat with second layer. Add the top cake layer upside down to create a level top to your cake.Use remaining frosting to cover the top of the cake and dot the bare sides of the cake in random places, all the way around. Use acake smoother/scraperto smooth the dots of frosting by holding it against the side of the cake, and slowly turning the cake and pulling the cake smoother towards you while turning the cake the opposite direction.Continue until desired naked cake effect is reached. Create swirls on the top of the cake using a spoon, and decorate with the trees (place the sprigs upside down to make trees) and cranberries. Sprinkle withwhite sanding sugarfor a fresh snowfall  effect., Serve + Store:Chill the assembled cake for at least 30 minutes before serving. Store leftovers tightly covered in the fridge for 4-6 days., Make Ahead Tips:The frosting and cake layers can be made a day in advance, along with the sugared cranberries and rosemary trees. Make cake layers and let cool completely. Place each on a plate and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Store at room temp until ready to use. Cover frosting tightly and keep in fridge – take out a little bit before frosting the cake so it's not solid as a rock and un-spreadable.Sugared cranberries + rosemary can be made a day ahead and kept in the fridge, in an airtight container with a small bowl of rice inside, to prevent sogginess.","[('all-purpose flour', 2.0, 'cups'), ('white whole wheat flour', 1.0, 'cup'), ('salt', 0.75, 'tsp'), ('baking powder', 3.0, 'tsp'), ('cinnamon', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('ground cloves', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('ground ginger', 1.5, 'tsp'), ('nutmeg', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('butter', 1.0, 'cup'), ('brown sugar', 0.67, 'cup'), ('granulated sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('eggs', 4.0, 'large'), ('vanilla', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('molasses', 1.0, 'cup'), ('buttermilk', 1.0, 'cup')]"

If you put the cake plate on top of a cake layer (which is on the cooling rack) and flip everything over, the rounded part will be on top. If you have a different preferred way of transferring cake layers, do whatever you like. It doesn’t really matter if the rounded part of the cake layer ends up on top in the end, as it’s not very domed., Spread 3/4 cup (173 grams) of pink frosting on top., Add the other layer on top, flat side up., Use a ruler and measure out two 5” lines, forming a right angle. This will be the bottom of the heart., Cut away those curved bits, but be careful with them as they’re going to help form the top of the heart., Use about 2 tbsp frosting to help attach the rounded cut-offs to the main cake piece to form a heart shape. You’ll have to bend them a little., My heart shape looked pretty bad at this point, so I cut away a little bit at the very top, in the middle, and then the heart looked perfect., Use about 1/3 to 1/2 cup (76-115 grams) as a crumb coat.

I added another 3/8 tsp of McCormick berry powder to the remaining pink frosting (about 1 1/3 cup) for the darker pink shell boarder., Use tip Wilton 32 to pipe a small shell border around the top and bottom of the cake (see post for a video)., Use the reserved white frosting to pipe on small dots or whatever you’d like. I used Wilton tip 18 for the white shell border and Wilton tip 3 for the curved white lines., If you still have pink frosting leftover, you can add whatever decoration you’d like with that or add a little more pink food coloring for a third shade of pink, and pipe on more stuff., Just before serving, place maraschino cherries around the top border., Cover and refrigerate the finished cake for up to 4 days.

You won’t really taste the pineapple in the cake, but it will help keep it tender, thanks to its acid content and natural enzymes.

However, I find it's actually easier to mix all the dry ingredients first and then add the wet ingredients., When the batter is smooth, divide it between the two cake pans and bake for 20-25 min or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean., Let the cakes cool completely before frosting., For the chocolate buttercream:  NOTE: if you don't want to cover the cake in buttercream rosettes, you only need ½ of the icing recipe, so make sure to adjust the ingredient quantities accordingly., Melt the butter either over a low flame or in the microwave for 1-2 minutes, stirring every 15-30 seconds., Stir in the cocoa powder, salt, and vanilla., Alternate the confectioner's sugar with the milk, beating well until smooth, an electric mixer makes it easier to beat., Taste, and add more salt and vanilla as needed.","[('sugar', 2.0, 'cups'), ('boiling hot water', 2.0, 'cups'), ('coconut oil', 0.5, 'cup'), ('vinegar', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('instant espresso powder', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('baking soda', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('salt', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('unsweetened cocoa powder', 1.0, 'cup'), ('all-purpose flour', 2.0, 'cups')]"

Butter and line two 8-inch round baking pans with parchment paper. Butter parchment., In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt, whisking until thoroughly combined. Add eggs, buttermilk, water, oil, and vanilla and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until all dry ingredients are incorporated. Divide evenly among prepared pans., Bake for 40 to 45 minutes (30 to 35 minutes for a 6-inch cake) or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack until cool enough to handle. Run a small knife around the edges of each pan, then gently invert onto wire racks. Cakes should come out cleanly. Peel off parchment and allow cake layers to cool completely. At this point, the cakes can be frozen until ready to use, up to 1 month. Simply wrap each layer individually in a double layer of plastic wrap and then store inside a large zip top bag (I find frozen cakes to be much easier to work with later, and always freeze mine even if I’m finishing the cake the next day)., To prepare frosting, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat butter on medium speed until very pale and creamy, about 5 minutes. Add sifted powdered sugar and cocoa powder and mix to combine. Add sour cream, hot water, vanilla and salt and mix on low speed until the liquid is incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. It may look slightly curdled at this point, but don’t worry. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until smooth, another 2-3 minutes. Add lukewarm chocolate and mix until smooth and glossy. At this point you have about 30 minutes at cool room temperature (longer in the summer) to work with the frosting before it begins to harden (this frosting doesn’t do particularly well when made ahead of time)., To assemble, level your cake layers first if necessary (if there is any sort of domed top, you want to trim that off with a serrated knife). Place one layer, bottom side up, on a cake stand or serving platter (on a piece of parchment if you will need to move it). Spread about 1 cup of frosting in an even layer, then place second layer on top, flat side up, pressing gently to adhere., Cover the entire cake with a thin layer of buttercream using an offset spatula. This “crumb coat” will seal in the cake crumbs and make the final layer of frosting easier. If your cakes were frozen this should firm up pretty quickly, otherwise refrigerate for about 10 minutes to set., Slather with remaining buttercream in a thick layer, reserving some for piping decorative details if desired.","[('sugar', 2.0, 'cups'), ('flour', 1.75, 'cups'), ('cocoa powder', 1.0, 'cup'), ('baking soda', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('baking powder', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('eggs', 2.0, none), ('buttermilk', 1.0, 'cup'), ('boiling water', 1.0, 'cup'), ('vegetable oil', 0.75, 'cup'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'tablespoon')]"

Fold in the shredded apples and their juice., Spray your Bundt pan with cooking spray, making sure to evenly coat the entire inner surface. Pour your batter into the pan. Bundt pan depths vary, so make sure the batter fills the pan ¾ full or less. Do not fill beyond ¾ or your cake might overflow during baking. Use a spatula to gently push the batter to the outside of the pan, pushing slightly up the walls. This will help to get rid of any air pockets that might interfere with the pretty details of the pan. Smooth the batter on the top so it is flat and even all the way around the pan., Bake cake in preheated oven for 75-90 minutes (if you're using a black or dark-colored bundt pan, yours may bake faster - start checking around 50 minutes). When the edges darken and pull fully away from the sides of the pan, and the cake browns all the way across the surface, insert a toothpick deep into the thickest part of the cake. If it comes out clean, it's done. It’s a very moist cake, so it’s easy to undercook it– err on the side of caution and let it bake a little longer if you’re unsure (but don't bake it too long or it will dry out!)., Let the cake cool for exactly 10 minutes, then invert it onto a flat plate. Tap the Bundt pan gently to release the cake. If your cake sticks, use a plastic knife to carefully loosen the cake around the center tube and sides. Allow cake to cool completely (very important to let it cool before frosting)., Now it’s time to decorate your cake. Decorate this cake the same day you serve it; the cake is moist so it tends to “soak up” the powdered sugar, plus the icing looks prettier fresh. To keep things neat, I like to do this part on a wire cooling rack with a piece of parchment paper underneath to catch extra sugar/ drips. You can simply do it on a plate if you prefer. First, put 3 tbsp of powdered sugar into a handheld mesh strainer or sifter. Sprinkle sugar onto the top of the cake by tapping the strainer or sifting to release an even shower of sugar around the surface of the cake., Next, make your drizzle icing.  Sift 1 cup of powdered sugar into a mixing bowl. Add ¼ tsp of vanilla extract and 1/2 tbsp water or non-dairy creamer to the bowl (when I first posted this recipe years ago I used non-dairy creamer, but I actually prefer using water now). Stir sugar and liquid with a whisk or fork to blend. The trick with this icing is to add liquid very slowly - you only want to add until it just comes together. Add additional liquid by half teaspoonfuls, mixing constantly, until the mixture has the texture of very thick honey. You want the icing to be quite thick. When you can pull a spatula through the icing, and it takes a few seconds for the gap in the icing to close again, the texture is right., Place a sealing bag (reusable or disposable) inside a tall water glass, open end facing upward and wrapped around the edge of the glass, so there is an open space for easy filling. Pour the icing into the bag., Close the bag, leaving a small bit open to vent. Guide the icing towards one of the lower corners of the bag. Cut the very tip of that corner off the bag., Drizzle the icing in a zig-zag pattern around the cake by squeezing the bag gently to release the glaze., Allow icing to dry completely before serving—this usually takes about 30-60 minutes.

Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl again, making sure the batter is evenly mixed., Transfer the batter to the prepared pans and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. Cool in the pans on a rack for 15 minutes, then unmold onto rack to finish cooling right side up (keep the parchment paper underneath the cake layers so they don't stick to the rack). When cake layers are completely cool, use a serrated knife to trim off the domed tops, if necessary; this will ensure the cake is level. Place one cake layer on a serving plate, cut side down. Using an offset spatula or butter knife, spread about ¾ cup of the frosting over the first layer. Top with the second layer, cut side down, then spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake, swirling decoratively. The cake is best enjoyed fresh on the day it is made, but it will keep nicely for 2 to 3 days stored in a cake dome at room temperature., Note: If you’d like to make your own buttermilk, check out the easy methodhere., Note: The recipe can also make 24 cupcakes (bake for 20 to 23 minutes) or a 9 x 13-inch sheet cake (bake for 30 to 35 minutes)., Note: Nutritional information includes the chocolate buttercream frosting., Freezer-Friendly Instructions: The cake can be frozen, without frosting, for up to 3 months. After it is completely cooled, double-wrap it securely with aluminum foil or plastic freezer wrap, or place it in heavy-duty freezer bag. Thaw overnight on the countertop and then frost before serving.","[('buttermilk', 1.0, 'cup'), ('eggs', 4.0, none), ('vanilla extract', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('cake flour', 2.75, 'cups'), ('granulated sugar', 2.0, 'cups'), ('baking soda', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('unsalted butter', 1.0, 'cup')]"

To Make the Dough: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a small or medium saucepan over medium heat, add the butter, 4 tablespoons of the sugar and the salt; stir. Once the butter has melted, add the sour cream and heat to luke warm, about 105 degrees. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, add ¼ cup warm water, yeast, and 1 tablespoon of the sugar; stir. Allow the yeast to sit for about five minutes until it bubbles and becomes active., 2. Once the yeast is active, whisk in the warm butter and sour cream mixture, the egg, and 1 cup of the flour. Whisk until smooth. Using an oiled wooden spoon, being mixing in small amounts of the remaining flour until you form a soft dough. This will take about another 2 cups of flour. You want the dough to be tacky, but not sticky., 3. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface lightly dusted with flour. With oiled hands, knead the dough until and elastic, about 5 to 10 minutes, adding more flour by the teaspoon if needed., 4. Place the ball of dough into a large, well-oiled bowl, then flip the dough so all of the surface area of the dough is oiled. Cover the bowl with oiled plastic wrap and a hand towel, then set the bowl in a warm, draft-free area and allow the dough to rise until it has doubled in size, about 1 hour., 5. While the dough is rising make the filling. Combine the melted butter, cinnamon and sugar in a medium bowl and stir to fully combine., 6. Once the dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Lightly flour the dough and a rolling pin. Roll the dough into a rectangle about 18 inches long by 14 inches wide., Spread the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the outside of the dough., 7. Roll the cake up jellyroll-style and pinch the seams shut., Carefully move the roll to a parchment-line baking sheet, seam-side down. Bring the ends together to form an oval and press the edges together to completely seal the cake into an oval., 8. Once again, cover the cake with oiled plastic wrap and a hand towel and allow it to rise for another 30 minutes., 9. During the second rise, make the colored sugars. Place ½ cup of superfine sugar into three separate bowls. Using the food coloring, make one bowl of green sugar, one bowl of yellow sugar, and one bowl of purple sugar (by mixing the blue and red). Use the back of a spoon or a pestle, work the food coloring into the sugar by grinding it against the side of the bowl and working the coloring throughout all of the sugar. Continue this until the sugar is uniform in color and there are no clumps. I used 12 drops of food coloring total for each of the colors., 10. Once 30 minutes have passed, remove the plastic wrap and hand towel from the cake and bake in the upper third of the oven for about 25 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown. Immediately transfer the cake to a cooling rack after removing it from the oven. Allow the cake to cool for at least 20 minutes before icing the cake., 11. Once the cake has cooled for 15 minutes, make the icing. Whisk together the powdered sugar, salt, vanilla, melted butter and milk until smooth. You want the icing to be able to drizzle easily but not just run right off the cake, so if the icing is to thin, just whisk in more powdered sugar and if the icing is too thick whisk in a touch more milk. After the cake has had a chance to cool, move the cake to whatever platter you wish to serve it on. (At this point, stick a dried bean or little plastic baby into the cake through the bottom. It's tradition in Louisiana that whoever gets the baby has to spring for the next cake! Elsewhere, it's a sign of good luck.) Slide pieces of wax paper under the cake so that it can catch any icing or sugar drips., 12. Drizzle the icing evenly over the cake and allow it ooze down the sides. Before the icing has a chance to set, sprinkle on rotating strips of colored sugar. Slide the wax paper pieces out from under the cake and discard. King cake can be served warm or at room temperature.","[('butter', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('sour cream', 8.0, 'ounces'), ('sugar', 5.0, 'tablespoons'), ('salt', 1.0, 'pinch'), ('active dry yeast', 2.25, 'teaspoons'), ('warm water', 0.25, 'cup'), ('egg', 1.0, none), ('all-purpose flour', 3.0, 'cups'), ('oil', 1.0, none)]"

You can use a skewer and poke the middle - you’ll want to see some wet crumbs but not wet batter.

Loosen the edges of the cakes using an offset spatula or butter knife, and flip the cakes out onto a cooling rack so you can peel off the parchment bottom. I then usually trim the domes off (if you want) and then wrap my cakes in plastic wrap until I’m ready to frost.

Line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper and lightly grease the bottom and sides with nonstick cooking spray., For the brownies, in a medium microwave-safe bowl (or in a pan on the stovetop), melt the butter, sugar and cocoa powder at 1-minute intervals, stirring in between, until the butter is completely melted and the mixture is well-combined., Let the mixture cool to warm room temperature. Stir in the salt and vanilla. Add the eggs and mix until the batter is thick and smooth. Stir in the flour until combined. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan and bake for 30-40 minutes until the brownie is set around the edges and only moist crumbs come out when a toothpick is inserted in the center (not wet batter). Remove the pan from the oven and let the brownies cool completely (in the pan)., Top the cooled brownie layer with about 20-22 of the mini Reese’s peanut butter cups that have been cut in half (so about 40 halves total on top of the brownie layer)., For the peanut butter mousse, in a large bowl with an electric handheld mixer (or in an electric stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment), whip the cream cheese and powdered sugar together until smooth and lump-free. Add the peanut butter and vanilla and mix until lightly and creamy, 1-2 minutes. Add 1 cup of the heavy cream and mix, starting on low speed so it doesn’t splatter everywhere, mix until well-combined. Add the remaining cup of cream and mix until the mixture is very thick, 4-5 minutes (UPDATE: according to many of your comments and depending on the type of mixer you are using, this may be too long! Stop mixing after it gets thick, even if it’s only after a minute or so). Dollop large spoonfuls of the peanut butter mousse over the mini peanut butter cups and brownie layer. Spread into an even layer. Refrigerate while making the chocolate mousse., For the chocolate mousse, melt the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl at 1-minute intervals, 50% power, until melted and smooth. Set aside to cool completely., In a large bowl (I use the same one as the peanut butter mousse after I’ve quickly wiped it clean) with an electric handheld mixer (or in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment), whip together the cream cheese and sugar until smooth and lump-free. Add the vanilla extract and 1 cup of the heavy cream and mix, starting on slow speed so it doesn’t splatter, until smooth, 1 minute or so. Add the rest of the heavy cream and mix until thick and fluffy, 4-5 minutes., When the chocolate is completely cool (this is critical! If it’s warm at all, it will make the mixture soupy – it should still be melted but cool to the touch), fold it into the whipped cream mixture using a large spoon or rubber spatula to gently stir the mixture up and over until it is well-combined. Whisking too quickly might deflate the whipped cream mixture., Spread the chocolate mousse evenly over the peanut butter mousse. Cover the pan with plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate the cake for at least 2 hours (or up to overnight)., Run a long thin knife under hot water and wipe clean. Run the knife around the edge of the brownies to loosen from the sides of the pan. Undo the springform pan and lift off the sides. You can serve the cake on the base of the springform pan or use a wide spatula in between the parchment and pan bottom to lift off the cake and place on a serving platter., For the ganache, combine the chocolate and cream in a microwave-safe bowl (you can do this in a pan on the stovetop) and microwave at 1-minute intervals, stirring in between, until the mixture is glossy and smooth (it should only take a minute or so in the microwave). Let the mixture cool slightly so it isn’t super hot but is still pourable – slightly warm room temperature is fine. Pour the ganache over the top of the cake; it doesn’t need to cover the entire top and it’s ok if it drizzles down the side. It should look a bit rustic., Pile any extra peanut butter cups in the middle of the ganache. Refrigerate for an hour or so (or serve right away, the ganache will be a little soft and messy, but that’s ok). Use a long thin knife to cut into thin slices (running it under hot water and wiping clean can help with neat slices) for serving.","[('butter', 10.0, 'tablespoons'), ('sugar', 1.25, 'cups'), ('cocoa powder', 0.75, 'cups'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('vanilla extract', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('eggs', 2.0, none), ('flour', 0.5, 'cup'), ('peanut butter cups', 12.0, 'ounce')]"

When it hits that point, you've rolled enough. Next, grab a golf-ball size handful of dough and roll it into a ball. Using your thumb, gently make an imprint in the middle of the ball so that it forms a tart shape which can hold a topping. Repeat with the rest of the dough.

Add the honey, olive oil, and water.  Place on mixer and mix briefly to incorporate.  Turn the mixer up to medium high and knead for 5 minutes.  Remove the dough hook and scrape the dough into a cohesive mass using a plastic dough scraper or a rubber spatula (or scrape into another bowl).  Cover and place the bowl in a warm, draft-free area and allow it to rise (proof) for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in volume., Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight, but up to 10 days., On baking day, remove the dough from refrigerator and dump it out onto well-floured surface.  Knead until fairly smooth, adding more flour as necessary.  If not using the psyllium husks, it will be a somewhat sticky dough so keep a small bowl of flour on hand to sprinkle the dough and/or surface with extra flour., To shape into a boule, simply form into a round ball, pulling the dough up and under the ball and pinching on the bottom.  Place on parchment paper.  To shape into a baguette, smooth the dough and roll into a rope shape, tapering it at the ends, adding more flour as necessary.  Roll out as thick or thin as you'd like and as long as you're able to fit in your oven (make sure it will fit on your pizza steel or stone).  Place it on a sheet of parchment paper., Place the loaf or loaves, covered loosely with plastic wrap, in a warm, draft-free area to rise until visibly puffed and slightly larger, but not doubled in size, about ½ to 1 hour.  This time will vary depending on the warmth of your proofing area., BAKING STEEL OR STONE METHOD:  Set up your oven for baking.  Place a baking steel or stone (or overturned baking sheet) onto the middle rack with a shallow pan on a rack underneath.  Preheat the oven to 450° F., DUTCH OVEN METHOD:  Place a Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid into the oven and preheat it to 500° F.  You won't need the shallow pan with steam as enough steam will be created in the Dutch oven once the bread goes in.  NOTE:  This will only work with boules or loaves that can fit into the Dutch oven.  If you're making a longer batard or baguette, you'll need to use the first method., When the dough has finished rising and is visibly puffed, run a serrated knife under hot tap water and cut slits in the dough swiftly but uniformly, about ½-¾ inch deep., BAKING STEEL OR STONE METHOD:  Fill a measuring cup with one cup of very hot water (from the tap is fine).  Using a pizza peel (paddle), slide the loaf (or loaves) onto the baking steel (or stone), parchment and all.   Immediately pour the cup of very hot tap water into the shallow pan.  Quickly shut the oven door., DUTCH OVEN METHOD:  Remove the lid carefully and carefully lower the dough, parchment and all, into the Dutch oven.  Replace the lid and shut the oven door.  Immediately reduce the temperature down to 450° F., BAKING STEEL OR STONE METHOD:  Bake for about 30 minutes for baguettes, or about 40 minutes for boules, OR longer for larger boules (some larger boules can take up to an HOUR or more).  If the loaves are getting too browned, you can cover them loosely with foil.  The loaves will look crusty and done on the outside, but willfeel lightwhen picked up.  If they feel heavy, they're not done yet.  Allow them to bake for another 5-10 minutes and then check again, picking up the loaf with two gloved hands.  If they're still feeling heavy, allow them to bake for another 5 minutes and check again., DUTCH OVEN METHOD:  Bake the bread for 40 minutes with the lid on.  Remove the cover and continue to bake for another 20 minutes.   Check for doneness by picking up the loaf (with gloved hands).  If the loaf feels relatively light for its size, it's done.  If it feels at all heavy, it's not done and give it another 5-10 minutes before checking again., Remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack.  Allow to cool COMPLETELY before cutting (or it will be gummy on the inside).","[(""kim's gluten free bread flour blend"", 420.0, ""g""), (""xanthan gum"", 1.5, ""teaspoon""), (""psyllium husks"", 5.0, ""g""), (""instant/rapid rise/fast-acting yeast"", 9.0, ""g""), (""kosher salt"", 1.0, ""teaspoon""), (""water"", 420.0, ""ml""), (""olive oil"", 26.0, ""ml""), (""honey"", 21.0, ""g"")]"
