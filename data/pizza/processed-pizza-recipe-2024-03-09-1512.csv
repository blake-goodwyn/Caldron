Add two more teaspoons of water if the dough feels a little dry. You do not need to form a ball of dough, or bother with making it smooth. Simply mix it up, making sure all the flour is moistened, cover with clingfilm and leave to rise at room temperature for 12 to 16 hours., After 12 to 16 hours, the dough should have doubled, look fermented and have bubbles on the base and smell slightly sour. It should also feel very soft and sticky and a little wet. In hot weather, it is best to put the bowl in the fridge if you're not ready to bake yet, to prevent the dough from getting over fermented once it has doubled, although make sure you don't postpone the baking beyond a couple of hours., About half an hour before you begin forming the dough into pizzas, preheat the oven to 250 C (usually its highest temp, as the oven needs to be hot hot hot) and lightly flour a non-stick baking pan. If you don't have one, line your baking tray wth a silicone mat as this dough tends to stick., While the oven is preheating, get your toppings ready., Now, cut the dough into two and scrape one half out onto the prepared pan using floured fingertips., Stretch and pull the dough to a roughly round shape, about 10 inches wide. It will be sticky and a little hard to work with, but it does work out in the end. You can also make a rectangular pizza, shape no bar! Don't stretch the dough too thin, because it needs to be able to hold the toppings., Spread half the pizza sauce on the base, leaving about half an inch of a border on the edge of the dough. Top with half of the mushrooms and veggies, scattering them in an even layer over the sauce. Turn the edges of the dough up to form a crust., Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until the crust has browned lightly and the veggies have roasted and blistered slightly. Rotate the tray as needed if one side is browning more than the other. Now top with half the cheese, and bake for 5 to 10 minutes until it is melted through, making sure you don't let it get too brown or it might lose its stretchiness. At this point the edges of the pizza will also brown further and become crispy. Slice and serve hot hot hot. Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings.

If you happen to have a double oven and two pizza stones, greatâ¦if not youâll have to cook one pizza at a time., While the dough is rising and oven is heating up prepare your pizza sauce and toppings. (See my Easy No Cook Pizza Sauce recipe), When the dough is ready, transfer to a lightly floured counter. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and sprinkle each with flour. Using your fingertips, form each half into a small round disk, about 7-8 inches. Then using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into about 12 inch circles, using additional flour as needed., Sprinkle your pizza peel with corn meal. If you donât have a pizza peel, sprinkle a sheet of parchment paper with cornmeal. Transfer the dough to the peel ensuring that the dough will slide on the cornmealâ¦if not, add a little more cornmeal. If using parchment you can leave the pizza on the parchment paper though out the cooking process. Add about Â½ cup pizza sauce, your desired toppings, and about 6 ounces (1 Â½ cups) of mozzarella cheese (preferably, freshly gratedâ¦it melts better)., When itâs topped the way you like it, make sure the pizza will still slide on your peel/pan. If not lift up the edge of the pizza and toss some more corn meal under the dough. Next, slide your pizza onto the hot pizza stone. Depending on the type of stone you have it may be easier to get the stone out of the oven and set it on the stove top rather than trying to slide the pizza into the oven. If using parchment, add the pizza on the parchment directly on top of the pizza stone. The parchment method is a little easier and less messy...but, whatever works best for you., The pizza will need to cook 12-15 minutes, depending on how dark you like your pizza. We like ours well browned on the top and the edges dark and crispyâ¦.just like at Vito and Nickâs. Let the pizza cool for a few minutes and then slice into squares, top with Parmesan and crushed red peppers if desired and enjoy!","[('flour', 2.5, 'cups'), ('sugar', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('instant yeast', 1.5, 'teaspoons'), ('salt', 1.0, 'teaspoons'), ('water', 0.75, 'cups'), ('water', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('extra virgin olive oil', 2.0, 'tablespoons')]"

3fc9b503,https://thefoodcharlatan.com/homemade-pizza-recipe/,Homemade Pizza Recipe,"1 16 ounce ball of pizza dough (12 to 16 ounces is fine), 1 tablespoon olive oil (for rubbing dough), 1 cup pizza sauce, 3 ounces thinly sliced mozzarella cheese, 5 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese (about 1 and 1/4 cups), 2.5 ounces pepperoni (about half a 5 oz package ), 2 tablespoons shredded parmesan cheese","NOTE: The ingredient list has the amount of toppings you need to make one 12-inch pizza. If you followed my pizza dough recipe, you will have 2 balls of dough. If you want to make them both right away, be sure to double the topping ingredients shown here. Place a pizza stone in the bottom third of your oven. (place a rimmed baking sheet or a pizza pan in the oven if you don't have a stone.), Preheat your oven to 550 degrees F, or as high as it will go (at least 475.) Let the stone preheat for 30 minutes. I don't care when your oven beeps to tell you it's at temperature. Set a timer, 30 minutes at least!, Prepare a work surface. I prefer to rub my counter with oil, but you can lightly dust it with flour if you have a very sticky dough. (Too much flour can turn your dough tough.), Roll out the dough. Place your ball of pizza dough in the center of your prepared work surface and use your hands to press it down, starting from the center. Keep gently patting out the dough, moving the dough outward from the center. I usually use my hands for pizza dough, gently patting and stretching (and yes, picking it up and maybe even tossing!), but you can also use a rolling pin. Make sure to keep rotating the pin so that you get a roughly circular shape. It doesn't have to be perfect! Even if you have used a rolling pin, I like to use my fingers afterward to shape the edges into a thicker crust. See photos. Continue patting and stretching the dough gently with your hands until it is about 12 inches across., Transfer the dough to a square of parchment paper. I highly recommend using parchment paper because itâs SO much easier transferring your pizza into the oven. You can pick it up carefully with your hands and rearrange it on the paper, or wrap it around your rolling pin to help transfer. (I've tried rolling the dough out directly onto parchment paper. It doesn't work well.) Make sure you stretch out the dough so that it is about 12 inches.Drizzle about a tablespoon of olive oil over the top of your dough. Use your hands or a pastry brush to rub the oil all over the top of the dough, especially the edges of the crust. This layer of oil helps provide a barrier between the toppings and the dough, helping it cook more evenly.If you love a thicker crust pizza, let the rolled-out dough rest for 10 minutes. You can skip this rest no problem., Par bake. Once the oven is up to temperature, we are going to do a 1 to 2 minute par bake. This step is technically not necessary, but I never skip it. It guarantees not only a thoroughly cooked crust, but a nice and crispy one. Nobody wants a doughy pizza, yuck. (If you want to skip it, you can proceed with topping your pizza). Pulling on the edge of the parchment paper, slide your pizza dough onto your pizza peel or flat baking sheet. Open the oven and pull on the parchment paper again to slide the pizza dough and the parchment paper onto the hot hot pizza stone (or pizza pan). Your whole body is basically inside the oven during this procedure so please be careful and make sure there are no toddlers running around who could climb right in and burn to death (these are the thoughts that keep me up at night).Shut the oven door and par bake for 1-2 minutes, until the dough is slightly puffed. Set a timer, don't walk away!Pull on the parchment paper again to transfer the half-baked dough back onto your pizza peel. Keep the oven door shut as much as possible so you don't lose heat. Poke down any large bubbles on your crust., Top your pizza. Leave the crust on the peel while you add your toppings. Add 1 cup of pizza sauce (I like to spread it around with a ladle). Add 3 ounces thinly sliced mozzarella, and then top with 5 ounces of shredded mozzarella. I like a lot of cheese and this is about the max amount you can add without weighing down your pizza so much that it doesn't cook all the way through. This isn't the Bible, you can eyeball the amounts on cheese, just keep in mind there is a limit if you want a properly cooked pizza. Add about a half package of pepperoni (or olives, mushrooms, ham and pineapple, sausage, red onions, or literally any toppings you want. See post for ideas.) Sprinkle 2 tablespoons shredded parmesan cheese over your toppings., Bake the pizza. (See note if you don't have a pizza stone*) Transfer the pizza back onto the pizza stone (or pan), this time without the parchment paper. You want the pizza to do its final bake directly on the stone. (The stone is porous and absorbs moisture, giving you a crispier crust.) Your crust is sturdy enough after the 1-2 minute par bake that it shouldn't be too hard to push the pizza onto the stone without the paper. Bake the pizza for about 8-12 minutes. This is going to depend on how hot your oven is, and how thick your pizza is. The edges of the crust should be golden brown, and the cheese should be bubbly and also starting to lightly brown. If you don't have a pizza stone, use a spatula to lift the edge of your pizza to make sure that it is browning all across the center on bottom. If the bottom is still white, you are looking at a doughy pizza. No thanks. Leave it in longer.If the top of your pizza is browning too quickly but the bottom crust isn't done, tent the top of the pizza with foil to slow browning., Remove your pizza from the oven using the pizza peel. Slide it directly onto a cooling rack to help keep that bottom crust from getting soggy. Let cool a couple minutes, then transfer to a cutting board. Slice into 8 pieces and devour!","[('pizza dough', 1.0, 'ball'), ('olive oil', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('pizza sauce', 1.0, 'cup'), ('mozzarella cheese', 3.0, 'ounces'), ('mozzarella cheese', 5.0, 'ounces'), ('pepperoni', 2.5, 'ounces'), ('parmesan cheese', 2.0, 'tablespoons')]"

Return to kneading after 30 minutes and make sure to knead the dough for at least 5 minutes total., Place the bowl over the dough once more and let sit for 30-40 minutes to warm up., Divide the dough into 4 equal-sized balls, weighing them to ensure they are roughly 345 grams (or 12 ounces) each., Pull the dough towards its end repeatedly to form a smooth ball.

Add the warm water and olive oil, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together. It will seem shaggy and dry, but donât worry., Scrape the dough onto a well-floured counter top and knead the dough for three minutes. It should quickly come together and begin to get sticky. Dust the dough with flour as needed (sometimes I will have to do this 2 to 3 times, depending on humidity levels) â it should be slightly tacky, but should not be sticking to your counter top. After about 3 minutes, the dough should be smooth, slightly elastic, and tacky. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil, and place the dough into the bowl., Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or plastic wrap) and allow the dough to rise in a warm, dry area of your kitchen for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size. Proofing Tip: If your kitchen is very cold, heat a large heatproof measuring cup of water in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. This creates a nice warm environment. Remove the cup and place the bowl with the dough in the microwave until it has risen. [If you are preparing the dough in advance, see the note section for freezing instructions.], Preheat Oven and Pizza Steel or Stone: Place the pizza steel (or stone) on the second to top rack of your oven (roughly 8 inches from the broiler element), and preheat the oven and steel (or stone) to 550Â°F (285Â°C) for a minumum of 1 hour. If your oven does not go up to 550Â°F (285Â°C) or you are using a delicate pizza stone, I recommend heating it to a maximum of 500Â°F (260Â°C), As the oven is preheating, assemble the ingredients. In a small bowl, stir together the pureed tomatoes, minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pepper, and salt. Set aside another small bowl with the cubed mozzarella cheese (pat the cheese with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture). Set aside the basil leaves and grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese for easy grabbing., Separate the dough into two equal-sized portions. It will deflate slightly, but that is OK. Place the dough on a large plate or floured counter top, cover gently with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes., Assemble the Pizza: Sprinkle the pizza peel (if you do not own a pizza peel, you can try using the back of a half sheet pan - but it is tricky!) with a tablespoon of semolina and dusting of all-purpose flour. Gently use both hands to stretch one ball of pizza dough into roughly a 10-inch circle (donât worry if its not perfectly uniform). If the dough springs back or is too elastic, allow it to rest for an additional five minutes. The edges of the dough can be slightly thicker, but make sure the center of the dough is thin (you should be able to see some light through it if you held it up). Gently transfer the dough onto the semolina and flour dusted pizza peel or baking sheet., Drizzle or brush the dough lightly (using your fingertips) with olive oil (roughly a teaspoon. Using a large spoon, add roughly Â½ cup of the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, leaving a Â½-inch or Â¾-inch border on all sides. Use the back of the spoon to spread it evenly and thinly. Sprinkle a tablespoon of parmigiano-reggiano cheese onto the pizza sauce. Add half of the cubed mozzarella, distributing it evenly over the entire pizza. Using your hands, tear a few large basil leaves, and sprinkle the basil over the pizza. At this point, Iâll occasionally stretch the sides of the dough out a bit to make it even thinner. Gently slide the pizza from the peel onto the heated baking stone. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and caramelized and the edges of the pizza are golden brown. Note: If you're looking for more color, finish the pizza under the low or medium broil setting, but watch it carefully! Remove the pizza carefully from the oven with the pizza peel, transfer to a wooden cutting board or foil, drizzle the top with olive oil, some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and chiffonade of fresh basil. Slice and serve immediately and/or prepare the second pizza., Serving Tip: If youâre serving two pizzas at once, I recommend placing the cooked pizza on a separate baking sheet while you prepare the other pizza. In the last few minutes of cooking, place the prepared pizza into the oven (on a rack below the pizza stone) so that it is extra hot for serving. Otherwise, I recommend serving one pizza fresh out of the oven, keeping the oven hot, and preparing the second pizza after people have gone through the first one! The pizza will taste great either way, but it is at its prime within minutes out of the oven!.","[('flour', 300, 'g'), ('sugar', 1, 'teaspoon'), ('yeast', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', 0.75, 'teaspoon'), ('water', 7, 'ounces'), ('olive oil', 1, 'tablespoon'), ('tomatoes', 1, 'cup'), ('garlic', 2-3, 'cloves'), ('salt', 2-3, 'pinches'), ('pepper', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('cheese', 2-3, 'tablespoons'), ('mozzarella cheese', 7, 'ounces'), ('basil leaves', 5-6, 'leaves')]"

Add the water. Using a rubber spatula, mix until the liquid is absorbed and the ingredients form a sticky dough ball. Rub the surface of the dough lightly with olive oil. If your bowl has a lid, cover the bowl. Alternatively, transfer the dough to a vessel with a lid or cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to ensure the dough doesnât dry out in the fridge., Transfer dough to the fridge for at least 18 hours but ideally longer: 24 to 48 hours. Longer is fine, too: Iâve kept the dough in the fridge for 3 days before proceeding., Grease a 12â³ x 18â³ sheet pan with butter. Pour 2 tablespoons of olive oil into the center of the pan. (Note: This greasing step may seem excessive, but with some pans, it is imperative to do so to prevent sticking. Moreover, it adds flavor and helps brown the bottom crust perfectly.), Remove the dough from the fridge and use lightly oiled hands to release it from the sides of the bowl. Then, again with oiled hands, grab an edge of dough and pull up and to the center. Turn the bowl slightly and repeat until youâve shaped the dough into a rough ball., Place the dough ball in the pan and turn to coat. (Note: You do not need to cover the dough here. The coating of oil should be sufficient to prevent the dough from drying out.) Let rest for 3 hours. With lightly oiled hands, stretch the dough to fit the pan â tent your hands, and use your fingers to dimple and stretch. You will likely not be able to get the dough to stretch all the way to the edges. When the dough resists, let it rest again for 30 minutes; then stretch it again using the same technique., At this point, the dough can hang out in the pan for a couple of hours (if your kitchen is on the cool side). Iâve baked it 30 minutes after this point, and Iâve baked it two hours later. If the dough is going to hang out for a while, cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap., If you have a Baking Steel or pizza stone, place it on a rack in the middle or lower third of your oven, and heat your oven to 500ÂºF., Using oiled hand, dimple the dough one last time with the exception of the perimeter â this is important. It will help the dough bake more evenly., Transfer pan to the oven and place on heated Baking Steel or pizza stone for about 10 to 11 minutes or until evenly golden., Remove pan from oven and lower the oven to 475ÂºF. (Note: my oven doesnât change temperature so quickly, so I actually turn the oven off during this period. Just before I return the pan to the oven, I turn the oven back on to 475ÂºF. Also: You can do this parbake hours ahead of time or even a day ahead of time.), For the veggie pizza, In a large skillet over high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. When it shimmers, add the mushrooms and let cook undisturbed for about a minute. Season with salt; then stir. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until the mushrooms are beginning to brown. Transfer to a bowl. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the skillet; then add the peppers and mushrooms. Cook for 1 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Season with salt; then transfer to the bowl with the mushrooms. Toss to combine. Taste and adjust with salt as needed. Spread this mixture over the cheese. Add some sliced pepperoni if you wish., For the pepperoni pizza, Arrange the sliced pepperoni over the cheese., For the pepperoni + pickled jalapeÃ±o pizza, Arrange the sliced pepperoni and pickled jalapeÃ±os over the cheese., Transfer pan to the oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the cheese is melted and just beginning to brown in spots., Remove the pan from the oven and let the pizza rest for 5 minutes in the pan. If you are making a pepperoni pizza and are using the crushed red pepper flakes, sprinkle some of the pepper flakes over the top. If you are using the hot honey for the pickled jalapeÃ±o pizza, drizzle some over the top., Run a knife or spatula around the panâs edges. Then, carefully remove the entire pizza from the pan, transferring it to a cutting board. I like to use a serrated knife to cut this pizza. You can cut the pizza into however many pieces you wish.

For best results and ease of mind, read through the recipe completely before beginning. You will need two deep dish 9Ã2-inch round cake pans if you are making both pizzas at the same time. You can also use 9-inch springform pans., For the crust, Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, and yeast in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. If you do not have a stand mixer, use your hand mixer and a very very large bowl. If you do not have any mixer, you will do this all by hand. Again, use a very large bowl. Give those ingredients a quick toss with your mixer on low or with a large wooden spoon. Add the warm water and 1/4 cup of melted butter. The warm water should be around 90Â°F (32Â°C). Make sure it is not very, very hot or it will kill the yeast. Likewise, make sure the butter isnât boiling hot. If you melt it in the microwave, let it sit for 5 minutes before adding. On low speed, beat (or stir) the dough ingredients until everything begins to be moistened. Continuing on low speed (or remove from the bowl and knead by hand if you do not own a mixer), beat the dough until it is soft and supple and gently pulls away from the sides of the bowl and falls off of the dough hook- about 4-5 minutes. If the dough is too hard (it will be textured from the cornmeal), but if it feels too tough, beat in 1 teaspoon of warm water. Alternatively, if it feels too soft, beat in 1 Tablespoon of flour., Remove the dough from the bowl and form into a ball. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning it around so that all sides of the dough are coated in the oil. Cover the bowl tightly with aluminum foil and allow to rise in a warm environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size., Once the dough is ready, lightly flour a large work surface. Remove dough from the bowl, set the bowl and aluminum foil aside (to use later). Gently punch down the dough to remove any air bubbles and roll the dough into a large 15Ã12-inch rectangle. Spread 1/4 cup of softened butter on top of the dough. Roll it up lengthwise per the photos below. Cut the dough log in half. Form the two pieces of dough into balls and place back into your greased bowl. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rise in the refrigerator (not in a warm place) for 1 hour until they are puffy as you make the sauce., For the sauce, Place butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and allow it to melt. Once melted, add the grated onion, salt, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Once the onion has slightly browned after about 5 minutes, add the garlic, tomatoes, and sugar. Turn the heat down to low-medium and allow it to simmer until itâs hearty, fragrant, and thick- about 30 minutes. Youâll have about 2 and 1/2 cups of sauce at this point. If you have more than that, keep simmering until the amount has reduced. Remove from heat and set aside until ready to be used. You may store the sauce in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days if planning to make the pizza another day. You may freeze this sauce for up to 2 months as well., Preheat oven to 425Â°F (218Â°C)., Assemble the pizzas, After the dough balls have risen in the refrigerator, they should be puffy. Keep one ball of dough in the refrigerator as you work with the first one. Roll it out on a lightly floured work surface, working it into a 12-inch circle. Using your rolling pin as a guide (see photos below), place over a 9Ã2-inch deep dish cake pan. Using your fingers, press the dough into the cake pan. Make sure it is nice and tight fitting inside the pan. Trim any excess dough off the edges with a small knife. Repeat with 2nd dough. Brush the top edges of the dough with a little olive oil, which gives the crust a beautiful sheen. Fill each pizza with 1/2 of the cheese (about 2 cups/8 oz per pizza), then the pepperoni and bacon or your desired toppings. Pour about 1 and 1/4 cups (300ml) of sauce evenly on top of each. If you do not like that much sauce, you can reduce to 3/4 cup (180ml) per pizza and have leftover sauce. Sprinkle each with 1/4 cup (22g) of grated parmesan cheese., Place the cake pans on top of a large baking sheet, which will catch anything potentially spilling over the sides of the pans. (Nothing usually does.) Bake for 20-28 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Feel free to loosely cover the pizzas with aluminum foil after the 15 minute mark to prevent any heavy browning and uneven baking. Remove the pizzas from the oven and allow to cool in the pans placed on a wire rack for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, slice, serve, and enjoy. Place any leftover pizza in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days.

Cover the bowl or dough bucket tightly and let it rise for at least 8 but up to 24 hours., Pour 2 tablespoons of neutral oil into a 10 to 12 inch cast-iron skillet. Repeat with a second skillet. Swirl to coat the bottoms of the pans. Divide the risen dough into two pieces. Gently form into a ball by pulling the side of the dough and tucking it under, rotating 1/4 turn and repeating the tug and tug, rotating another 1/4 turn and repeating the tug and tuck, then finally doing it once more to form a loose ball. Lay it smooth side down in the oil, then flip so the whole thing is coated in oil. Use the palm of your hand to gently flatten the dough. It will not spread to the edges yet, but that is okay. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap and set out at room temperature -undisturbed- for 2 hours., To Prepare the Pizzas:, Preheat oven as high as it will go, preferably to 550Â°F. Remove plastic wrap from the pans with the pizza dough in them. The dough should now have spread itself (or nearly spread itself) to the edges of the pan. Simply lift the edges of dough to pull toward the sides of the pan if necessary. This will help loosen any trapped air under the dough as well. If there are any large air bubbles, nudge them down with the back of a knuckle., Spread half of the sauce on each pizza right to the edges of the dough. Divide the cheese and top each pizza evenly to the edge, then distribute the pepperoni over the pizzas. If using it, tear half of your basil leaves and toss over the tops of the pizzas. Reserve half of the basil to add to the pizzas when they're removed from the oven., Put into the hot oven and bake for 12-20 minutes (depending on how well done you want your pizzas.) You can check the underside of the pizza crust for doneness by lifting the edge gently with a flexible spatula (like a fish turner). A finished pizza will have a crisp, deep-brown bottom and a bubbly, golden- to deep-golden brown top. I pull my pizzas when the edges have some deeply caramelized (read: lightly charred) edges and some dark brown bubbles on top., Use your flexible spatula to slide under the pizza and edge it out onto a cutting board, tear the remaining basil and scatter over the pizzas.

Set aside., In a very large bowl or 12-quart round tub, add the flour (7Â¾c.) and slowly add 3-4 cups of warm water in, just until the mixture comes together., Mix by hand just until incorporated. Cover and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes on your counter., Sprinkle the salt over the top of the dough. Then pour the yeast mixture over the dough. Use a small piece of the mixture to wipe the remaining yeast goop from its container, then throw it back in the tub., Bring the bowl next to the sink and turn on a slow trickle of warm water. Mix the dough by hand, wetting your working hand before mixing so the dough doesnât stick to you. (Itâs fine to rewet your hand three or four times while you mix.) Mix well until incorporated., Reach underneath the dough and grab about one-quarter of it. Gently stretch this section of dough and fold it over the top of the other side of the dough. Repeat three more times with the remaining dough, until the salt and yeast are fully enclosed., Fold the dough repeatedly, rotating and folding, working through the entire mass of dough. Do this for 5 minutes. Let rest for 30 minutes., After 30 minutes, fold the dough again, by grabbing the edges and stretching them up and into the center. Fold about 4 times. Then lightly coat the dough and the bottom of the tub with olive oil to help prevent sticking. Let it rest, covered at room temperature, for 5-6 hours, or until doubled. When the dough is about double its original volume, itâs ready to be divided., Divide. Moderately flour a work surface about 2 feet wide. With floured hands, gently ease the dough out of the tub. With your hands still floured, pick up the dough and ease it back down onto the work surface in a somewhat even shape. Dust the entire top of the dough with flour, then using a large knife or bench scraper, cut it into 6 equal-size pieces., Shape each piece of the dough into balls. You will end up with 6 balls. Gently fold it into a ball, then very carefully roll it along the counter to seal the bottom. Be careful not to knead it - you don't want to deflate the dough. Gently form the 6 balls., After each ball is formed, place it into a piece of plastic wrap that is sprayed with cooking spray or lightly oiled, to prevent from sticking.Seal each dough ball in the plastic wrap (be gentle with the dough as you do it). Place all 6 balls of wrapped dough onto a large baking sheet and place in the fridge., Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to make the dough easier to shape., Once the dough has refrigerated, you are now ready to prep it for the oven.To prep for the pizza put the pizza stone in the oven and heat to 550Â°F or the hottest your oven will go (heat it on the BAKE feature, not broil). (If it only goes to 500Â°F that's fine, you'll just bake it a little longer.), Red Sauce, Pulse all sauce ingredients quickly in a blender. It doesn't need to be too finely pureed., Forming the Pizza, Remove the dough ball from the refrigerator, put it on a floured work surface and gently pat it down a bit to coat the bottom with flour. Flip and coat the other side with flour as well., Gently stretch and turn the dough repeatedly, still letting the bottom of the dough pull down, expanding the surface. Keep a close eye on the thickness of the dough. You want it thin, but you donât want it to tear or develop holes. If you end up with a small tear, donât panic â itâs OK to patch it., Using your fingertips, press outward on the dough until it forms a 10-14 inch pizza. Leave the outside 1 inch of the dough's outer rim thicker to be your crust., Be sure to flour your pizza peel well, so the pizza dough doesn't stick. Add the dough onto the floured pizza peel and run your hands around the perimeter to shape it into a round and work out the kinks., Add pizza toppings starting with red sauce, then fresh mozzarella. Be sure to tear or cut your fresh mozzarella into thin pieces - it gets goopy if it's too thick. Sparsely place the fresh mozzarella around the rest of the dough - you want spaces of red sauce in between the cheese to get an even amount without too much cheese., Add any additional toppings you'd like - we love adding fresh basil leaves before baking - they get sweet and crispy when cooked. You can also add fresh basil after the pizza comes out. Oregano, fresh parmesan, pepperoni, and sausage are also great on these pizzas. Keep it simple though, so the delicious sauce and crust can still be tasted., Cooking the Pizza, Once your pizza is topped, slide dough off pizza peel into oven (onto pizza stone - leave stone in the oven).

Hopefully the dough will slowly release and drop into the Sicilian pan. If not, use a bench scraper to gently pry it out., When dough is in oiled Sicilian pan, flip it over to coat it on all sides with oilâtrying to maintain rectangular shape the entire time. Press it out as evenly as possible into the corners of the pan.If the dough is snapping back, let it rest 10â15 minutes and try again. The point of cold-fermenting it in the sheet pan is to give you a head start on making a nice, easy, extensible rectangle shape.Temperature plays a role in ease of stretching, too. Cold dough is very hard to stretch and shape. Hence the warm-up in the sheet pan before transfer to the Sicilian pan., Let the dough rise in the pan until it's near double in bulkâit will be near the rim. Pay attention the first 30â45 minutes to see if it's receding from the edges. If it is, gently stretch it out as much as you can without handling it so much or so roughly that you de-gas the dough.When dough is near the top of the rim, sprinkle it with half the grated cheese, going heavy with it around the edges. This isn't a Detroit-style pizza, but I like a nice Parm-y edge., Lay sliced mozzarella atop dough, covering dough in its entirety but for 1/4"" around the edge. (This isn't a Detroit-style pizza, after all.) I like to double-layer a few extra slices on for extra cheesiness here and there., Spoon sauce on and use the back of a large spoon or ladle to spread it around. (I actually use an Asian soup spoon; its flat bottom is great for this purpose.) Sprinkle on the remaining half of the Parm/Romano., Place your panned-up pizza directly on the Baking Steel, and bake until dough edges are dark brown and pulling away from pan edges, 10â12 minutes, rotating halfway through., Remove pizza from oven and, using a spatula (or two), pry it from the pan and transfer it to the half-sheet and cooling rack.Allow to cool a few minutes and slice.Optional: Swirl on some olive oil, sprinkle on oregano, scissor on some fresh basil, and grate some fresh grana padano over it.","[('dough', 1.0, 'portion'), ('olive oil', 40.0, 'gram'), ('mozzarella', 340.0, 'gram'), ('parmesan', 70.0, 'gram'), ('pizza sauce', 16.0, 'ounce'), ('oregano', None, None), ('basil leaves', None, None), ('grana padano', None, None)]"

Add flour until you canât mix it by hand very well., Sprinkle some flour on your table and turn the dough onto the table. Knead the dough by hand until it is smooth and elastic, adding flour as needed. This should take 6 to 10 minutes of kneading. You can also do this part in a stand mixer if you have one., Place the dough back in the bowl, cover it with a towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 15 to 60 minutes (This time varies a lot for me â I just let it rise according to how long it is until dinner time)., To make the pizza, While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 500 degrees. If you have a baking stone, put it in the oven to heat, too. I would recommend using a stone for baking this pizza. If you donât have a stone, you can turn your biggest cookie sheet upside down (so that the flat side is up) or use a rimless sheet. If you are using a stone let the stone heat for 30 minutes. If using a baking sheet, let it heat for 10 minutes., When the oven is hot, cut your dough in half. Place half of the dough on a piece of parchment paper that is 18 inches long. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough (on top of the parchment paper) into a 12 to 14 inch circle. The dough should be about a half-inch thick. Top with 1 cup of pizza sauce, 1 1/2 to 2 cups of shredded mozzarella, and toppings of your choice., When the pizza is all ready, slide the pizza, which is on the parchment paper, onto a rimless cookie sheet or one that is upside down. This will help you get the pizza to the oven., Open the oven and slide the pizza which is still on the parchment paper, from the cookie sheet onto the hot baking stone or hot cookie sheet. I just tug on the edge of the parchment paper with my hands and slide it onto the stone. BE CAREFUL! Your oven is set to 500. Itâs super hot, obviously! Make sure the babies are out of the way and be careful when sliding the pizza into the oven., Bake for 10 to 15 minutes until the top is bubbly and the edges are starting to brown. When the pizza is done, tug the edge of the parchment paper and slide the pizza back onto the cookie sheet you used to transfer it to the oven.

Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes. *If you donât have a stand mixer, simply use a large mixing bowl and mix the dough with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in the next step., Add the olive oil, salt, and flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes., Knead the dough:, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If youâre new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your fingerâif it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a âwindowpane testâ to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until itâs thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., Rise, Rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick sprayâjust use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size. (Tip: For the warm environment on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150Â°F (66Â°C). Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When itâs doubled in size, remove from the oven.), Preheat oven to 475Â°F (246Â°C). Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you shape the pizza. (If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.) Lightly grease baking sheet or pizza pan with nonstick spray or olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor., Shape the dough, When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. (If not making 2 pizzas, freeze half of the dough for another time. See freezing instructions below.) On a lightly floured work surface using lightly floured hands or rolling pin, gently flatten the dough into a disc. Place on prepared pan and, using lightly floured hands, stretch and flatten the disc into a 12-inch circle, about 1/2-inch thick. If the dough keeps shrinking back as you try to stretch it, stop what youâre doing, cover it lightly for 5-10 minutes, then try again. Once shaped into a 12-inch circle, lift the edge of the dough up to create a lip around the edges. I simply pinch the edges up to create the rim. If using a pizza stone, place the dough directly on bakerâs peels dusted with cornmeal., Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for a few minutes as you prepare your pizza toppings. I suggest pepperoni & green peppers or jalapeÃ±o slices, extra cheese pizza, Hawaiian pizza, pesto pizza, spinach artichoke white pizza, or homemade BBQ chicken pizza., Top & bake the pizza, Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. To prevent the filling from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the top lightly with olive oil. Top with your favorite toppings and bake for 13-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown., Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size, about 1 hour., When the dough has risen, punch it down and place it on a lightly floured surface. Cut in half and roll each part into a ball. Cover the dough balls with a damp kitchen towel and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes (the dough will rise a bit)., Meanwhile, set an oven rack in the bottom position and preheat the oven to 500Â°F. Sprinkle the cornmeal on an 18x13-inch baking sheet; set aside. Cut the tomatoes crosswise into â-inch-thick slices and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain the juices., Lightly dust a work surface with flour, and then press and stretch the rested dough into two 12x8-inch rectangles. If the dough is sticky, dust it lightly with flour. Place the two pizza doughs side-by-side on the cornmeal-dusted baking sheet. Press the dough out again so that it almost touches the edges of the pan., Spread â cup of the pesto evenly over the pizzas (2Â½ tablespoons each), leaving a 1-inch border. Bake on the bottom rack for 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven; and then top the pizzas with the mozzarella cheese, followed by the tomato slices and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Season each pizza with an â-teaspoon salt and a few grinds fresh black pepper. Place the pizzas back in the oven and bake until the crust is crisp and golden, 6 to 8 minutes more. Transfer the pizzas to a cutting board. Drizzle the remaining pesto over the pizzas and sprinkle with the fresh basil. Cut into slices and serve immediately., Note: Active dry yeast may be used instead of instant/rapid-rise yeast, however, the dough will take longer to rise. To give active dry yeast a boost, you can dissolve it in the warm water and let it sit until frothy, about 10 minutes. After that, add it to the flour, olive oil, and salt, and proceed with the recipe., Make Ahead Instructions: Once the dough has completed it's initial rise, and you've cut it in half to form two balls, lightly coat each dough ball with olive oil. Place the dough ball(s) into a freezer bag and seal shut, squeezing out all the air. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 days.

Stir with a spatula to combine â it doesnât have to be uniformly mixed. Add the flour. Mix again until the flour is completely incorporated. Transfer to a straight-sided vessel (if you have one.) Cover vessel with tea towel or cloth bowl cover and let stand 30 minutes., Stretch and fold, after 30 minutes have passed, reach into the vessel and pull the dough up and into the center. Turn the vessel quarter turns and continue this pulling 8 to 10 times. See video for guidance. Let the dough rest for another 30 minutes; then repeat the stretching and folding. If possible, repeat this cycle twice more for a total of 4 stretch and folds. By the 4th cycle, you will notice a huge difference in the texture of the dough: it will be smoother, stronger, and more elastic., Bulk fermentation, Cover vessel with a tea towel or bowl cover and set aside to rise at room temperature (70ÂºF/21ÂºC) for 4 to 18 hours (the time will vary depending on the time of year, the strength of your starter, and the temperature of your kitchen; see notes above) or until the dough has roughly doubled in volume. (UPDATE: In the past I have recommended letting the dough rise until it doubles in volume. If youâve had success with this, continue to let the dough double. Recently, I have been stopping the bulk fermentation when the dough increases by 50% in volume, and I feel my dough is even stronger in the end.) Note: Do not use your oven with the light on for the bulk fermentation â it is too warm for the dough. When determining when the bulk fermentation is done, it is best to rely on visual cues (doubling in volume) as opposed to time. A straight-sided vessel makes monitoring the bulk fermentation especially easy because it allows you to see when your dough has truly doubled., Portion and shape, Turn the dough out onto a work surface and shape into a rough ball, using as much flour as needed â the dough will be sticky. Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Sprinkle portions with flour. With floured hands, roll each portion into a ball, using the pinkie-edges of your hands to pinch the dough underneath each ball. Transfer each round of dough to a plastic quart container, cover, and store in fridge for at least 6 hours or up to 3 days or transfer to the freezer (see notes in post about thawing)., Make the pizzas, Pull out a round (or more) of dough from the fridge one hour before you plan on baking. Dust dough with flour and place on a floured work surface. Let sit untouched for about an hour (a little longer or shorter is fine). Place a Baking Steel or pizza stone in the top third of your oven. Set oven to 550ÂºF. Heat oven for at least 45 minutes but ideally 1 hour prior to baking., Shape the dough, Gently shape dough into a 10-inch (roughly) round handling it as minimally as possible. (See video for guidance.) Lay a sheet of parchment paper on top of a pizza peel. Transfer the dough round to the parchment-lined peel., Top and Bake, To make a classic Margherita-style pizza, Spread 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce over the surface of the dough. Top with mozzarella to taste. Sprinkle with parmesan to taste. Drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt. Shimmy the pizza, parchment paper and all into the oven. Bake pizza until top is blistered, about 5-6 minutes. Transfer to cutting board. Sprinkle with basil, if you have it. Cut and serve. Discard parchment paper., To make a kale and crÃ¨me fraÃ®che pizza, Place the kale in a small bowl, drizzle with olive oil, season with sea salt, and toss. Spoon crÃ¨me fraÃ®che over the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border or soâI use about a tablespoon per pizza. Sprinkle with minced garlic and a handful of grated Parmigiano Reggiano. Top with the kale. Shimmy the pizza, parchment paper and all into the oven. Bake pizza until top is blistered, about 5 â 6 minutes. Transfer to cutting board. Cut and serve. Discard parchment paper., To make a naked pizza with scallion oil, Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a skillet with 1/4 cup of minced scallions (or ramps!) and 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes. Keep it over low heat while you make the pizza. Spoon crÃ¨me fraÃ®che over the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border or soâI use about a tablespoon per pizza. Sprinkle with a handful of grated parmesan. Shimmy the pizza, parchment paper and all into the oven. Bake pizza until top is blistered, about 5 â 6 minutes. Transfer to cutting board. At this point, the scallions should be starting to âfrizzleâ. If they arenât, crank up the heat until the oil is sizzling.

Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved. After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive. (Note that if you are using ""instant yeast"" instead of ""active yeast"", no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next step.), Make and knead the pizza dough: Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment. Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes. If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand. The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour., Let the dough rise: Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil. At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with. Cover the dough with plastic wrap. For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75Â°F to 85Â°F) for 1 1/2 hours. For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours.

If your mixing bowl is cold, first warm it up a bit by swirling some hot water in it. Discard the hot water and then pour luke warm water. An ideal temperature of warm water is 40 to 43 C or 105 to 110 F., Dip your finger and ensure the water is warm and not hot. Then add yeast and sugar. Stir and set aside undisturbed for 10 to 12 minutes., After 15 mins the yeast mixture should become bubbly or frothy indicating it is active and alive. If it doesnât turn frothy by then, the yeast is inactive and cannot be used for the dough. In this case discard and start afresh with luke warm water, sugar and yeast., When the water turns frothy, add flour, salt and oil. Next mix and make a soft dough adding more water if needed., Knead the dough very well until soft & elastic for about 5 to 6 mins., To check if it is done, poke it with your finger. It should dent easily and bounce back slowly. This is an indication of the dough being ready., Apply a thin layer of oil to the bowl and the dough as well. Keep covered with a moist cloth or a lid., Proofing pizza dough, Let it rise at room temperature until it doubles or triples. An ideal temperature for rising dough is 26C (80 F) to 32C (90 F). Depending on the temperature it will take any where from 1 to 4 hours to rise., High temperatures will kill the yeast so be cautious. Let it rise slowly for longer so it develops a good flavor. During winters, you may proof it in your instant pot on the yogurt settings (LOW)., Prepare pizza sauce, Puree or chop tomatoes finely. To make sauce, heat oil in a pan and saute garlic until it smells good. Then add red chili flakes & mix., Add tomatoes, salt and sugar. Stir and continue to cook covering partially as it splatters a lot., Cook until the sauce thickens and is of spreading consistency (but not runny). Add herbs and crushed pepper., Mix and taste the sauce. You may add more salt, herbs and pepper to suit your taste buds. Set this aside to cool., Prepare veggies, Bring your choice of veggies to room temperature. Avoid using cold veggies from the refrigerator as they let out moisture on the pizza making it soggy., Rinse and slice or cube the veggies. Separate the layers of onions. Avoid chopping them too small or too large., If using bottled olives drain them to a small strainer. Grate or cube the cheese and set aside., How to make pizza (thin crust), When the dough rises well, punch it a few times to deflate and remove air bubbles., Transfer the dough to the work area. Divide to 2 to 3 portions depending on the size you prefer., Knead it a bit and gently shape it to round balls. If the dough is too sticky then sprinkle some flour & knead. After this step you may make the pizza or cover the bowl with a cling wrap and refrigerate it for up to 3 days., When you are ready to make the pizza, preheat the oven to the highest temperature, 220 to 240 C or 470F for at least 25 to 30 mins. Place a baking tray or a cast iron pan in the middle rack and heat it as well in the oven., Sprinkle some cornmeal over the pizza tray. Place the pizza dough over the tray and flatten it slightly., Add few drops of oil on the dough. Begin to spread and stretch the dough on the tray with your fingers. Flatten to a 9 inch thin even base. Keep the edges slightly thicker than the center. (with this recipe you can make three 9 inch thin crust pizzas or one 14 inch thin crust.), Spread the pizza sauce as desired, leaving about Â¼ inch on the edges. Layer the grated cheese and then the veggies. Lastly sprinkle Italian herbs and red chili flakes. To finish off top with more cheese if desired avoiding over the veggies., Place the pizza tray right over the hot baking tray or cast iron pan in your oven. Bake for 10 to 12 mins or until the pizza base becomes crisp, golden and cheese turns slightly golden., If your cheese doesnât turn golden, you can move it to the top rack and bake for another 1 to 2 mins. Slice and serve pizza hot or warm., To make thick crust, To make a thick crust pizza, spread the dough to a slightly thicker base (â inch) with your hands so the sides are thicker than the middle., Prick the base with a fork 8 to 9 times randomly so the base doesn't puff like bread., If making a thick base & you own a small oven, then put the base in the oven without the sauce and toppings.

Attach the dough attachment if using a stand mixer or use a large wooden spoon and pour in the hot water and olive oil. Begin mixing the dough. If using a stand mixer, mix the dough on medium-high speed for 7-9 minutes. Or knead the dough in the bowl. The dough should be slightly shaggy and tacky at this point. Then lightly flour a clean surface and place the dough onto the surface. Lightly knead the dough for 2-3 minutes until it becomes less tacky and more smooth. Place the dough ball into the oiled bowl, cover, and allow the dough to double in size by placing it in a warm area, at least 85F., Make the pizzas, Preheat the oven to 475F. Once the dough has doubled in size, lightly punch down the dough. Re-flour a clean surface or use a piece of parchment paper. This will be where you form the pizza dough. Remove the dough from the bowl and divide the dough in half. If freezing the other half of the dough, see blog post for instructions. For the first pizza, begin to form the dough into a disk shape. Place the pizza dough on a piece of floured parchment paper or lightly floured surface, and gently push the middle of the dough out, being careful not to stretch the dough. See the video for a better visual. Your pizza should measure about 18â³ in diameter. Repeat for the remaining dough ball., Garnish the pizzas:, Spread 1/2- 2/3 cup pizza sauce over the dough, and sprinkle the vegan cheese on top.

Add the water. Using a rubber spatula, mix until the water is absorbed and the ingredients form a sticky dough ball. Slick the dough with a teaspoon of olive oil. Cover the bowl with an airtight lid. Let rise overnight or for 10 to 12 hours at room temperature., Using lightly oiled hands or a flexible bowl scraper, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it towards the center. Shape it into a rough ball. Skip to preparing the pan., Place the water in a large bowl. Add the starter and stir with a spatula to combine. Add the salt and stir again; then add the flour. Mix again until the flour is mostly incorporated. Use your hands if necessary to briefly knead in the last bits of flour. Cover vessel with a tea towel or cloth bowl cover and let stand for 30 minutes., After 30 minutes have passed, reach into the vessel and pull the dough up and into the center. Turn the vessel quarter turns and continue this pulling 8 to 10 times. Let the dough rest for another 30 minutes; then repeat the stretching and folding. After these two sets of stretches and folds, you should see a difference in the texture of the dough: it will be smoother, stronger, and more elastic., If you have a straight-sided vessel, transfer the dough to it; then cover it with a tea towel or bowl cover and set aside to rise at room temperature (70ÂºF/21ÂºC) for 4 to 8 hours (the time will vary depending on the time of year, the strength of your starter, and the temperature of your kitchen) or until the dough has roughly doubled in volume. (A straight-sided vessel makes monitoring the bulk fermentation especially easy because it allows you to see when your dough has truly doubled.), Turn the dough out onto a work surface and shape into a rough ball. I like to do this without flour, but use flour as needed â the dough will be sticky. Use the pinkie-edges of your hands to pinch the dough underneath to create a ball. Skip to preparing the pan., Grease a 10Ã14-inch pan with the tablespoon of softened butter. Pour 1 teaspoon of olive oil into the center. Place the dough ball in the pan and turn to coat. Let rest for 3 to 4 hours. With lightly oiled hands, stretch the dough to fit the pan. Let the dough rest again for 1 hour., Parbake the dough:, Preheat the oven to 500ÂºF., Dimple the dough one last time with lightly oiled hands taking care not to dimple the perimeter. Transfer the pan to the oven for 8 minutes., Remove the pan from the oven and carefully transfer the dough to a cooling rack. Let it cool upside down on the rack for 20 minutes. Do not wash the pan., Once the dough is cooled, you can transfer it to an airtight storage bag for 1 to 2 days at room temperature or up to 3 months in the freezer., Preheat the oven to 475ÂºF. If you do have a Baking Steel or pizza stone, place it on a rack in the middle or lower third of the oven while it preheats., Return the parbaked crust to its pan (bottom side down)., Combine the two pre-shredded cheeses for the frico crust in a medium bowl. Spread this cheese around the perimeter of the dough pressing it into the sides of the pan., Sprinkle the hand-grated mozzarella over the interior surface of the dough., Finish topping the pizza: spread the 1/2 cup of tomato sauce evenly over the top. Spread the pepperoni evenly over the surface. If you are using pickled jalapeÃ±os, scatter them evenly over the pizza, keeping in mind heat tolerance â they make the pizza very spicy., Transfer pizza to the oven for 10 minutes or until the edges are caramelized to your liking. Remove the pan from the oven and let the pizza rest for 5 minutes in the pan. Carefully run a paring knife or spatula around the panâs edges. Then, carefully remove the entire pizza from the pan, transferring it to a cutting board. If you are using the honey, drizzle it over top.

If the dough becomes too sticky, gradually add additional flour in small dustings, up to 1/3 cup additional. If you poke the dough with your finger and it slowly comes back, itâs ready to rise. Shape into a ball., Drizzle a separate large glass bowl with a little olive oil and use a pastry brush to distribute the oil on the bottom and sides. Add the ball of dough. Cover with plastic wrap and allow it to rise for 30-60+ minutes, until doubled in size. (This gives time to for the gluten to develop, which allows the dough to stretch without breaking.) You can also let it rise in the fridge overnight., Preheat oven to 450Â° F during the last 30+ minutes to ensure it has plenty of time to get fully up to temperature. Place the pizza pan (or stone) in the oven as it preheats., Gently punch down the dough and knead it 5 times to smooth it out., Spread the dough into an even 12-inch circle, either with your hands or with a rolling pin.

Transfer the dough onto it., Use a fork to gently poke holes in the dough to prevent the crust from bubbling up as it bakes. Drizzle it with 1 tablespoon olive oil and use a pastry brush to spread it out over the dough., Top with pizza sauce, cheese, and toppings., Bake for 13-15 minutes. Even if the cheese is melted, give the crust enough time to cook and crisp on the bottom, resist the urge to remove it too early, but donât let it get too brown on the top. Mine takes 15 minutes exactly., Remove the pizza from the oven and use a spatula to lift the crust to check the bottom, ensuring itâs slightly browned and crisp., Garnish with parsley, grated Parmesan, and red pepper flakes if desired.

If using a different pan, especially if itâs not non-stick, line the bottom with parchment paper to fit the inside dimensions of the pan (no overhang). Dark pans are best for heat conduction and crust color., I bake my sourdough pizza @ 450 F. I know my oven. However, if you prefer to bake at a lower temperature, approximately 425 F, you can. Increase the bake times to 18-20 minutes, for both the par-bake and actual pizza bake., Please use quality whole-milk mozzarella cheese (block cheese, not bagged shredded). Bagged shredded cheese contains too many anti-caking agents which will wreck your pizza. The cheese will taste dry and plasticky. Cube any small chunks that are too small to grate, and stick in the corners of the pan for extra crispy edges., Use room temperature ingredients. No cold sauce! This will ensure a crisp, pizza crust crust. It will also keep the oven temperature hot and stable, not steamy.","Make the Dough, In the evening, combine the sourdough starter and water in a large mixing bowl (I use a fork to mix).

Use your hands to rub the bottom and sides of the pan., Remove the dough directly into the pan. With oiled fingertips, gently dimple and stretch the dough to reach the corners and sides of the pan- thatâs the end goal. If the dough is relaxed, it will naturally spread out. If itâs tight, which is normal after a long rise, the dough will resist. Simply take note of your dough at this stage. Donât force it. Watch my video for visual instructions., Cover the pan with an inverted baking sheet and rest in a warm spot, such as a proofing box set to 78F or a turned off oven with the light on, for 30 minutes., After 30 minutes has elapsed: return to the pan and dimple the dough again, just like you did before, gently lifting and stretching it as you go. Cover and rest for another 30 minutes. Preheat your oven to 450 F now., After the second 30 minutes has elapsed, youâre ready to par-bake the pizza crust., ParBake Pizza Crust, Place the baking pan on the bottom rack. Bake the dough @ 450 F for 15-18 minutes, or until the surface is set and the bottom crust is light golden brown. Use tongs to peek underneath the dough to double check.

Knead the dough for 5 minutes and shape into a ball., Place the dough into an oiled mixing bowl and turn to coat. Cover and allow to rise for 1 Â½ - 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size., Meanwhile, make the balsamic reduction and caramelized onions. To make the balsamic reduction, add the balsamic vinegar and maple syrup to a small saucepan and cook on medium-low heat until the liquid has reduced to Â¼ its original volume, roughly 15 - 20 minutes. Check and stir regularly to make sure it doesn't burn., When finished, the reduction will be very dark in color, similar to chocolate syrup., To make caramelized onions, place sliced onions in a dry pan over medium-high heat and cover with a lid., Check and stir regularly, until a good amount of color has developed, about 5-7 minutes. Deglaze your pan using the Â¼ cup of water, stir the onions well and be sure to scrape up the brown bits that have collected on the bottom of the pan. Once the water has cooked off, add 1 tbsp olive oil and salt and continue to cook the onions about another 5 minutes. When finished, the onions should have a nice deep dark brown color and a sweet smell., Once the dough has doubled in size, you are ready to assemble and bake the pizza.

Sprinkle some flour on your table and turn the dough onto the table. Knead the dough by hand until it is smooth and elastic, adding flour as needed. This should take 6 to 10 minutes of kneading. Place the dough back in the bowl, cover it with a towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 15 to 60 minutes (this time varies a lot for me â I just let it rise according to how long it is until dinner time)., While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 500 degrees F. If you have a baking stone, put it in the oven to heat up, too. I would recommend using a stone for baking this pizza. If you donât have a stone, you can turn your biggest cookie sheet upside down (so that the flat side is up), or use a rimless sheet. If you are using a stone let the stone heat for 30 minutes. If using a baking sheet, let it heat for 15 minutes., When the oven is hot, cut your dough in half. Place half of the dough on a piece of parchment paper that is 18 inches long. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough (on top of the parchment paper) into a large circle. The dough should be between 1/4- and 1/2-inch thick (I like mine thin, Husband likes his thickerâ¦ youâll have to find what you like). Top with 1 cup of pizza sauce, 1 1/2 cups of shredded mozzarella, and half of the crumbled bacon, tomatoes, and herbs., When the pizza is all ready, slide the pizza, which is on the parchment paper, onto a rimless cookie sheet or one that is upside down.

Make sure the babies are out of the way, and be careful when sliding the pizza into the oven., Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until the top is bubbly and the edges are starting to brown.

Or use a heavy-duty stand mixer fitted with the dough attachment. Then add all of the flour and mix with a wooden spoon, dough whisk, or the mixer. Cover with a lid (not airtight). Allow the dough to rise at room temperature, approximately 2 hours., Shape the dough balls, After rising, divide the dough into 8 equal balls. For each ball, pull up and cut off a half-pound (orange-sized) piece of dough, using a serrated knife or kitchen shears. Hold the piece of dough in your hands and add a little more flour as needed so it wonât stick to your hands. Gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides, rotating the dough a quarter-turn as you go to form a ball. Most of the dusting flour will fall off., Refrigerate the dough balls, each wrapped well in plastic wrap, and use over the next week, or freeze for up to 2 months., On Pizza Day, Prepare and measure your toppings in advance: This will help you top the pizza quickly so you can get it into the oven before it sticks to the pizza peel., Position a baking stone in the bottom third of the oven and preheat the oven to its highest temperature., Prepare a pizza peel with flour, cornmeal, or parchment paper to prevent sticking when you slide the pizza into the oven. Sprinkle the surface of one of the refrigerated dough balls with flour., Roll out and stretch a pizza crust: Flatten the dough with your hands and a rolling pin on the counter or directly onto the pizza peel to produce a 1/8-inch-thick round, dusting with flour to keep the dough from adhering to your work surface. Use a dough scraper to âun-stickâ the dough as needed, and transfer it to the prepared pizza peel if you havenât stretched the dough directly on one. When youâre finished, the dough round will be about 12 inches across, and should have enough flour under it to move easily when you shake the peel. As you add the toppings, continue to test for sticking by gently shaking the peel. The pizza should move freely. If it doesnât, use the dough scraper and some flour to un-stick it., Add the toppings: Spread 1/4 cup of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border at the edges, then add 3 ounces of mozzarella and several basil leaves, and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. We prefer using well-spaced chunks of cheese, which gradually melt and spread (giving the crust a longer opportunity to crisp before toppings burn). Drizzle a little olive oil over the pizza., Slide the pizza onto the preheated stone: Place the tip of the peel near the back of the stone, close to where you want the far edge of the pizza to land. Give the peel a few quick forward-and-back jiggles and pull it sharply out from under the pizza. Check for doneness in 8 to 10 minutes and turn the pizza around in the oven if one side is browning too fast. It may take up to 5 more minutes in the oven. Allow to cool slightly, preferably on a wire rack, so that the cheese sets., Repeat with the remaining 7 dough balls and toppings., Rate and Review!, If you've made this recipe, please leave a rating and review!

Mix together until the poolish loosens and mixes into the water., Next, add half of the flour and mix well (I like to use a Danish whisk)., Add the salt., Then add the remaining flour., Mix just for a few seconds, then turn out onto a board or counter to mix by hand. After it all comes together (it will be very sticky) turn the bowl upside down over it and let it rest for 15 minutes., After 15 minutes, put some oil on your hands and take the dough up with both hands underneath and allow the two ends to fall, creating an air pocket inside. Continue to pick up the dough and repeat this process, turning a quarter turn each time (Vito's video below will help with this step)., Oil the original bowl and place the dough in the bowl, always keeping the top side up. Allow to rise for an hour., Next, cut into 5 equal sized pieces., Fold and roll the pieces into balls, being sure to keep the top facing upwards when you are finished., Place them on a tray sprinkled with fine semolina flour, or flour so that it doesn't stick., Top each ball with a little olive oil, cover with plastic wrap., Alternatively, place in the oven (without turning it on) and place a jug of boiling water inside with the tray. Allow to rise for two more hours., If using a pizza stone, put it in the oven and turn on the oven to 500F (260C) or as hot as it can be set, an hour before the pizza is ready. This will ensure the pizza stone is super hot. If using a countertop pizza oven, there's no need to heat it up this early., After two hours, take one ball of homemade pizza dough and put in on some semolina flour, top and bottom, always keep it right side up when you finish. Start pushing the dough in the center towards the edges., If you have an indoor countertop pizza oven, you want to have the dough on the peel at this point.

Bread flour is a good 2nd choice. All-purpose flour works fine, too, if that's what you have on hand. Monica's favorite is a 50-50 mix of ""00"" and all-purpose flour., TO MIX DOUGH: Add flour, yeast, and salt to a 3 quart (or larger) bowl and whisk to combine. Stir in water and oil and combine until uniformly moist with no dry flour remaining. The dough should be fairly wet and sticky (but not soupy); if it's dry, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time., Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Leave on counter at room temperature for 4 to 12 hours (8 or more hours is best, if you have time). Dough will bubble and expand. It's fine if it begins to collapse. No need to stir or punch it down--just leave it alone., Move covered bowl to refrigerator for a minimum of 3 hours and up to 5 days before using dough. If possible, refrigerating it at least overnight will improve the flavor and texture, 2 or 3 days is even better. It can be refrigerated as long as 5 days. Also may be divided into smaller portions, wrapped, and frozen at this point for up to 1 month., 1 batch of dough is enough for 8 individual pizzas, 4 medium pizzas, or 2 large pizzas., TO USE DOUGH: Remove from refrigerator 1-2 hours before use. Use a knife or your fingers to cut & pull off the amount of dough you want to use. With floured hands, stretch the dough and tuck the edges under to form a ball; place on floured surface, lightly dust tops with flour, cover with plastic wrap or dish towel, and allow to rest for 1-2 hours., PRE-HEAT BAKING STONE. If using a baking stone, place it on the lower rack of a cool oven. Preheat oven to 525 degrees F for at least 45 minutes. (If your oven doesn't heat that high, set it as high as you can.) If using a metal sheet pan, it doesn't need to be preheated., After resting dough for 1-2 hours, lay dough ball on flat, floured surface; press and stretch it until it is desired size, approx. 1/4 to 1/8 "" thick. If dough is too elastic (it springs back when you try to roll or stretch it), cover it and let it rest for another 10-15 minutes before trying to stretch and shape it again. Don't worry about dough being a perfect circle; an uneven shape is easier and has an appealing rustic appearance., FOR BAKING STONE: Form dough on top of a piece of parchment paper cut to fit on stone (pizza may be baked on top of the paper), add toppings, and use a a pizza peel to transfer to oven. Bake in preheated 525 degree oven for 8-10 minutes., FOR METAL SHEET PAN: Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Do not form dough on parchment paper.

9d7aa391,https://www.theboywhobakes.co.uk/recipes/2020/5/15/sourdough-neapolitan-ish-pizza,Sourdough Neapolitan (ish) Pizza,"500g 00 Pizza Flour, 15g fine sea salt, 325ml water, 75g mature sourdough starter, 10ml extra virgin olive oil","To make the dough pour the water into a large bowl and scrape in the mature starter/levain and mix with your fingers briefly to break up a little. Add in the flour, salt and olive oil and use your fingers to mix this to form a shaggy dough. We are not kneading at this point, we just want everything to be hydrated with no pockets of flour. Once mixed scrape off any dough from your fingers and cover the bowl and set aside in a warm spot for 30 minutes to rest., Once rested we are going to knead the dough. You can do this by hand for about 10 minutes, in mixer for 5-8 minutes or use the slap and fold method. If you havenât heard of this technique before its a great method for kneading sticky doughs when you donât have a mixer. I learnt it originally from Richard Bertinet (who has excellent bread books should you want more reading) which makes sense as this is often known as the French method. Basically you scrape the dough out onto the worsurface. Both hands go under the ought, scooping it up turning it over and slapping it dough on the counter (this basically tuns it over) the dough is then stretched back towards you a little and then folded over on itself. This motion is repeated over and over again for about 8 minutes or until the dough looks smoother and is nice and elastic., Once the dough is kneaded use a dough scraper to form the dough into a ball and place seam side up into a bowl very lightly greased with olive oil. Cover the bowl and set aside somewhere warm (26-27C is perfect) for the moment. After 30 minutes, using the techniques we learnt making our first loaf of sourdough bread, were going to preform a set of stretch and folds to build in more strength. Cover the bowl and leave for another 30 minutes before doing a second, and final, set of stretch and folds. Cover the bowl and place back in its warm spot and leave for another three hours, a total of 4 hours., After 4 hours you should be able to see some signs of fermentation, even if the dough hasnât risen significantly. The dough should have a slight domed appearance and there should be lots of fermentation bubbles over the surface. Carefully turn the dough out onto the worksurface and use a dough scraper to divide into 4 pieces (you can weigh these if youâre looking for perfectly portioned pieces). Form the dough into balls, trying to make the shaping nice and tight so the skin on the outside of the dough is taught., Once divided and balled you need to decide if youâre going to use all four of the pizza balls tomorrow or if you want to freeze them to use at a later date. If using tomorrow simple place them into a lightly floured container, a high walled plastic box is good for this or a baking tray with high sides, something that means when covered the lid or clingfilm wont touch the dough. If freezing the balls I like to place these into small individual plastic tubs greased with little oil. Either way once in their new resting place the dough needs to sit for a further four hours, again in a warm spot around 26-27C is ideal. Once out second four hour stint is up you should once again be able to see signs of fermentation. If in the individual containers you should be able to see some rise and bubbling on the sides and if on the floured tray you should see the dough has spread out a little and there is fermentation bubbles on the surface as before. For the dough you want to use later place the containers in the freezer (for up to two weeks) and for the dough you want to use place the container in the fridge for 12-24 hours. You can leave the chilled dough for longer but after 24 hours it can be harder to handle., Once your dough has rested for its desired time it needs to come back to room temperature before using, otherwise itâll be harder to stretch and the chill will affect how it cooks. If using refrigerated dough this means taking out the dough 4-5 hours before you want to use it. If your kitchen is in the low to mid 20âs then room temperature is fine if its colder youâll want to leave it in a warmer spot. If the dough your using is frozen you need to think a bit further ahead. I take the dough out the day before I want to use it leaving it in there for 12-24 hours to slowly defrost and then as with the regular refrigerated dough take it out 4-5 hours before using., When ready to make pizzas get everything set up, get your toppings prepped and your workstation ready. Preheat your frying pan over medium heat for about ?? minutes (this should get it about 300C), it wants to be about as hot as you can get it. Turn on your grill and set a rack just below, giving you enough space to fit the frying pan., Carefully remove a portion of dough from its container (dough scraper is good for this if you chilled the dough on a tray) and place onto a floured surface, dusting the top of the dough too. Press your fingers into the middle of the dough, leaving the outside inch or so untouched. To stretch the dough I place it on the back of my fists, resting it on my knuckles and gently stretch it as I turn the dough. You donât want to use a rolling pin as youâll deflate the dough and youâll have wasted all that time. Once stretched to about 9-10 inches carefully transfer it to the pan. The base will start to cook immediately so as soon as the base is in top it with your tomato sauce (recipe below) spreading to the edges but leaving the now puffed up crust clear. I donât add the cheese yet because I find it releases too much water if cooked for too long. Use a spatula to keep an eye on the base and as soon as it has nicely browned spots on the base, working quickly, add your toppings. This entire cooking process should take 2 minutes, 3 max. Carefully lift the frying pan under the grill and cook until the cheese has melted and the crust is browned. With this method you wont get the leopard spotting you associate with Neapolitan pizza but it will brown and I personally like to take it pretty far so there are nice dark spots around the pizza. Remove the pan from the grill and immediately transfer the pizza to a plate. Finish with a drizzle of oil and some fresh basil (you can add the basil before hand but because the pizza cooks for longer than in a restaurant oven I prefer adding it after cooking).","[('pizza flour', 500.0, 'g'), ('fine sea salt', 15.0, 'g'), ('water', 325.0, 'ml'), ('mature sourdough starter', 75.0, 'g'), ('extra virgin olive oil', 10.0, 'ml')]"

Simply mix the water, olive oil and buttermilk together; mix the yeast, sugar, flour and salt together; then combine wet and dry ingredients until mixed.), Whisk in olive oil and buttermilk (or yogurt). Sprinkle flour and salt over top. Mix until combined. Dough will be really wet and sticky. Cover bowl with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap and place in a warm spot. (Note: To create a warm spot, turn your oven on for 1 minute, then shut it off â it will be barely warm. You should be able to touch your hands to the grates without them burning you, but be careful while you test them out.), Let rise until doubled, 1 to 2 hours. Forty-five minutes before baking, place Steel in oven and preheat oven to 550ÂºF. Note: If your dough is in the oven rising, be sure to remove it. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and turn dough to coat. Divide dough into 4 equal sections. Dough will be sticky, so just try to handle it minimally using as much flour as needed to keep it from sticking to your hands and your work surface. Shape each section into a ball and let rest for at least 20 minutes before shaping but up to an hour if necessary., To shape the dough, you can use two approaches, and if you are up for experimenting, it's interesting to see how the different approaches produce different results., Use a rolling pin to roll dough into an oval about 8 inches long, then transfer dough to a parchment paper-lined peel.

Transfer dough to a parchment paper-lined peel. Again, you can fit two of these ovals at a time on the Steel. Wet your fingers and lightly rub surface of dough with water. My thoughts: I prefer not using a rolling pin. When I stretch the dough gently, I find I get nicer air pockets in the finished dough and that the naan itself remains more pliable after it has baked. When I use the rolling pin, the finished naan is stiffer, more like flatbread â still tasty, but not my preference as far as texture goes. The key I have found when using your hands versus is a rolling pin is to be sure to stretch the naan out as well as possible â if you don't get good length, parts of the naan will be really thick and doughy â again, delicious, but not the ideal texture for naan., Shimmy naan onto Baking Steel.

Mix well with your hands to help dissolve the salt. Add 100g (10% flour) to the water and mix it through with your hands until the flour dissolves. This will result in a crepe/pancake consistency. Next, add the yeast to the salt, water, and flour mixture helping it melt in the water using your fingers. Mix with your hands until completely combined., Important: start adding the flour a little at a time. Add flour with one hand and mix to combine with your other hand as you go. Scrape the sides of the bowl to make sure no flour is wasted., Once the dough has started to come together really well, flip it out on to a bench and start to knead it with both hands absorbing all the remaining flour. Keep working the dough until you find it has come together and has a smooth consistency. Knead the dough by stretching it and fold it over itself to strengthen the gluten strands, and to add air into the dough. But be careful not to stretch the dough so much that it tears. This will develop the gluten in the dough, and make it elastic and stretchy. The kneading process will take around 15-20 minutes. To check if your dough is ready to rest: press down on the dough ball with one finger and if it bounces back, chances are, itâs ready!, Once ready, place the dough aside to rest on a flat surface, covering it with a damp cloth so it doesnât dry out. Leave this to rest for at least 2hr., Once 2hr have passed, itâs time to make your dough balls. To do this, cut a piece of your dough and weigh it on a scale aiming for 250g/8.8oz. You should have about 8 dough balls. To make the dough ball, the easiest way, ""pinch and tuck method"": place small dough chunk on floured surface push down on four corners of the dough with thumb and index fingers., Pinch thumb and index finger together grabbing the dough. Lift the dough up off the floured surface and tuck and pinch the corners together on the underside of the dough. As you do this, the dough on the upward facing portion should stretch creating a smooth surface. Place the pinched side facing down on the floured surface and rotate the dough a quarter turn. Repeat 4-5 times until a nice ball has formed, Once you have made the dough balls, place them in a flat surface covered in plastic wrap, or air tight container. Leave at room temperature for 24hr. IT IS WORTH THE WAIT!, After 24hrs your dough balls should have risen and are ready to use. Sprinkle flour on to the bench, placing the dough on top and starting an inch from the bottom and working your way an inch from the top, press down using your fingers. Then stop, turn it over and repeat until you have a small round base with a âcornicioneâ (crust)., Gently stretch this by then picking up the dough and slightly stretching it onto one forearm then flipping it onto the bench. Repeat this before shaping it into a circle and then resting it on your bench., Heat Oven to hottest setting 550 degrees F with pizza stone in the middle rack, or heat your professional pizza oven to 750-900 degree F. If using your regular oven, let it heat for 30 minutes with the stone to get the stone really hot., Add tomato puree as desired onto the flattened dough and put pizza in the middle rack of the oven on a pizza stone, baking at 550 degrees F. about 10-15 minutes. If using a real high heat pizza oven of 900 degrees F the cooking time is 5 minutes. Add the fresh mozzarella half way into the baking time in the regular oven. Other ingredients such as extra virgin olive oil and basil should be added at the end of cooking about 1 minute before taking out of the oven, or simply add after baking.

This should take 30 to 45 seconds in a mixer using the beater paddle; or about 1 minute by hand, using a spoon or spatula.Â Scrape down the sides of the bowl to gather the dough into a rough ball; cover the bowl.,   ,         , , After 5 minutes, uncover the bowl and reach a bowl scraper or your wet hand down between the side of the bowl and the dough, as though you were going to lift the dough out. Instead of lifting, stretch the bottom of the dough up and over its top. Repeat three more times, turning the bowl 90Â° each time. This process of four stretches, which takes the place of kneading, is called a fold.Â ,   ,         , , Re-cover the bowl, and after 5 minutes do another fold. Wait 5 minutes and repeat; then another 5 minutes, and do a fourth and final fold. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest, undisturbed, for 40 minutes. Then refrigerate it for a minimum of 12 hours, or up to 72 hours. It'll rise slowly as it chills, developing flavor; this long rise will also add flexibility to your schedule., , About 3 hours before you want to serve your pizza, prepare your pan. Pour 1 1/2 tablespoons (18g) olive oil into aÂ well-seasonedÂ cast iron skillet thatâs 10â to 11â diameter across the top, and about 9â across the bottom. Heavy, dark cast iron will give you a superb crust; but if you donât have it, use another oven-safe heavy-bottomed skillet of similar size, or a 10â round cake pan or 9â square pan.Â Tilt the pan to spread the oil across the bottom, and use your fingers or a paper towel to spread some oil up the edges, as well.Â Â , , Transfer the dough to the pan and turn it once to coat both sides with the oil.Â After coating the dough in oil, press the dough to the edges of the pan, dimpling it using the tips of your fingers in the process. The dough may start to resist and shrink back; thatâs OK, just cover it and let it rest for about 15 minutes, then repeat the dimpling/pressing. At this point the dough should reach the edges of the pan; if it doesnât, give it one more 15-minute rest before dimpling/pressing a third and final time.Â ,   ,         , , Cover the crust and let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature. The fully risen dough will look soft and pillowy and will jiggle when you gently shake the pan., , About 30 minutes before baking, place one rack at the bottom of the oven and one toward the top (about 4"" to 5"" from the top heating element). Preheat the oven to 450Â°F., , When youâre ready to bake the pizza, sprinkle about three-quarters of the mozzarella (a scant 1 cup) evenly over the crust. Cover the entire crust, no bare dough showing; this willÂ yield caramelized edges. Dollop small spoonfuls of the sauce over the cheese; laying theÂ cheese down first like this will prevent the sauce from seeping into the crust and making it soggy. Sprinkle on the remaining mozzarella.,   ,         , , Bake the pizza on the bottom rack of the oven for 18 to 20 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and the bottom and edges of the crust are a rich golden brown (use a spatula to check the bottom). If the bottom is brown but the top still seems pale, transfer the pizza to the top rack and bake for 2 to 4 minutes longer. On the other hand, if the top seems fine but the bottom's not browned to your liking, leave the pizza on the bottom rack for another 2 to 4 minutes. Home ovens can vary a lot, so use the visual cues and your own preferences to gauge when youâve achieved the perfect bake., , Remove the pizza from the oven and place the pan on a heatproof surface. Carefully run a table knife or spatula between the edge of the pizza and side of the pan to prevent the cheese from sticking as it cools. Let the pizza cool very briefly; as soon as you feel comfortable doing so, carefully transfer it from the pan to a cooling rack or cutting surface. This will prevent the crust from becoming soggy.,   ,         , , Serve the pizza anywhere from medium-hot to warm.

You most definitely need a pizza peel for this â or at least something to easily transfer your dough to your stone., In a large bowl, mix together the water, yeast and honey. Let that sit and get foamy, about 10ish minutes. During that time, I like to get out all of my pizza ingredients and measure them out â because this dough doesnât have to rise! For the above pizza, I used pureed crushed tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, a little crushed garlic and fresh basil leaves. You want everything measured out and ready to top so you can quickly transfer the dough to the stone., After 10 minutes, stir the flour and salt into the yeast mixture. Stir until the dough comes together, first using a spoon and then using your hands.

Flour your pizza peel VERY well. To transfer the thin dough to your peel, I gently and quickly fold the dough in half and then in half again, pick it up, and unfold it on the floured peel. Quickly add your toppings â your sauce and cheese and what not. Remember, with this thin crust it is best to not do tons of heavy toppings. Work quickly so the dough do not stick to the peel., Open the oven and gently slice the pizza from the peel to the stone â I use a spatula to help if needed. Bake the pizza for 10 to 15 minutes â just keep and eye on it since the oven is so hot and stones can differ. It will be done when the crust is crispy and cheese is golden., Remove the pizza by sliding it back onto the pizza peel with the help of a spatula.

But for the cheese to get golden, you can keep the pan near the top rack. If you keep the pan near the bottom rack, the base would get too browned by the time the cheese become golden., Remove the pizza on wooden board and then with a pizza cutter or a knife cut the pizza., Serve thin crust pizza hot.

This will be the mold to shape the sushi block., Pack, Add the rice to the container. Compress it down and flatten it tightly using a rice paddle or the back of a spoon to help the rice grains stick together. Press it down tight and shape it as flat and even as possible. Focus particularly around the corners and the edge as these are the areas that the rice tends to fall apart. The height of the rice block should roughly be around 3/4 -inch (2 cm) thick., Pack, You can also use the container liner to help you shape the edge of the rice by gently lifting it upwards then bringing it inwards to compress the rice grains and help them stick to each other., Chill, Once the rice grains are compressed into a big block and once itâs cool to room temperature.

You can see it will be a wet, saggy dough., With a spatula scrape the dough off the sides of the container to join the dough. Put the lid on the container tightly or cover your bowl with plastic wrap ensuring that no air gets into your dough as it rests. Air can cause the dough to form a skin which is not good for a dough., Allow the dough to sit at room temperature and ferment for about 12-18 hours at cool room temperature. Or you can proof it for about one hour to get it moving and refrigerate it until you wish to use it., After18 hours in a cool place, if you are not planning on baking off the dough you can refrigerate it. The dough can be kept in the fridge for up to 5 days at this stage and baked off any time. While in the fridge the flavor will deepen over that time, developing sourdough characteristics., The next day the dough will have more than doubled in size with lots of the bubbles on top. Also it will smell boozy and fermented. This is exactly what you want., Dust your hands and the surface of the dough with a little flour, just enough to prevent it from sticking to your hands. Gently turn out the dough onto a floured surface. Donât knock out the air from the dough., Cut the dough into 4 pieces and using extra flour to handle if needed. If you are using it from the fridge this action will wake up the dough for you., Lightly knead each portion of dough just to form a ball. Allow the dough to rest on a floured board covered for 30 minutes. Your pizza dough is ready to use!, On a flat baking tray or pizza peel, dust it with flour or semolina. With floured hands gently stretch your pizza dough to 10 inches. You can also use a rolling pin to stretch it out. If you find the dough is springing back and is hard to stretch then let it rest for 10 minutes on the board., Once you have gotten your desired thickness spread on your sauce and add your topping., Important note: Less is more. You donât want to add too many heavy topping on your pizza otherwise you wonât be able to slide it off the baking tray onto the cast iron tray., Bake at 450oF (225oC) for roughly 10 minutes or until the base is crisp and golden brown, Any dough that does not get used can be refrigerated or even frozen, NOTE: As with all dough recipes, the amount of flour will vary depending on weather, brand of flour, etc. Use as much flour as you need to handle the dough, but keep in mind that the stickier the dough, the better the texture of your pizza crust will be.","[('flour', 18.0, 'oz'), ('yeast', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('water', 10.5, 'floz'), ('olive oil', 2.0, 'tablespoons')]"

(See notes above if you need to skip the overnight rise for time purposes.) NOTE: It is important the dough really be slicked with olive oil especially if you are using a cloth bowl cover or tea towel as opposed to plastic wrap or a hard lid. If you are using a tea towel, consider securing it with a rubber band to make a more airtight cover. If you do not slick the dough with enough oil, you risk the dough drying out and forming a crust over the top layer., Line two 8- or 9-inch pie plates or a 9Ã13-inch pan (see notes above) with parchment paper or grease with butter or coat with nonstick cooking spray. (Note: This greasing step may seem excessive, but with some pans, it is imperative to do so to prevent sticking. With my USA pans, I can get away with olive oil alone; with my glass baking dishes, butter is a must.), Pour a tablespoon of oil into the center of each pan or 2 tablespoons of oil if using the 9Ã13-inch pan. Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center. Rotate the bowl in quarter turns as you deflate, turning the mass into a rough ball. Use the forks to split the dough into two equal pieces (or do not split if using the 9Ã13-inch pan). Place one piece into one of the prepared pans. Roll the dough ball in the oil to coat it all over, forming a rough ball. Repeat with the remaining piece.

You can either use it immediately, or keep it, wrapped in plastic wrap, in the fridge (or freezer) until required. If using straightaway, divide the dough up into as many little balls as you want to make pizzas - this amount of dough is enough to make about six to eight medium pizzas., Timing-wise, it's a good idea to roll the pizzas out about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to cook them.

However, if you want to get them rolled out so there's 1 less thing to do when your guests are round, simply roll the dough out into rough circles, about Â¼-inch thick, and place them on slightly larger pieces of olive-oil-rubbed and flour-dusted aluminum foil.

The thicker the yogurt, the thicker the cheese. You can also use soy or coconut.), 1/2 cup (75g) raw, unsalted cashews, 1/2 packed cup (120g) of cooked, peeled and mashed gold potato (You are weighing the 120 grams AFTER you've cooked/peeled & mashed the potato), 1/4 packed cup (50g) cooked white rice, 1/2-1 tablespoon (15g) distilled white vinegar-use 1/2 for mild tang and 1 for extra tang (this is key to the cheesy flavor, so don't sub), 1 teaspoon (5g) fresh lemon juice, 3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt (This is KEY to the cheesy flavor, so don't omit or reduce so it stands out on pizza and in grilled cheese, etc.), Please weigh your ingredients if possible, so you get the exactly right ratios for this cheese to turn out perfectly! You don't need to use the cups to compare measurements, just simply use my gram weights listed. I literally just put my Vitamix on my scale, hit zero, and add each ingredient, hitting zero in between each addition. SO easy and fast., I use this scale.","First, if you don't have a high-powered blender, you will need to soak the cashews overnight in a bowl of warm water so they can be really soft. Otherwise, you will end up with a gritty cheese. No need to soak if you have a Vitamix., Cook the rice and potato. I just popped a couple of potatoes in the microwave wrapped in a wet paper towel and cooked until really soft. Let cool and then peel the skin off and weigh 120 grams (a packed 1/2 cup) and add to a blender or a food processor if you don't have a high-powered blender. For the rice, you can use those frozen white rice packets that cook in 3 minutes or use some already cooked white rice. Just make sure it is not cold stiff rice from the fridge, or it will be hard to blend it up smoothly. Just briefly warm it in the microwave and make sure it is a thick/sticky rice., Add the broth first to the blender, this will make for easier blending. Add the yogurt, cashews, potato, rice, vinegar, lemon juice and salt. Blend on high until 100% smooth, thick and creamy, as pictured. You may need to scrape down the sides a couple of times to get it going. Taste that amazingness! Rich, creamy, tangy and a bite of salty. The salt is important so that it stands out in grilled cheese sandwiches and on pizza, since technically you aren't eating it on its own. While it tastes amazing straight out of the blender, wait to fully judge it on pizza and grilled cheese! It should be thick, gooey and creamy. You can use it right away or place in the fridge to firm up a bit and use it in any of the options below., TO USE FOR GRILLED CHEESE OR QUESADILLAS: This method is different and requires time prep in advance, so please read through. Since grilled cheese is only briefly heated on the stove, the cheese sauce is a bit too runny to use right away for grilled cheese. So, to create a firmer cheese, you will line a 6 inch round cake pan with parchment paper (as pictured) pressing it along the sides of the pan to fit flat. Pour the blended up cheese sauce in the pan and bake at 350Â°F for 10 minutes. This firms up the cheese just a bit, making it less saucy. This allows the cheese to get more thick/firm and less saucy and not ooze out all over the place when you make the grilled cheese or quesadillas. You can use it right away or put in the fridge to firm up even more before using. When ready to make, spread a generous thick layer (several spoonfuls) onto the bread and heat over the stove until browned on both sides. I use a nonstick pan. Spread a thick layer on the bottom of a large tortilla, add toppings and another thin layer on the top tortilla. The cheese will help them to stick., TO USE FOR PIZZA: The cheese is the perfect consistency to use on pizza right after blending, as it's very easy to spread and drizzle or dollop. I always use my Homemade No Yeast Pizza Crust (which is pictured in the post). Simply add the pizza sauce to your pizza crust and all the toppings you want. Then drizzle/spoon the cheese sauce all over the pizza. You want to be generous with adding on top of the pizza, so you really taste the cheese in every bite. Bake at 400Â°F until the cheese is starting to look firm and a bit brown on top. The bake time can vary depending on which crust you use, but I always cook my pizza at 400Â°F for 15-20 minutes or so until the cheese and crust are golden. It browns beautifully., TO USE AS A DIP: You can use it right away from the blender, as it should be warm from blending it up. You can always blend it longer to warm it up, or just heat it over the stove for 3-5 minutes on medium-low just to warm through or thicken it slightly more if desired. Although, it should already be quite thick and creamy as is and it will firm up in the fridge overnight.","[('veggie broth', 120.0, 'g'), ('high fat yogurt', 60.0, 'g'), ('cashews', 75.0, 'g'), ('gold potato', 120.0, 'g'), ('white rice', 50.0, 'g'), ('distilled white vinegar', 15.0, 'g'), ('fresh lemon juice', 5.0, 'g'), ('fine sea salt', 0.75, 'tsp')]"

Continue to stretch the dough into a disk shape. Stretch the dough until it is about the size of a medium (about 11-inches) pizza.

Adjust with a little more flour or water as necessary., Scrape dough into a large container and allow to rise for 15 to 60 minutes. (If you don't want to wait, you certainly don't have to!) We use this time to prep and chop all our toppings, so they're ready to go as soon as the dough is rolled out., Sprinkle a liberal amount of flour on a clean counter top and on your hands. Tear off a chunk of dough about the size of a softball. If you're already an advanced pizza maker, and can toss the dough, by all means go for it. Instead, here's what I do: Form it into a ball and then place on the floured surface. Using a rolling pin (or wine bottle, in a pinch), roll the dough into a 12"" round(ish) shape. It doesn't have to be a perfect circle, but it is a little easier to get in and out of the oven if it's somewhat round., Sprinkle more flour on a pizza peel, and spread it around to be sure it's an even layer. Transfer the rolled dough to the peel. Spoon tomato (or other) sauce onto the dough, then add whatever cheese and toppings you wish., Gently shake the peel forward and back to be sure the pizza slides easily. If not, use a spatula to un-stick it and sprinkle some extra flour underneath. This is important -- you don't want your pizza to end up as a blob of dough and toppings at the bottom of your oven as you try to slide it onto the pizza stone., Gently transfer the pizza to the hot pizza stone, coaxing the back edge of the pizza off the peel and onto the back section of the stone. Carefully pull the pizza peel back towards you, jiggling as necessary, to place the entire pizza on the stone., Bake for 12 minutes, then carefully check for doneness. The center should not be soggy, and the bottom should be crispy all the way across. If not done, bake a few minutes longer and check again., Use the peel to carefully lift the pizza off the stone. Allow to cool for a couple of minutes, then transfer to a cutting board.

(While the food processor makes quick work of the cauliflower and creates a more even size, the kitchen grater is much easier to clean and adds a little more texture. Either way will do so itâs up to your preference.), Grate enough of the cauliflower to produce 3 packed cups of cauliflower rice., Lay out the ""rice"" evenly on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. TIP: Using aluminum foil will cause the cauliflower rice to stick and will be very difficult to remove., We need to first roast the cauliflower to soften it before creating our crust so place this into the oven and roast for 20-25 minutes, tossing every so often., Once the rice is tender and beginning to turn golden brown, remove the rice from the oven and transfer into a clean, thin dishtowel or cheesecloth., Wrap up the rice and twist the towel to squeeze any excess moisture out. Be careful not to burn your hands. (Believe it or not, this step makes a big difference in the final texture of your crust and is totally worth the small extra effort.), Place the drained rice into a mixing bowl, along with the egg, dried oregano, 1/4 tsp,. kosher salt, garlic powder, grated parmesan cheese, and crumbled goat cheese. Mix this together until fully combined., On a clean, new sheet of parchment paper, pour the rice mixture out and form into a small rectangle. Do not use aluminum foil for this step, as the crust will stick., Keep the dough about 1/3 of an inch thick and try to mold it to be as even and as flat as possible. You can also form the edges to stand up to mimic a crust., Once the crust is fully formed, place back into the oven and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the crust is firm and golden brown., At this point, you can top with whatever normal pizza toppings you prefer., For the pizza pictured, I drizzled olive oil over the cooked crust, followed by diced chicken breast, followed by a handful of baby spinach and about 2-3 ounces of sliced mozzarella cheese., Once you have your toppings, place back into the oven and bake until the cheese is melted and the spinach is wilted, about 6-8 minutes., Remove from the oven and allow to sit for 5 minutes before slicing into quarters using a pizza cutter.","[('cauliflower', 3, 'cups'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('oregano', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('salt', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('garlic powder', 0.125, 'tsp'), ('parmesan', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('goat cheese', 3.0, 'oz'), ('chicken breast', 1.0, None), ('salt', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('pepper', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('garlic powder', 0.125, 'tsp'), ('spinach', 1.0, 'handful'), ('mozzarella', 3.0, 'oz')]"

Preheat your oven to 375 degrees., Cook your sausage up with the diced onion, make sure you are breaking up the sausage into a nice crumble as it cooks.

They do not have to be perfect size., Separate the biscuits and put them in a large bowl (pictures in post), Add as much marinara as you like to the cubes in the large bowl. I think about 16 ounces is perfect for us. It makes this saucy but not too saucy. You can test it the first time and adjust as needed next time. It is better to err on the side of less saucy because you want the dough to bake up and you can always add warm sauce to the plates when serving if it is dry., Carefully toss the cubes biscuit dough in the sauce. Try not to smash the dough down so toss lightly, You want the sauce coating the cubes but try to keep the cubes intact., Take the fresh mozzarella and cut into small cubes and add to the biscuits and marinara. Toss carefully again and then add all of this to the 9 x 13 pan. I do not spray my pan with anything. But if you know your pan sticks, spray it with Pam., If using the sausage or other veggies or topping, sprinkle that all over the top and get some in the crevices of the biscuit dough., Next take the chihuahua cheese, and cut into small cubes. I use chuhuahua because it gets super melty. I cut into cubes instead of shredding because the dough takes longer to bake up then cheese shreds take to melt. And I do cubes because the cheese melts slower and stays soft and gooey. Sprinkle tthe top with oregano and parsley., Bake for 35 minutes. Every oven will be different. I put mine in the center of the oven because that is where my oven gets the most even heat. I do not cover mine.Keep an eye on this how this bakes in your oven and make a note for next time. This is done when the cheese is melted, slightly golden brown and you want the center of this bake to be slightly firm and not too gooey and dough like., You can serve this right away by scooping it out and it will be gooey.

c8537eb5,https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/neapolitan-style-pizza-crust-recipe,Neapolitan-Style Pizza Crust,"2 cups (232g) King Arthur â00â Pizza Flour, 1/8 teaspoon instant yeast or active dry yeast, 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar, 1 1/4 teaspoons (8g) table salt, 3/4 cup (170g) water lukewarm (105Â° to 115Â°F)","To make the dough: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a medium bowl, mix the dry ingredients, then add the water. Stir until just combined, making a rough but cohesive dough.  ,           , , Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise at room temperature overnight, for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.Â After being mixed (left) this dough probably won't double in size; instead it will simply become a bit puffy (right).  ,           , Â , Place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat the oven to 500Â°F to 550Â°F (if your oven goes to 550Â°F) with a baking steel or stone inside. The position of the rack is important, particularly if you're using parchment paper â too close to the broiler (you need at least 8"" clearance) and the top of your pizza (and any visible edges of parchment) will burn before the bottom has had time to bake through. Make sure your oven is at the required temperature for at least 30 minutes before baking, so the steel or stone can fully preheat., To shape the dough: Divide the dough in half (about 200g per piece). Working with one piece at a time,Â transfer the dough to a well-floured surface.  ,           , , Stretch and fold it, as follows: holding onto the dough at both ends, pull one end away from the other, then fold it back onto itself. Repeat on the other side. The dough will likely be sticky â don't worry about it looking neat as you fold. Be sure to keep your hands floured as you work.  ,           , , Repeat this process on the other side of the dough, so that all four corners of the dough have been stretched and folded., Next,Â pull the ends of the dough towards the middle, then turn it over. Using your fingers, pull the dough under itself to make a smooth, round ball with the seams tucked into the bottom.Â   ,           , , Repeat with the second piece of dough, and place each ball seam-side down into a floured bowl., Cover the bowls and allow the dough to rise for 45 minutes to an hour, while your oven preheats. In colder weather, place the bowls on the stove top (above the preheating oven) to stay warm., Generously flour a wooden peel, rubbing flour into the board to completely coat. If you're using a metal peel, or if this is your first attempt at homemade pizza, place a piece of parchment on your peel instead of using flour., Scoop the risen dough onto a well-floured work surface seam-side down (a bowl scraper is helpful here), using care to shape it as roundÂ as possible for easier stretching. If the dough feels wet, use a generous dusting of flour on top. For dough that feels drier, use slightly less flour., Use your fingertips toÂ gently depress the dough, being careful not to touch the outer edge of the crust. This step is important â leaving the circumference untouched at this stage will result in a beautiful bubbly outer crust post-bake.  ,           , , Again, using care to not touch the outermost edge of the crust, lift the pizza from the work surface and use your knuckles to gently stretch the dough into a 10"" to 12"" circle. If the dough is at all sticky, use more flour. Use two hands at once to gently move the dough in a circle, allowing gravity to perform the stretch. Let gravity do most of the work for you, as pulling will stretch the center more than the edges. If you find your dough is difficult to stretch, set it down on a floured surface for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.  ,           , , Move the dough to the floured peel (or floured sheet of parchment) and adjust it so none is hanging off the edge. Remember â if the dough is sticky when you put it on the peel, it will stick to the peel! Make sure it's well-floured., If you're using parchment, trim the excess around the dough to prevent it from burning. To be safe we recommend trimming the paper flush with the dough, especially if your parchment's heat rating is below 500Â°F, as many are., Lightly sauce the dough, then top with the cheese of your choice. Add additional toppings as desired.  ,           , , If you're using a wooden peel, jiggle the uncooked pizza back and forth until it moves easily on the peel before quickly transferring it to the steel. If you're using parchment, gently slide the pizza and parchment onto the steel or stone. The parchment will blacken around any exposed edges but remain intact under the pizza., Bake the pizza for approximately 6 minutes on the steel or 7 minutes on the stone (give or take)., Turn on the ovenâs top broiler and continue cooking the pizza for 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbly and charred around the edges. Keep a close eye on the pizza at this stage and rotate it as needed to prevent burning on the top. If you only have a bottom broiler (in a drawer underneath the oven), don't use it â there's not enough clearance (see ""tips,"" below). But no worries; even if you can't use a broiler you can simply bake your pie for a few minutes longer, and with a steel or stone it will turn out just fine. When the pizza is done baking, remove it from the oven and top it with fresh basil leaves, if desired.Â   ,           , , Switch your oven back to bake mode and allow the steel or stone to reheat while you shape and top your second pizza. Bake the second pizza using the method described above (steps 17 through 19). Cool slightly before slicing and serving warm., Storage information: This Neapolitan-style pizza is best enjoyed fresh from the oven but can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Slices can be reheated in a 300Â°F oven for 5 to 10 minutes or until warm.","[('king arthur â00â pizza flour', 2.0, 'cups'), ('instant yeast', 0.0, 'teaspoon'), ('active dry yeast', 0.0, 'teaspoon'), ('granulated sugar', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('table salt', 1.25, 'teaspoons'), ('water', 3.75, 'cups')]"

Mix with your hands to activate the yeast., Slowly add flour to the mixture. Continue to mix with your hands., Once all the flour is in, add the salt. You want to spread out the time between the yeast going into the bowl and the salt going into the bowl. Work the dough and continue to add flour if you still have some., When the dough begins to form, turn the bowl over and let the dough sit on the bench. Add flour onto the bench and knead the dough into the flour, allowing it to absorb as much flour as it needs., Johnny recommends not sprinkling the flour on top but rather putting it in front of the dough on the bench so you can place the dough into the flour as you see fit., Continue to work the dough with pressure. Brace yourself with one foot and really put your muscle and heat into the dough. This part of the process takes anywhere between 15 and 25 minutes., To know if the dough is ready use the spring test in the middle of the dough lump or a digital thermometer (23-26 degrees C)., Once the dough is ready, cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least two hours on the bench, outside the fridge., After two hours, break the dough into six dough balls of equal size. There are many techniques to roll the dough balls, but make sure they are of similar or equal size., Put the dough balls into a container and let them rest outside the fridge for another 2-4 hours., You can also let the dough rest in the fridge. Wait for the dough balls to slightly double in size on the bench, then place them in the fridge overnight, and you can take them out 4-5 hours before making your pizzas., To make the pizza:, Preheat your oven to maximum heat (450-500 degrees Fahrenheit)., Take one of the dough balls and sprinkle with semolina. Stretch the dough out gently until it is flat with a rounded outer crust., Ladle tomato sauce and swirl outwards to coat the dough. Leave the outer crust free of tomato sauce., Add sliced mozzarella and fresh chopped basil., Drizzle with EVOO from the middle and circle outwards., Stretch the pizza a few more times and put it in the oven.

With floured hands, roll each portion into a ball, using the pinkie-edges of your hands to pinch the dough underneath each ball. If you are not baking the pizza the same day, transfer each round of dough to a plastic quart container (or something similar), cover, and store in the fridge. (At this point, transfer the vessels to the freezer for up to 3 months. See notes above for thawing.) If you are baking right away, let the balls sit on their tucked-in edges for at least 30 minutes without touching., To Make the Pizzas: If using refrigerated dough, pull out a pizza round from the fridge one hour (or even 90 minutes if time permits) before you plan on baking. Dust dough with flour and place on a floured work surface. Cover the dough with a towel or plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.

With your left hand flat in the center of the round, use your right hand to stretch the edge of the dough out, rotating as needed until it is an even 10-inches in diameter., Have your tomato sauce, drained cheese, pizza dough, olive oil, kosher salt, and basil leaves ready and close to the stovetop. Preheat broiler to high and arrange rack so you can just barely fit a 12-inch heavy-bottomed oven-proof cast iron or stainless steel skillet on top of it. Dust skillet with flour, tap out excess, then heat skillet over high heat until lightly smoking, about 3 minutes. Transfer 1 dough round to the skillet. It should fill up the entire bottom surface. Working quickly, spread 2 tablespoons sauce evenly over dough, leaving the outer 1-inch border un-sauced. Top with 1/6 of the cheese chunks. Season with kosher salt. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and scatter 4 basil leaves over the surface. Transfer skillet to broiler and broil until pizza is puffed and charred in spots (this can take anywhere between 1 1/2 to 4 minutes, depending on the strength of your broiler). Return skillet to stovetop and cook until bottom is charred in spots, using a thin metal spatula to peek after about 1 minute (depending on the skillet you use, you may skip this step if pizza is already charred). Transfer the pizza to a cutting board and serve immediately. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to bake remaining pizzas.","[('flour', 20.0, 'ounces'), ('salt', 0.3, 'ounces'), ('yeast', 0.2, 'ounces'), ('sugar', 0.2, 'ounces'), ('water', 12.0, 'ounces'), ('tomatoes', 14.0, 'ounces'), ('mozzarella', 12.0, 'ounces'), ('olive oil', 6.0, 'tablespoons')]"

Combine the starter ingredients together and let the starter rise for about 4h (it can take more or less time, depending on your starter and room temperature). It will be ready when it has risen to its peak (generally they rise by 50%) and it has just started to deflate., AUTOLYSE. Combine the flour blend and the psyllium husk in a large bowl. Mix extremely well, to make sure the psyllium husk is well distributed in the flour (I generally whisk it for a few seconds). About an hour before the starter is ready, add the water to the flour, combine well and move the dough to a container or bowl. Use a recipient that you can close properly with a top/cover to avoid drying., MIXING. When ready, pour or spoon 60g of the fed sourdough starter on the dough. Sprinkle the salt on top. Combine until well distributed, by alternating folding the dough over itself and pinching it often and vigorously between your thumb and index finger. (video available, see post), BULK FERMENTATION. Let the dough ferment at room temperature for 30 minutes, then move it to the refrigerator in a sealed container or bowl (it is important for the dough not to dry out). Ferment in the refrigerator for up to 36h, according to your schedule or your taste., [OPTIONAL] FOLDING. While the dough goes through the first 30 minutes of bulk fermentation at room temperature, apply two rounds of folds to the dough. Fold with wet hands, without flouring the dough or the counter. (video available, see post)., SHAPING. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for about 1h before shaping. For shaping, lightly dust your counter with rice flour. Gently ease the dough out of the bowl/container and onto the counter. Split the dough in two equal parts. For each piece of dough, first shape the dough into a ball. Then, heavily flour the counter and start pressing the dough down with your fingers, moving the dough away from its centre. When the dough starts to become thinner and delicate, say at 10cm diameter, move it onto a floured sheet of parchment paper. Finish shaping the pizza pressing the dough away from its centre with your fingers. Flour it lightly when you feel it is too sticky. Your finished pizza will have at least a diameter of 27cm. You will wind up with two shaped pizzas on two separate parchment paper sheets. Video with shaping instructions available (see link in the article)., PROOFING. Cover the pizzas with an upside-down large bowl or with a baking sheet, or alternatively with cling film (be gentle). Let them proof for 1h to 4h (see article for tips)., TOPPING. If using passata, mix the passata with olive oil, oregano, and salt to taste. If using canned plum tomatoes, first pour them on a sieve to drain the extra water. Squash the tomatoes by hand into a sauce or blitz them in a blender. Add olive oil, oregano, and salt to taste. Drain the mozzarella from its brine and shred it into medium-small pieces. When the pizza is ready to be baked, spoon some tomato sauce on it and spread it using the bottom part of the spoon. Add until the pizza is lightly covered (do not overdo it). Add the shredded mozzarella on top. Optional: brush the crust with olive oil or neutral vegetable oil to obtain more colour (especially if not using the blend with WPI)., BAKING. 1h before baking, put the pizza stone on a middle shelf/tray of your oven and pre-heat it at maximum temperature for 45min to 1h. For the last 15 minutes, also turn the grill function on in your oven (I use grill + fan function). Prepare a landing area for your pizza stone (this could simply be your stove). Once the oven is hot, pull the tray with the pizza stone out of the oven. Very carefully lift the pizza by the parchment paper and move it onto the stone. Carefully cut extra parchment if there is excessive overhang. Put the stone back into the oven (middle shelf) and bake at maximum temperature and grill function on for 10 minutes. Optional: 5 to 6 minutes into the baking, pull the stone out and gently pull the parchment from underneath the pizza. Check the pizza often and turn the grill function off if you feel you are burning it. If you feel it is still to gooey in the middle after 10 minutes, give it 2 more minutes., SERVING. When ready, serve the pizza directly, or let it rest a few minutes on a plate or on a rack. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil on top and a couple of fresh basil leaves.","[('gf sourdough starter', 25.0, 'g'), ('water', 25.0, 'g'), ('gf flour', 25.0, 'g'), ('gf flour blend', 300.0, 'g'), ('filtered water', 340.0, 'g'), ('mature gf sourdough starter*', 60.0, 'g'), ('psyllium husks', 15.0, 'g'), ('salt', 6.5, 'g'), ('canned tomatoes', 200.0, 'g'), ('mozzarella', 1.0, None), ('dry oregano', None, None), ('olive oil', None, None), ('salt', None, None), ('basil leaves', None, None)]"

To the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook, add the warmed milk and melted butter. Feel the mixture with your finger (make sure you feel in the center of the milk/butter mixture) and make sure it is not too hot. You want the temperature to feel like a baby's bathwater. If it is too hot, let it cool a bit before proceeding., Add the sugar and instant yeast to the milk/butter mixture. Stir. Look for the yeasty smell that tells you the yeast is activating (should happen within 10-20 seconds) and then proceed with the recipe., Add the eggs, salt and a cup of flour. Turn on the dough hook on in your stand mixer and continue adding the flour a cup at a time until you have added 5 cups of flour. Knead for 1 minute until all the flour is fully incorporated. Check the dough by rolling it into a ball in your fingers to see if you need more flour. If the dough is too sticky to roll into a ball, continue adding flour 1/4 cup at a time, kneading for 1 minute after each addition. This process will make sure you don't over-flour the dough. Once you can pinch off a piece of dough and roll it into a ball with just a little sticky residue on your fingers, you can stop adding flour. Knead for a total of 5-7 minutes., Lightly oil (or spray with cooking spray) a large container and dump the dough in the container. Cover lightly with a kitchen towel and set in a warm place to rise.

Set aside., Assembling the Cinnamon Rolls, Prepare two half sheet pans (18 by 13 inches) and cover with parchment paper., Once the dough has doubled in size, move it from the bowl to a clean space on the counter. The dough will be soft and not overly sticky. Pat the dough out into an approximate 18 by 12 rectangle., Spread the cinnamon filling all over the dough with your fingers, making sure to cover up to the edges of the cinnamon roll., Starting with the dough closest to you, roll up the cinnamon roll and pinch together the seam. Flip the cinnamon roll over, seam side down., Cut the long log of cinnamon roll dough into 12 equal pieces., Place the cinnamon rolls on the parchment paper, six or eight to a pan, leaving plenty of space to rise.

Then rotate the pan and bake for another 8-10 minutes until just starting to brown., Check the middle of one of the cinnamon rolls by using a butter knife to pry up a bit of the roll and make sure it is baked to your liking (the center will tell you if it needs more time or is perfectly baked)., Let the rolls cool for 5 minutes before covering with frosting., Freeze any extra frosted cinnamon rolls in a ziplock bag.
