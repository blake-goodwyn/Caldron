Line the bottoms of two 9"" cake pans with parchment (do not grease)., In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisk, beat 6 eggs on high speed 1 min until foamy. Gradually add 1 cup sugar then continue beating on high for 8 min. It will be whipped and forming thick ribbons when you pull up the whisk.*, In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 cup flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder., Sift flour into batter 1/3 at a time, folding between each addition, just until no flour streaks remain. Scrape from the bottom to catch any hidden flour pockets. Divide evenly between prepared cake pans and bake at 350˚F for 23-28 min (my oven takes 25 min). Tops should be golden brown and spring back when poked lightly., Run a knife or thin spatula around edges to loosen and invert onto wire rack. Peel back parchment paper right away and let cakes cool right-side-up to room temp before cutting them in half., How to Make Cream Cheese Frosting:, In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, combine 16 oz cream cheese, 1 cup butter, 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar and 2 tsp vanilla. Beat on low to combine then increase to high and beat 5-6 mins, scraping down the bowl as needed. Frosting should be whipped, soft and spreadable. Transfer 1 cup frosting to piping bag fitted with large open star tip and refrigerate until ready to use for the topping., How to Cut Mango:, A mango has one long, flat seed in the center of the fruit that goes from stem to nose. Slice off the sides around the seeds of all 4 whole mangos resulting in 8 halves. Set aside 4 halves - you will need them to decorate the top. Dice remaining 4 halves and scoop them out of their skin then transfer these to a blender and process until puréed. Taste the mango purée and add sugar to taste if needed., How to Assemble the Mango Cake:, Place the first sliced cake layer on a platter and spread with 1/2 cup mango purée. On the second cake layer, spread 1/2 cup frosting and place it frosting-side-down on the first layer so the cream and mango are hugging. Repeat with remaining layers then cover top and sides with remaining frosting. Pipe reserved frosting around the top border of your cake., Peel and thinly slice 4 reserved mango halves, cutting some strips long way and some wide. Layer mango slices in rings around the cake, starting with the longest pieces and overlapping each piece slightly until only a 1/2"" space is left in the center. Roll a long thin strip of mango into a coil and place it in the center. Cake can be served right away or refrigerated 2 hours for easier slicing. It keeps well covered and refrigerated up to 3 days.","[('eggs', 6.0, 'large'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('flour', 1.0, 'cup'), ('baking powder', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('mangos', 1.0, 'lb'), ('mangos', 1.5, 'cups'), ('sugar', 4.0, 'tbsp'), ('cream cheese', 16.0, 'oz'), ('butter', 1.0, 'cup'), ('powdered sugar', 2.5, 'cups'), ('vanilla extract', 2.0, 'tsp')]"

Fold the mixture so all the dry ingredients are completely combined., Add your melted chocolate, yoghurt and boiling water. Carefully mix together until fully combined., Divide your mixture evenly between your 3 tins and bake four about 20-25 minutes each. Check with a skewer to check they are cooked. I bake two of the sponges and then the third afterwards as I like to bake them all on the middle shelf., Once baked, allow the cakes to cool in their tins., Now to make the buttercream. Place your butter in a stand mixer (or electric hand whisk if you don't have a stand mixer), mix on its own on a high speed for about 5 minutes. The butter should change from a more yellow colour to being a lot more pale., Add your icing sugar in 3-4 stages. Mixing for about 3 minutes between each addition., Blitz or crush your gluten free and dairy free 'Oreos' so that they are really fine., Add your 'Oreo' crumbs to the buttercream and mix together to combine., Add 2-3 tbsp of milk to loosen the buttercream slightly if needed (probably not needed if using dairy free margarine etc), Time to assemble your cake! Place the first sponge onto a cake stand/plate and spread icing on top of it - then add your second sponge on top of that. Spread icing once again and finish by placing your final sponge on top. Don't use up all your icing in between each sponge layer - be modest with it!, Apply a really thin layer of icing (using your plastic icing scraper) all over the outside of your cake - this is the crumb coat. You can achieve this by applying the icing all over and then scraping it off again as much as possible. Place the cake in the fridge for 30 minutes., Once the crumb coat has locked in the crumbs, you can begin applying the icing and scraping it smooth. I do this with a cranked palette knife all over, then scraping it smooth. See the video links in the blog post above for the best ways on how to do this - it's hard to describe purely in writing!, Then make your drip - really simple. Melt your chocolate in the microwave and then thoroughly mix in your oil. Allow to cool a tiny bit (about 5-10 minutes) before using., Using a piping bag, apply your drip around the edge of the top of your cake at around 1 cm intervals. Make each drip a varying length if you can! Then use the rest of your drip to cover the top of the cake., Finish with crushed gluten free 'Oreos' and you're done!

Grease and line two cake tins measuring 20cms/8”. (Or one cake tin of the same diameter, but deeper), Whisk all of the cake ingredients together, except the hot water, until light and fluffy for at least 3 minutes. Then add the hot water and whisk again for 3 minutes until the cake mixture is extremely light and fluffy., Divide the cake mixture between the two prepared cake tins (or one cake tin if using) and bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the cakes are firm to touch and well risen. (You can also check by inserting a skewer into the middle of the cakes, and if the skewer is clean when taken out, the cakes are cooked), Allow the cakes to cool in the tin for a few minutes, before carefully turning them out on to a wire cooking rack. Allow to cool completely before filling and icing., Meanwhile, make the icing/frosting. Sit a bowl over a pan of simmering water and add the Galaxy chocolate and cream to the bowl and gently melt, stirring all the time until the chocolate and cream are blended and smooth., Remove the chocolate and cream from the heat, then add the butter to the hot chocolate and cream mixture, stir it until smooth. Sift in half the icing sugar and mix well, add the remaining icing sugar and mix until very creamy and smooth. Set aside to cool until thickened., When you are ready to ice and fill the cakes, spread half of the icing/frosting over one of the cakes, and then place the other cake on top. (If using the walnuts, sprinkle the chopped walnuts over the icing before placing the cake on top), Gently swirl the rest of the icing/frosting over the top of the cake, pipe it on if you wish, and then decorate with walnuts if using.

Beat in the eggs one at a time - don't worry if it curdles a little, the flour will fix it., Mix in the flour until you have a smooth batter., Carefully spread the cake mixture over the pineapple and caramel layer to the edges of the dish. You need to take care not to move the pineapple pieces out of place or it will ruin the pattern., Bake for 25 minutes and then check. It should be golden brown, and springy to the touch. If you think it needs a little longer, return for 5 more minutes., When you take it out of the oven, set on a place mat and place a plate (that is larger than the flan dish) up side down on top of the flan. Using oven gloves or tea towels to protect your hands, carefully flip the flan dish over and remove the metal. You should now have the cake up side down, so the pineapple shows on top., Leave the cake to cool.

Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed during this process. Add the vanilla and beat once more until combined. Fold in the remaining flour. Remove the mixing bowl from the mixer and pour in the remaining flour. Slowly fold in the flour until combined. Do not overmix or you will end up with a dense cake that isn't airy. The batter will be thick. Add in 5-6 teaspoons of hot water to get it to the right consistency., Divide the batter into the cake pans evenly.

Add in the flour, cocoa powder, beaten eggs, baking powder and beat again briefly till combined – try not to over beat the mixture! If its really thick, mix in the whole milk to loosen., Divide the mixture between the three tins and smooth it over – bake for 25-30 minutes until a skewer comes out clean when poked, and when the cake springs back., Once baked, leave the cake to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, and then remove and leave to cool fully on a wire rack. If the cake has domed slightly, leave the cake to cool upside down to flatten it slightly., For the Decoration!, In a stand mixer, beat the room temperature butter with an electric mixer until it is smooth and loose and then beat in the icing sugar 1/3 at a time until its fully combined. Keep beating the buttercream for a few minutes so it starts to get fluffier and lighter., In a food processor, blitz the packet of Oreo’s to a fine crumb, and add into the buttercream. Beat the buttercream again till smooth, and use the Milk to loosen it to a smooth consistency., Once the cakes are cooled, put the first layer on the serving plate spread some of the buttercream onto the top of the first layer, add the second cake on top, and then top again with some of buttercream and then add the final sponge layer. Only use about 2 tbsps of buttercream per layer so that you have enough to decorate with!, With the leftover buttercream, as you can see, I covered the sides (and top) too!

Repeat again with a slightly thicker layer of buttercream., I slather it on all over using an off -set spatula, and then run the metal scraper round until its smooth. If the Oreo’s were blitzed to a really fine crumb like you need, the buttercream can still be smooth around the edges even though there is biscuit in the mix!, Once finished, melt the dark chocolate in a heat proof bowl until melted. Add in 1tbsp of oil and beat till smooth, continue to add oil till you get to a drippy consistency. I used 1+1/2 tbsps total. Using disposable piping bags, pipe it round the edge of the cake, edging over slight bits to create the drip., You don’t need to use too much per drip as it’ll drop quite far down by itself! Fill in the top in with the rest of the chocolate so the top is also covered.

Start by soaking the pistachios in cold water for about 1-2 hours. This will soften the skin enough to just simply pinch off with ease, Once the skins have been removed, pat all the pistachios dry with a paper towel, Then transfer the pistachios to a pan on a low heat and toast for around 10 minutes, or place into the oven at 100'C/210'F and roast for 10-20 minutes, Next take the pistachios and place into a blender along with the milk, Blend till completely smooth and the colour changes. No need to pass the pistachio milk through a cheesecloth for this recipe (as you would for other nut milks), Pre-heat your oven to 130'C (fan)/150'C (conventional) - 265'F/300'F, Start by heating the 2tbsp of milk in a microwave till steaming. Add the saffron to the milk and allow to infuse. The longer it's left to infuse, the more flavour it imparts, but I'd recommend 15-30 minutes as the minimum, Then in a separate bowl, mix the ground flaxseeds/linseeds with 3tbsp of cold water and set aside for 10-15 minutes to hydrate, Add the oil, sugar, vanilla, almond extract, cardamom, and the hydrated flax/linseeds to a large mixing bowl. The almond extract helps to bring out the pistachio flavour. You could also use pistachio extract however I've found these to have quite an artificial flavour, Briefly whisk everything together. Then pour in all of the pistachio milk as well as the saffron infused milk, and whisk everything together well, Next sift in the flour, baking powder, and salt, Whisk everything together till smooth - it shouldn't take long at all. Try and avoid over whisking, that can lead to a tough and dense cake, Fold in all of the chopped pistachios into the batter, Grease a 27cm/10.5"" bundt tin with butter followed by a dusting of flour to ensure your cake comes out with ease after baking, Pour all the pistachio cake batter into the tin and then tap on the counter 2-3x to remove any large air bubbles. Bake for 1hr 15 minutes (75 minutes), then increase the oven temperature to 170'C (fan)/190'C (conventional) - 340'F/375'F and bake for a further 15 minutes. This will allow for browning, Once baked, allow the cake to cool for 25 minutes in the bundt tin, then flip over on to a wire rack. Give the tin a gentle tap all around to help loosen the cake, Lift the bundt tin away and allow the cake to cool completely, Whisk together the icing sugar, rose syrup, and milk till completely smooth. I'd recommend adding the milk a little at a time to ensure you get the perfect consistency. You may need a little less or a little more milk. I like a thin crackly glaze, however you can reduce the milk in the glaze if you prefer a thicker finish, Place the cooled pistachio bundt cake on a wire rack with a tray underneath. Spoon over the glaze all around, and you can spoon over the excess the drips off back on to the bundt cake too, Finish with chopped pistachios and dried rose petals.

I remove and frost the cake while frozen, just because it's easier for me. To make the ""naked"" frosting look, I layered the frosting in the centers of the layers, then spread some on the sides but used a large spatula to scrape most of it off. As soon as I frosted the cakes, I threw white sparkle sprinkles on it (like these). Right before setting it out, you can top with the sugared cranberries and rosemary., cream cheese frosting, In the bowl of an electric mixer, mix the butter and cream cheese on medium speed until smooth. Gradually add in the powdered sugar with the mixer on low speed, increasing the speed once all of the sugar is added. Add in the vanilla extract, then beat on medium to medium-high speed for a good 2 to 3 minutes until creamy, scraping down the sides if needed. If you find the frosting it a bit too thick, add in some milk 1 teaspoon at a time until desired consistency is reached., I love how this frosting works on cakes once they are refrigerated! It's delicious., sugared cranberries, Add 1 cup of the sugar and the water to a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk until the sugar dissolves and bring the mixture to a boil, cooking for 2 to 3 minutes. Set it aside until it is cool enough to touch. Once the syrup is cool, either dunk the cranberries in it or pour the liquid over top of them in a bowl. Place the remaining sugar on a plate.

Combine the plant based milk and lemon juice and stir. Set aside to curdle., Preheat the oven to 350°F/175°C. Make three parchment paper rounds for three 6x2-inch (15 x 5 cm) round cake pans and line each pan. Alternatively, you can use two 8-inch (20 x 5 cxm) round pans. Ensure your oven is calibrated or that you’re using an oven thermometer (see notes above in the “equipment needed for baking a vegan layer cake” section)., Prepare the aquafaba. Pour 1/2 cup of the liquid from a can of chickpeas into a small bowl. With a handheld electric mixer (or stand mixer), beat the aquafaba on medium speed until it‘s foamy throughout, about 60 seconds., Whisk together the dry ingredients. Add the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder to a medium bowl and whisk well to ensure the leaveners will be evenly distributed throughout the cake., Cream the wet ingredients. Add the softened butter, oil, and cane sugar to a large bowl. Using the mixer, beat until the ingredients are well incorporated and starting to get fluffy, 60 seconds or so. Add in the whipped aquafaba, vanilla extract, orange juice (if using), and orange zest (if using). Mix until just combined, 15-20 seconds., Add half of the flour mixture into the butter-sugar mixture, beating on low speed until just combined, taking care to not over beat. Then add the vegan buttermilk and beat until just combined. Finally, add in the remaining flour mixture until you have a mostly smooth batter, but do not overmix. It’s okay if there are a few flour pockets remaining. Overbeating can cause the cake to become dense or dry. The batter should be fairly light and fluffy at this point., Divide the batter equally in the prepared pans, using a digital scale to measure each pan so each cake is equal in size. The batter in each of my three 6-inch pans ended up weighing 440 grams each. Scatter the raspberries evenly over the top of each cake, but do not press them down., Bake 6 x 2 inch (15 x 5 cm) cakes for 30 minutes, or until the center is set and the cake has puffed up a bit and just started to pull away from the pan, and a toothpick inserted comes out with only a few moist crumbs. If you are using two 8 x 2 inch (20 x 5 cm) cakes, bake for 30-35 minutes.Note: I recommend checking 5 minutes before the time is up, as every oven is different and it might be done sooner., Cool the cakes in their pans for at least 30 minutes, then carefully invert them onto a cooling rack. Cool completely before adding assembling the cakes., Assemble the cakes: If you have the time, I recommend refrigerating the cakes and frosting (see the section above called “Assembly”).a. Place one layer cake on a cake platter or plate. Spread a thin layer of the Raspberry Jam on top. Then add 1/4 of the Tangy Buttercream Frosting and smooth with an offset spatula. Top with the next layer cake. And repeat the process, adding more jam and frosting. Finish with the final layer cake, adding jam and frosting on top.b. Using the offset spatula, apply the remaining buttercream to the sides of each cake layer, starting at the bottom, working your way up to the top. For a naked cake look, you just want a thin layer.c. When the sides are covered, use a bench scraper to smooth the sides and to achieve the naked cake look.d. Using the offset spatula, smooth out the top layer of frosting until it’s level. You can serve now, or refrigerate for 1-2 hours to set the cake., Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for a few days.","[('vegan butter', 112.0, 'g'), ('plant-based milk', 330.0, 'ml'), ('lemon juice', 15.0, 'ml'), ('aquafaba', 120.0, 'ml'), ('all-purpose flour', 420.0, 'g'), ('sunflower oil', 112.0, 'g'), ('organic cane sugar', 240.0, 'g'), ('pure vanilla extract', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('orange juice', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('orange zest', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('fresh raspberries', 240.0, 'g'), ('raspberry jam', None, None), ('buttercream frosting', None, None)]"

Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula again and ensure batter is uniform and smooth (don’t over-beat after adding the eggs or cheesecake will be prone to cracking and the texture could end up less smooth than desired)., Pour batter into prepared springform pan and transfer to the center rack of 325F (165C) oven. Bake for 35 minutes or until cheesecake is set. The center may jiggle slightly when finished baking, but the surface should be set if lightly touched with your finger.

Note: If cakes are domed or not even, I recommend leveling with a cake leveler or sharp knife before assembling., For Frosting, Using an electric mixer or stand mixer, beat together butter and cream cheese until smooth and well-combined., Stir in vanilla extract and salt., With mixer on low-speed, gradually add powdered sugar until completely combined., Divide frosting in half (you can just eyeball it) and add stir cocoa powder into one half of the frosting until combined., Assembly, Place your first cake layer on cake platter and cover with a layer of chocolate frosting., Remove the collar from the springform pan and, if needed, use a sharp knife to level the cheesecake (sometimes the edges rise slightly, use a knife to trim these off)., Carefully invert or place the cooled cheesecake on top of the first layer of icing, lining up the center of the cheesecake with the center of the cake (sometimes I find my cheesecake is slightly wider than the cake, line it up as best you can and the icing on the outside will make up for any differences in width when you decorate)., Cover the cheesecake with another layer of chocolate frosting, then top with remaining chocolate cake layer. Note: At this point I recommend doing a crumb coating, or a very thin layer of frosting smoothed all over the cake to catch all the crumbs, then refrigerate or freeze uncovered for 10-15 minutes before proceeding., Generously smear large, thick patches of frosting over the cake, alternating chocolate and white patches. Use a straightedge or spatula to smooth frosting around the cake.

Add 3 ¼ cups of the vanilla batter to the cocoa mixture and beat until smooth and uniform in color., Fold the rainbow sprinkles into the vanilla cake batter using a rubber spatula., Using ¼ cup measures, or trigger ice cream scoops (2 oz. capacity), portion ¼ cup of vanilla-sprinkle dough into the center of the pans. Next, spoon ¼ cup of chocolate batter into each center, directly on top of the vanilla-sprinkle batter. Continue this process, spooning the batter into the center of the pans and occasionally rapping the bottom of the pan on the countertop to level the batters together. Do this until all the batter is used and they appear as concentric rings in the pans., Bake the cakes for 35-40 minutes (mine too slightly longer, at 45 minutes) until the centers are domed and puffy. A toothpick tester should come out mostly clean (mine had some color on it due to a melted confetti sprinkle.) Transfer the pans to a wire rack to cool 10 minutes, then turn out to cool completely on wire racks. After cooling the cakes, level them with a serrated knife. They can also be wrapped in plastic film and transferred to the refrigerator to stand overnight. I find that the crust softens and they are easier to level after a night in the refrigerator., Swiss meringue buttercream, Place a saucepan filled 1/3 full of water over medium heat. Bring to a simmer., In a large stainless-steel bowl, combine the egg white, sugar, and salt. Set the bowl over the simmering water and cook while whisking intermittently. Cook until the mixture is hot (110°F) and you can no longer feel sugar granules when the mixture is rubbed between your finger and thumb. Transfer the hot mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on high speed for 5-7 minutes or until a thick, shiny meringue forms that holds stiff peaks. The bowl should feel cool to the touch. If it doesn’t, refrigerate the meringue in the bowl for 10 minutes. Return the bowl to the mixer and swap the whisk attachment for the paddle attachment., Beat the room temperature butter into the meringue one cube at a time on medium-low speed, waiting to add the next cube when the previous cube disappears. The batter will deflate with the butter addition, and may even look curdled (if the butter was the slightest bit cold this happens), but this is normal. When all of the butter is added, beat the mixture on high speed until light in color and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the vanilla extract., Place a cake layer on a cake board or serving plate. Fill the cake with about 1 ¼ cups of the buttercream. Top with a second cake. Cover the entire cake with the buttercream, and smooth evenly over the tops and sides. Refrigerate the frosted cake until the buttercream firms, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the ganache drip., Ganache drip, Place the chips and cream in a microwave-safe bowl and heat at 100% power for 45 seconds to 1 minute. Allow the mixture to stand 1 minute, then whisk together to create a smooth ganache. Add the corn syrup, if using. Allow the mixture to cool slightly. Remove the cake from the refrigerator and spoon some of the ganache over the sides of the cake. Use the spoon to nudge the chocolate over the edges to drip down the sides. Pour the remaining ganache in the top center of the cake and smooth to cover it completely., Garnish the top edge of the cake with more rainbow confetti sprinkles. Top with a cute zebra figurine, if you’re so inclined., Store the cake in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before serving.","[('flour', 4.0, 'cups'), ('baking powder', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('kosher salt', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('egg whites', 7.0, None), ('egg yolks', 3.0, None), ('granulated sugar', 2.5, 'cups'), ('whole milk', 2.0, 'cups'), ('butter', 0.5, 'cups'), ('sunflower oil', 0.33, 'cups'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('cocoa powder', 0.5, 'cups'), ('sprinkles', 0.5, 'cups'), ('egg whites', 5.0, None), ('granulated sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('salt', 0.0, None), ('butter', 1.0, 'lb'), ('vanilla extract', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('chocolate chips', 0.5, 'cups'), ('heavy cream', 0.25, 'cups'), ('corn syrup', 1.0, 'tablespoon')]"

Remove the pan carefully.

Attach the whisk, combine ingredients on low and then whip on high for 5 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and salt., Add in your softened butter in chunks and whip with the whisk attachment to combine. It will look curdled at first. This is normal. It will also look pretty yellow. Keep whipping., Whip on high for 8-10 minutes until it's very white, light and shiny. If you don't whip it enough, it could end up tasting buttery., Optional: If you want whiter frosting, add in a tiny drop of purple to counteract the yellow in the butter (too much will make the frosting grey or light purple.), Optional: Switch to a paddle attachment and mix on low for 15-20 minutes to make the buttercream very smooth and remove air bubbles. This isn't required but if you want really creamy frosting, you don't want to skip it., After your cakes are chilled, fill them with your favorite frosting and frost the outside.

Set aside., In a large bowl with an electric mixer (or in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment), cream together the butter, sugar and lemon zest until light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes., Add the eggs and vanilla and mix until well-combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed., In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, soda and salt.

Gradually pour in half of the sugar. Mix the whites on high speed until stiff peaks form. Set aside., In the other bowl with the yolks, add the remaining sugar and use the same whisk attachment to beat the yolks until they are pale and fluffy., Combine the milk, melted butter, vanilla extract and lemon zest in a bowl or cup.

Set aside to cool., Frosting:, In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment or using a hand mixer, mix the cream cheese and powdered sugar until evenly mixed, smooth and fluffy. Add the lemon zest, vanilla extract and limoncello., Add the mascarpone cheese. You can just fold in the mascarpone cheese with a rubber spatula, since it’s soft enough or mix with the mixer just until combined, about 30 seconds., In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until fluffy and stiff peaks form. You can do this by hand using a whisk or use a hand held mixer or a standing mixer., Using a rubber spatula, fold in the whipped cream into the frosting until evenly mixed., Assembling the Cake:, Cut each cake in half horizontally., Using a serrated knife, make a small cut all around the outside of the cake. This will keep your knife on the same level as you are cutting across. Continue cutting deeper into the cake until you have cut all the way through., Another trick I use when decorating cakes is to line the serving plate all around the edge with aluminum foil so that the edge of the cake is overlapping the aluminum foil by about 1/2 inch. This will catch all the drips and crumbs, leaving your serving plate neat and clean. When you’re done decorating just carefully pull the aluminum foil out., Using a pastry brush, brush the top and bottom of each layer with the limoncello syrup., Put a dollop of frosting in the center of the cake plate, which will help to hold the cake in place. Place the first cake layer in the center of the cake plate and generously spread the cake layer with frosting, all the way to the edges., Place the second cake layer on top of the frosted cake layer. Spread the lemon curd evenly over the surface of the cake, all the way to the edges. You can use more or less lemon curd, depending on how sweet and “lemony” you want the cake to be., Place the third cake layer on top of the lemon curd layer and generously spread the cake layer with frosting, all the way to the edges., Top with the last layer and this time frost the sides and the top of the cake. Carefully pull out the aluminum foil from underneath the edges of the cake and discard., You will have enough frosting left over to pipe a border all the way around the cake too.

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously spray three 8-inch cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottom of each with a parchment paper circle. Spray the parchment, too., Mix the dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt., Whisk the wet ingredients, then mix in the dry ingredients and coffee. In a large bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla. Gradually whisk in the dry ingredients until just combined. Slowly pour in the coffee. The batter will be fairly runny; use a rubber spatula to scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl. Use the rubber spatula to finish mixing until smooth and well combined, 2 to 3 minutes more., Divide the cake batter between the pans. Divide the batter evenly between the pans; if using a digital scale to measure out layers, note that this recipe makes around 72 ounces (2041 grams) of batter—pour 24 ounces (680 grams) of batter into each cake pan., Bake and cool the cakes. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes. When done, the top of the cake should bounce back when gently pressed and a skewer inserted into the center of the cake should come out with a few crumbs attached. Cool completely in the pans on a wire rack before frosting., For the Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting, Make the frosting. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, cream cheese, and vanilla. Beat on medium-low until soft and creamy, about 1 minute. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.With the mixer on low, add the cocoa powder and corn syrup. Beat on medium until combined. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl. With the mixer on low, gradually add the confectioners' sugar and salt. Beat until combined, then add the milk and beat until just incorporated.Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl once more, then beat on medium-high until the frosting is creamy and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Use immediately., Assembly, Prep the cake layers for assembly. If necessary, level the top of the cakes. Place one of the cake layers on a cake board or serving platter in the center of a rotating cake stand. This will be the first layer of the cake., Build the layers. Use a rubber spatula or cookie dough scoop to drop a slightly heaping ½ cup of the frosting in the middle of the first cake layer. Use an offset spatula to spread it evenly all over the top, just like you would spread butter on toast. Place the second cake on top of this frosting, stacking it evenly on top of the first layer. Use the rubber spatula or cookie dough scoop to drop another ½ cup of the frosting in the middle of this cake layer. Spread it evenly all over the top. Finally, place the third cake on top of this layer, stacking it evenly on top of the first two cakes., Next, crumb coat the cake. Use the offset spatula to cover the surface of the entire layer cake with a thin layer of frosting. Use just enough frosting to cover the entire cake completely. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 10 to 15 minutes to stiffen and ""set"" the frosting., After the crumb coat sets, finish frosting the cake. Transfer about ¼ to ⅓ cup of the remaining frosting to a piping bag fitted with a star tip. Use the offset spatula to cover the cake with the remaining frosting. Once the cake is completely covered, hold the twines of a fork against the frosting as you rotate the cake stand to smoothen it. Alternatively, you can use the offset spatula to create swirls or patterned lines in the frosting., Decorate the cake. Use the piping bag to pipe a border around the top edge of the cake—doing so results in an empty circle in the middle of the frosting. Fill the circle with sprinkles., Serve and store. Serve immediately. The assembled chocolate birthday cake can be stored at room temperature, under a cake dome or a large bowl turned upside down, for up to 1 day. Press a sheet of plastic wrap against any cut surfaces to prevent the cake from drying out. After that, cover the entire cake loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days.","[('cake flour', 3.0, 'cups'), ('granulated sugar', 3.0, 'cups'), ('cocoa powder', 1.0, 'cup'), ('baking soda', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('baking powder', 1.5, 'teaspoons'), ('kosher salt', 1.5, 'teaspoons'), ('buttermilk', 1.5, 'cups'), ('canola oil', 0.75, 'cup'), ('eggs', 3.0, 'large'), ('vanilla extract', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('coffee', 1.5, 'cups'), ('unsalted butter', 1.0, 'cup'), ('cream cheese', 0.75, 'cup'), ('cocoa powder', 1.0, 'cup'), ('light corn syrup', 4.0, 'teaspoons'), ('confectioners sugar', 7.0, 'cups'), ('kosher salt', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('whole milk', 6.0, 'tablespoons')]"

Grease the entire pan with butter and place parchment paper that is cut out to fit the bottom of the pan., Next, preheat your oven to 350°F (325°F if you're using a convection oven)., After that, sift the dry ingredients (flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt) into a bowl. Whisk them together to combine by using a hand whisker or electric mixer. Set aside until ready for use., Whisk the eggs and sugar with a stand mixer until fluffy and pale in color, for about 15 minutes., Tip: This step is very important. Not whipping the egg mixture long enough will yield dense, hard, and heavy cake sponges. The mixture should flow off the whisk attachment very slowly like a thick ribbon, Next, add the flour mixture in 3 separate additions. Use a hand whisker or silicon spatula to fold it in very carefully, and try not to deflate air pockets as much as possible., Divide the batter into two separate baking pans and bake., Baking Pans and Baking Time, This recipe requires using two cake pans. Using smaller baking pans will result in 2 tall cake sponges that you can easily cut into 2 layers each and assemble into a 4-layer cake., Two 8-inch cake pans' baking time is 35 minutes., Two 10-inch cake pans' baking time is 25 minutes., Bake in a preheated 350°F (325°F if using convection) oven, on the middle rack for the time specified above, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Do not open the oven sooner than 15 minutes into the baking process, this will disturb the cake rising and the cake sponges will not be tall and fluffy., After the cake sponges are done baking, remove both cake pans from the oven. Allow the cakes to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before transferring them onto a cooling rack., Invert the sponge cakes onto the cooling rack, and peel off the parchment paper from the base of each cake. Allow them to cool completely before using them for any recipe that calls for a chocolate cake.","[('eggs', 8.0, None), ('sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('flour', 1.0, 'cup'), ('cocoa', 0.5, 'cup'), ('baking soda', 0.5, 'tsp.'), ('baking powder', 0.5, 'tsp.'), ('salt', 1.0, 'pinch')]"

Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly coat the bottom and sides of 3 (8-inch) cake pans with butter, then line the bottoms with rounds of parchment paper and smooth the parchment to eliminate air bubbles., In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the cake flour, granulated sugar, salt, baking soda and baking powder; mix on low speed just until combined., Bloom the cocoa: In a medium bowl, whisk to combine the cocoa powder and hot coffee. Add the crème fraîche and vanilla, then whisk until completely smooth. Set aside., In a separate medium bowl, whisk the 5 whole eggs and 2 yolks until smooth; set aside., Mix the batter: To the stand mixer bowl, add the oil and half of the cocoa mixture; mix on low speed just until the flour is completely coated in the liquid ingredients. Pause the mixer and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl, then mix on medium until smooth and pasty, about 30 seconds. Pause and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl again, then add the whisked eggs and remaining cocoa mixture. Beat on medium speed, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl once or twice, until the batter is very silky and has the consistency of thin pancake batter, about 1 minute., Pour the batter into the prepared pans, dividing evenly. (For uniform layers, use a scale – you’ll get about 550 grams of batter per pan.) Transfer the pans to the oven, positioning two on the upper rack and one on the lower, staggering them so the pans above don’t block the one below. Bake, rotating the top two pans side to side and rack to rack after 20 minutes, until the tops of the cakes are domed, springy to the touch and a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the centers comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes., Remove the pans from the oven and let cool completely on a wire rack., To make the buttercream, start with the pudding base: Place the chocolate in the clean bowl of the stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. In a small saucepan, combine the milk and ¼ cup/50 grams of the sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar, then remove from the heat and set aside. In a medium bowl, add the cocoa powder, flour, salt and remaining 1/4 cup/50 grams sugar, and whisk until combined. Add the yolks to the bowl and whisk slowly to combine (it will seem very thick at first, but will loosen up), then whisk more vigorously until the mixture is pale, thick and smooth. Whisking the yolk mixture constantly, slowly stream in about half of the warm milk mixture, then whisk the contents of the bowl back into the saucepan. Set the saucepan over medium-low heat and cook, whisking constantly and scraping against the sides, until thick and bubbling, 1 to 3 minutes. Immediately scrape the pudding over the chocolate in the stand mixer bowl., Make the buttercream: Let the pudding mixture sit for a few minutes, so the heat gently melts the chocolate, then mix with the paddle on low speed until the chocolate is completely melted and the pudding is smooth and glossy. Increase the speed to medium and beat until the outside of the bowl is cool to the touch, 10 to 15 minutes. With the mixer running, add the butter a couple of pieces at a time, waiting for each addition to incorporate into the pudding before adding the next, until you have a smooth, glossy, spreadable frosting. Stop the mixer, thoroughly scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, and add the vanilla. Beat once more just until evenly mixed., Unmold and level the cakes: Use a butter knife or small offset spatula to cut around the cooled cakes, pressing the blade firmly against the sides of the pans to loosen them. Invert the cakes onto a wire rack, remove the parchment paper if necessary, then invert again onto a second rack or cutting board so they’re domed side up. Holding a serrated knife parallel to the work surface, slice horizontally through the surface of each cake to level the layers. (The scraps are perfect for snacking.), Place one of the layers cut side-down on a serving plate, cake stand or cardboard cake round. Dollop about 1 cup buttercream in the center, then use an offset spatula to spread it evenly all the way to the edges. Place a second layer cut side-down over the first, center it, then top with another 1 cup of buttercream. Place the third layer on top, cut side-down, pressing gently to level it. Scrape about half of the remaining buttercream over the top of the cake, then use the spatula to spread it across the surface and down the sides, covering the entire cake in a very thin layer of frosting. (The cake will show through in several places; this is just the crumb coat.) Transfer the cake to the refrigerator and chill just until the frosting is firm, 10 to 15 minutes, then cover with the remaining frosting., The assembled cake will keep, loosely covered at room temperature, for 1 day. (Before covering the cake, chill it for 15 minutes so the frosting can firm up.) After 24 hours, refrigerate the cake and be sure to tightly cover any cut surfaces.

Then, whip until the mixture falls off the whisk in a thick ribbon that doesn't disappear for 1-2 seconds (~20 min; or more if using a hand mixer)., Prep: Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350F with the rack centered. Line an 8-inch round cake pan (at least 2"" tall) lined with foil or parchment and spray with nonstick spray. Alternatively, you can brush room temperature butter on the inside of the pan, then dust it with flour, knocking out the excess to make the surface non-stick. You can also bake this cake in two separate 8-inch round cake pans; this way, you wouldn't have to cut the cake into two horizontally after baking., Optional: Fasten the wet baking strips around the baking pan for an evenly risen cake (optional). The baking strips ensure that the cake rises evenly and doesn't form a dome., Sift dry ingredients: Sift 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 tsp baking powder, twice., Mix liquids: In a cup whisk together 2 TBSP melted butter, 1 TBSP hot water and 1 tsp of vanilla extract., Fold in dry ingredients: add the dry ingredients into the whipped eggs in halves, carefully folding with a spatula, forming the number 8 with each stroke. Do not overfold, or the cake will be dense and doughy. Just fold enough to incorporate the flour barely., Next, Fold in the liquids and carefully keep folding the batter until thoroughly incorporated. Do not overmix or the cake will be dense., Bake: Pour the sponge cake batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake for about 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Do not open the oven to check until you can smell cake in the kitchen (~30 min). If baking in 2 instead of 1 baking pan, reduce the baking time to 20-25 minutes, or until a toothcpick comes out clean., Remove the sponge cake to a cooling rack and allow to sit undisturbed for 5 minutes. Then invert it onto a cooling rack and remove the foil or parchment. Allow to completely cool before using., Let rest: For best results wrap the cooled cake in plastic and leave on the counter for 6-8 hours before using in a cake. This will reduce the amount of crumbling when you split the cake layer in two horizontally., How to split the cake in two horizontally: place the palm of your non-dominant hand over the top of the cake and keep rotating it as you use your dominant hand to hold a long serrated knife, and start scoring the outside of the cake, about 1/2 inch deep, going all around the cake. Continue going in circles scoring deeper and deeper until you get to the center. The easiest method: attach these two cake leveler pieces on two opposing ends of the knife blade, then just cut the cake horizontally by moving the knife back and forth in a back-and-forth motion while keeping the knife perpendicular to the surface. The levelers will ensure that the blade stays level throughout the cutting.","[('eggs', 4.0, 'large'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('flour', 1.0, 'cup'), ('baking powder', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('butter', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('water', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'tsp')]"

Once completely cooled, just cover with plastic wrap and store at room temperature., 2 cups White Sugar, 8 Tablespoons Salted Butter, Softened, Cut Into Tablespoon Sized Pieces, 1 cup Heavy Cream, 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon Himalayan Salt (or table salt), to taste, 4 large egg whites, room temperature, 1 cup white sugar, 1 lb butter, cut into 1"" chunks, room temperature, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 cup of caramel sauce, room temperature","Add the sugar to a large pot set over medium-high heat. Gently stir until the sugar has melted, then stop stirring., Let it boil, without touching, until the caramel reaches an amber colour, and registers 320ºF on a candy or instant read thermometer. It will have a nice amber colour, but should not smell burnt at all., As soon as it reaches 320ºF remove from the heat and whisk in the butter until completely melted and combined., Slowly pour in the heavy cream, in a thin stream, while whisking vigorously. Stir in the salt, and pour into a Pyrex glass measuring cup to cool completely before using., This can be made ahead and stored in the fridge. If you do this, simply return it to room temperature before using for in the buttercream and spreading on the cake layers., Put about 2"" of water into the a medium sauce pan and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat., Put the egg whites and sugar into a large heatproof bowl (I use a metal one), and set it over the boiling water. The bowl will become very hot so use an oven mitt to hold onto it. Whisk until hot to the touch, and the sugar has completely dissolved. I test it by rubbing a drop between my fingers, or checking the temperature with an instant read thermometer (you want it to reach 140ºF)., Immediately pour the mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer (you can do it with a hand mixer, but it's easier with a stand mixer). Leave the mixer running on medium-high speed for 8 minutes. The sides of the bowl need to be cool to the touch so that the butter doesn't melt, and the mixture will have doubled in volume and be nice and glossy looking., Turn the mixer down to medium speed, and add the butter two pieces at a time. Once all the butter has been added, continue to mix on medium-high for two minutes, until it's light and fluffy., Scrap down the sides of the bowl, and add the vanilla and caramel sauce. Beat for 2 more minutes., Use the buttercream right away, or store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week. Bring to room temperature before trying to use., Place one layer of the vanilla sponge cake onto a plate, cut (from levelling off the top) side up. Spread 1/4 cup of salted caramel sauce over the top, and then top with a 1/4"" layer of buttercream. Repeat. Place the last cake layer on top, with the cut side down., Spread a very thin layer of buttercream over the top and sides of the cake (so thin you can see through it). This is called the crumb layer, and it's just to make sure that no crumbs get into the pretty icing on the outside. Put the cake into the fridge for 30 minutes, just to make the crumb layer firm up., Spread the rest of your buttercream on the top and sides of the cake., If you want to have some of the caramel sauce on the top and running down the sides, put the fully frosted cake back into the fridge for another 30 minutes. Spread a thin layer of caramel sauce over the top, then you can create that pretty drip effect by spreading the caramel to the edges using an offset spatula., Keep the finished cake in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. It's best to let it come up to room temperature before serving it.","[('white sugar', 2.0, 'cups'), ('salted butter', 8.0, 'tablespoons'), ('heavy cream', 1.0, 'cup'), ('himalayan salt', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('egg whites', 4.0, None), ('butter', 1.0, 'lb'), ('vanilla', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('caramel sauce', 0.25, 'cup')]"

This may vary slightly depending on pan type. Cool completely in pan., Over low heat in a light-colored sauce pan (so you can visualize the color change), melt butter., Stirring occasionally, heat butter over low to medium-low heat until bubbles start to form., As bubbles form, stir more often. The butter will start to bubble more vigorously., You may want to place a splatter guard over the pan., At around 212 F (you don't need to check this), the butter will be at a full bubble.

As foam forms, carefully strain it off with a spoon., Stir the de-foamed butter continuously until the small bits in the bottom of the pan turn amber brown. The butter itself may NOT turn very brown. These bits are the milk fats. Look for the color change there. Be very careful to not burn the milk fat solids., Once browned, pour into a new bowl and allow to cool completely in fridge.

Pour into an ungreased 9×2 inch pie dish or round cake pan. (Make sure the pan is 2 inches deep. I recommend this pie dish, which is 1.8 inches deep but I never have an overflow issue.) Arrange the apple slices neatly on top, overlapping where necessary. See photo above. Place pan in the refrigerator for a few minutes as you prepare the cake batter. This helps solidify or “set” the topping’s arrangement., Make the cake batter:, Whisk the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together. Set aside., Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add both sugars and beat on high speed until creamed together, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. On high speed, beat in the eggs and vanilla extract until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer onto low speed and as the mixer runs, slowly pour in the milk. Beat on low speed just until all of the ingredients are combined. Do not over-mix. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick., Remove topping from the refrigerator. Pour and spread cake batter evenly over topping., Bake for 40–46 minutes, tenting foil on top of the cake halfway through bake time to prevent the top from over-browning before the center has a chance to fully cook.

Don’t be alarmed if your cake takes longer or if the cake rises up and sticks to the foil. (We serve the cake upside down anyway!), Remove cake from the oven and cool on a wire rack for just 15 minutes. Invert the slightly cooled cake onto a cake stand or serving plate. Some of the juices from the topping will seep over the sides—that’s ok. You can slice and serve the cake warm, but the slices will be messy. I find it’s best to cool the cake completely at room temperature before slicing and serving. Do not refrigerate the cake to speed up the cooling process because it could end up tasting overly dense., Cover leftover slices and store for up to 3 days in the refrigerator or 3 months in the freezer.

Lightly grease three 8-inch anodized aluminum cake pans and line with parchment (explanation and tutorial here ). If you don’t have 3 pans, it’s okay to bake the cakes in stages, the batter will keep at room temperature until needed., In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine sugar, baking powder, salt, and butter. Mix on low speed to roughly incorporate, then increase to medium and beat until fluffy and light, about 5 minutes. About halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula., With the mixer still running, add the eggs one at a time, letting each fully incorporate before adding the next, then dribble in the vanilla. Reduce speed to low and sprinkle in about 1/3 of the flour, then drizzle in 1/3 of the milk. Repeat with remaining flour and milk, working in thirds as before., Scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula, and resume mixing on medium speed for about 3 seconds to ensure everything is well combined. The batter should look creamy and thick, registering between 65 and 68°F (18 and 20°C) on a digital thermometer. (Significant deviation indicates ingredients were too warm or too cold, which can lead to textural problems with the cake.), Fold batter once or twice from the bottom up with a flexible spatula, then divide evenly between prepared cake pans (about 20 ounces or 565g if you have a scale). Stagger pans together on the oven rack, and bake until puffed, firm, and pale gold, about 32 minutes. If your oven has very uneven heat, pause to rotate the pans after about 20 minutes. Alternatively, bake 2 layers at once and finish the third when they’re done., Cool cakes directly in their pans for 1 hour, then run a butter knife around the edges to loosen. Invert onto a wire rack, peel off the parchment, and return cakes right-side-up (covered in plastic, the cakes can be left at room temperature for a few hours). Prepare the buttercream., For the Crumb Coat: Level cakes with a serrated knife (full directions here ) and set the scraps aside for snacking. Place one layer on a heavy cast iron turntable. If you like, a waxed cardboard cake round can first be placed underneath, secured to the turntable with a scrap of damp paper towel. Top with exactly 1 cup buttercream, using an offset spatula to spread it evenly from edge to edge. Repeat with the second and third layers, then cover the sides of the cake with another cup of buttercream, spreading it as smoothly as you can (tutorial here ). Refrigerate cake until the buttercream hardens, about 30 minutes., To Finish: Rewhip remaining buttercream to restore its creamy consistency, then use to finish and decorate the chilled cake as desired.

Line 1/4 Sheet pan with parchment paper, and then spray bottom (on top of the parchment) and sides of the sheet pan with cooking spray., Sift Dry Ingredients in a bowl and then whisk until well blended., Combine and stir Wet Ingredients in a separate bowl or pitcher., With a stand mixer (preferred) or handheld mixer, cream sugar and salted butter together until creamy and fluffy. Add oil and corn syrup and beat until incorporated. Add 1 egg(s) and cream until well blended, scraping sides of the bowl as needed., On low speed, alternate adding Dry ingredients and Wet ingredients to the Creamed Ingredients, a little at a time. I do 1/3 Dry, 1/3 Wet, and so on, adding one-third at a time and blending on low after each addition. Continue to mix just until the batter looks well blended and smooth (avoid overbeating). Scrape sides of the bowl as needed., Using a whip attachment and a clean bowl, whip the 2 egg whites and cream of tartar until stiff peaks form. (Make sure your bowl and beaters are clean and free from grease so that the whites will whip)., Carefully fold the Whipped Whites into the cake batter, one half of the whites at a time. The batter is ready when no egg white streaks remain and it should look smooth and uniform., Spread into prepared pan and make sure the batter is evenly distributed. An offset spatula works well for this., Bake on the middle or top rack (avoid bottom rack) of preheated 325-degree oven for 18 minutes, then turn the oven down to 300 degrees. Set the timer for an additional 6-8 minutes. Check the cake at this point. If it is jiggly at all when lightly touching the top of the cake, continue baking for 1-6 more minutes. The cake is done when a paring knife or toothpick comes out mostly clean when stuck quickly in the cake. A couple moist crumbs on your knife are fine, but they shouldn't look wet. Allow to cool completely., Either follow the Baker's Shortcut (Note #4) or choose your round cake size using the Cut and Stack method (Note #2). Leave the cake in the sheet pan, and using a slight sawing motion, cut the cooled cake into your desired cake size with cake rings (You can use a knife and the cake rings as a guide for any halve pieces that you cut.) Brush lightly with simple syrup (optional, Note #3)., Wrap thoroughly in plastic wrap and freeze cake in the pan for 2 hours or overnight. (You can even bake the cake up to a week ahead of time and freeze). The cake will be much easier to layer if it is cold or frozen. To wrap the cake, place another sheet of parchment on top of the cake (this will prevent the plastic wrap from sticking to the cake), and wrap the whole pan with plastic wrap. (I pull the plastic wrap out and place the pan on top of it. Then I wrap 2-3 ways horizontally and one way vertically so that there are two layers of wrap on all sides of the pan including the bottom)., Make Vanilla Buttercream, Whisk the powdered sugar and Instant Clearjel (if using) together until well-blended. Set aside., Using a stand mixer (preferred) or handheld mixer and a large bowl, beat the cream cheese until broken up and softened., Add the room temperature salted butter and continue to beat, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed., Add the shortening and beat and scrape the sides until there are no lumps., While the mixer is on low, slowly add the powdered sugar mixture., Add the pure vanilla and almond extract. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Then beat the buttercream on high for two-three minutes. This will add air into the buttercream and make it light and fluffy. The Instant Clearjel will cause the buttercream to thicken slightly during the next 10 minutes as it sits., Make White Ganache (optional), Combine all ganache ingredients and heat in the microwave at 50% power for 20-30 second increments. Whisk for 30 seconds to one minute in between each heat. (It should only take two to three heats in the microwave. Lots of whisking will melt your white chocolate and candy melts faster and prevent them from overcooking in the microwave)., Frost the Cake, The easiest way to layer the cake is to layer the cake from frozen the day before you plan to serve it. If serving the cake the same day you are layering it, use refrigerated cake layers instead of frozen. Piece together the bottom layer, filling in with cake scraps if needed. You can use the cake ring as a guide., Fill the three cake layers with around 1/4 inch of buttercream. I recommend frosting a thin crumb coat of buttercream on the outside of the cake which will catch all the crumby edges, then allow it to set up in the freezer for about 10 minutes until the buttercream is firm. An offset icing spatula (I use the small and medium-size on all my cakes) helps with this. Then spread on the second layer of buttercream and decorate as desired., If using, microwave the reserved ganache on 50% power until thin, and drizzle down the sides of the cake using a spoon or squeeze bottle. There is enough buttercream to frost an extra-tall row of rosettes around the top of the cake using a pastry bag and 1M star tip (or get creative with a different design!)., You can let the cake set up in the fridge, but remove it from the fridge 1-3 hours before serving so it can come back to room temperature. This cake has the best texture at room temperature.

Also, prepare the baking pans. This recipe is perfect for two, 8-inch cake pans or a jelly roll pan, if you're making a cake roll. You can also make cupcakes using this recipe. It's very important to leave the pans ungreased!! Line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper but do not grease the sides, otherwise the cake will not rise properly., Clean your stand mixer bowl using a degreasing soap or vinegar to get rid of any grease residue. Place the eggs, sugar and vanilla into the bowl and whisk on high speed for 7 to 9 minutes, until the eggs are thick, pale and voluminous. Watch my video recipe for all the details! If using a hand mixer, this step may take an additional 5 to 7 minutes, depending on mixer strength., In a separate bowl, combine the dry ingredients: flour and baking powder. Once the eggs are ready, sift the dry ingredients into the eggs in small increments or one-third at a time. Using a spatula (do not use a whisk or the mixer for this step!), fold the flour gently but thoroughly into the eggs, mixing from the bottom of the mixing bowl. Keep the eggs as light and fluffy as possible!, Divide the cake batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 22 minutes, or until the top of the cake turns a rich, golden-brown color. Immediately after removing the cake from the oven, run a knife along the edge of the pan to release the cake. This will allow it stay level as it cools. Allow the cake to cool completely before splitting/cutting the cake or using for a cake recipe., Need to increase this recipe? For more cake layers or if using large cake pans, increase the recipe in 1/2 increments. For example, if using this recipe for three, 8-inch cake pans or two, 9-inch pans, use 9 eggs, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1 1/2 cups flour and 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder. Keep the baking temperature the same and adjust the baking time as needed. The top of the cake should be a rich, golden-brown color when ready.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 27-30 minutes or until a toothpick tester comes out clean. Let the cake cool slightly in the pan for a few minutes then remove the springform collar. Peel away the parchment and let cool completely on a wire rack., Optional: The baked genoise will be lightweight and the exterior dry and firm. When it's completely cool, wrap the cake in plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator overnight to soften the cake's exterior. This will make it easier to cut. The cake can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days., Make the custard filling: Stir together the milk, egg yolks, cornstarch, and sugar in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens. The minute the mixture starts to thicken, remove it from the heat source and whisk vigorously. Stir in the vanilla. Transfer to a bowl and let cool slightly. Press plastic wrap over the surface of the custard and refrigerate until firm. The chilled custard should be thick and hold in the bowl of a spoon., Make the stabilized whipped cream: Sprinkle the gelatin over the 2 tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Let stand until set. Place the heavy cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whip attachment. Set mixer speed to medium and beat until soft peaks form. Gradually add in the powdered sugar and then mix in the vanilla. Heat gelatin in the microwave for 5-7 seconds, or until completely liquid. Gradually add liquid gelatin to whipped cream in a thin stream with the mixer running. After all of the gelatin is added, increase mixer speed to high and beat to stiff peaks. Remove 1/2 cup of the whipped cream and set aside., Build the layers: Torte the cake into three layers using a serrated knife. The layers will be very thin so do this carefully. Place the bottom cake layer on a plate or cake board. Spread on the raspberry jam. Top with 1/2 of the custard filling. Top with a second cake layer. Spread over the remaining 1/2 of custard. Pile all of the whipped cream on top and smooth into a dome shape using a large spatula. Place the final cake layer on top and press down so that all of the cake’s edges are smoothed against the whipped cream and a dome shape is formed. Cover with the reserved 1/2 cup of stabilized whipped cream., Prep and cover with marzipan: Dust a work surface with powdered sugar. Knead the marzipan with your hands to soften and place it on the work surface. Add a small amount of leaf green food color to the marzipan and knead in until a consistent green color is achieved. Lightly add powdered sugar as needed to prevent sticking. Roll it to a large circle, lifting to occasionally dust underneath with powdered sugar to prevent sticking. Gently lay the marzipan circle over the top of the cake and use your hands to form the marzipan to the shape of the cake. Trim the excess marzipan from the bottom of the cake using a pizza or pastry wheel. Gently tuck the bottom edges of the marzipan under the cake using the back of a butter knife., Decors: Paint the white Wilton candy roses with a little Baker’s Rose food color dissolved in clear extract. Use a kitchen-dedicated art brush with soft bristles so the food color can easily be brushed between the petals., Tint leftover marzipan with a little more leaf green food color, and roll flat on a powdered sugar-dusted work surface. Cut small star-shaped flowers from the marzipan using a fondant cutter. Use leftover buttercream or a dot of corn syrup to attach the star shape to the bottom of the candy rose., Attach the rose to the top center of the cake using buttercream or a dot of corn syrup. Dust the top of the cake with powdered sugar using a small sieve., The cake needs to be refrigerated at least one hour, or overnight is best. Keep chilled until serving time and any leftovers need to be refrigerated as well.","['eggs', 4.0, 'large'], ['sugar', 1.0, 'cup'], ['flour', 0.5, 'cup'], ['cornstarch', 0.5, 'cup'], ['baking powder', 1.0, 'teaspoon'], ['salt', 0.125, 'teaspoon'], ['milk', 1.0, 'cup'], ['egg yolks', 4.0, None], ['corn starch', 2.0, 'tablespoons'], ['granulated sugar', 0.25, 'cup'], ['vanilla extract', 1.0, 'teaspoon'], ['powdered unflavored gelatin', 0.25, 'ounce'], ['cold water', 2.0, 'tablespoons'], ['heavy cream', 2.0, 'cups'], ['powdered sugar', 0.25, 'cup'], ['vanilla extract', 1.0, 'teaspoon'], ['raspberry jam', 0.33, 'cup'], ['marzipan', 1.0, 'pound'], ['food color', 1.0, 'drop'], ['extract', 1.0, 'drop']"

If you want to go the long way around, just mix the flour, sugar and leavening agents in a large bowl and beat in the soft butter until you have a combined and creamy mixture. Now whisk together the cocoa, sour cream, vanilla and eggs and beat this into your bowl of mixture., Divide this batter, using a rubber spatula to help you scrape and spread, into the prepared tins and bake until a cake tester, or a thin skewer, comes out clean, which should be about 35 minutes, but it is wise to start checking at 25. Also, it might make sense to switch the two cakes around in the oven halfway through cooking time., Remove the cakes, in their tins, to a wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes before turning out of their tins. Don't worry about any cracks as they will easily be covered by the icing later., To make this icing, melt the butter and chocolate in a good-sized bowl either in the microwave or suspended over a pan of simmering water. Go slowly either way: you don't want any burning or seizing., While the chocolate and butter are cooling a little, sieve the icing sugar into another bowl. Or, easier still, put the icing sugar into the food processor and blitz. This is by far and away the least tedious way of removing lumps., Add the golden syrup to the cooled chocolate mixture, followed by the sour cream and vanilla and then when all this is combined whisk in the sieved icing sugar. Or just pour this mixture down the funnel of the food processor on to the icing sugar, with the motor running., When you've done, you may need to add a little boiling water — say a teaspoon or so — or indeed some more icing sugar: it depends on whether you need the icing to be runnier or thicker; or indeed it may be right as it is. It should be liquid enough to coat easily, but thick enough not to drip off., Choose your cake stand or plate and cut out four strips of baking parchment to form a square outline on it (this stops the icing running on to the plate). Then sit one of the cakes, uppermost (ie slightly domed) side down., Spoon about a third of the icing on to the centre of the cake half and spread with a knife or spatula until you cover the top of it evenly. Sit the other cake on top, normal way up, pressing gently to sandwich the two together., Spoon another third of the icing on to the top of the cake and spread it in a swirly, textured way (though you can go for a smooth finish if you prefer, and have the patience). Spread the sides of the cake with the remaining icing and leave a few minutes till set, then carefully pull away the paper strips., I love to dot the top of this with sugar pansies — and you must admit, they do look enchanting — but there really is no need to make a shopping expedition out of it.

To do this, simply add the rum to the saucepan after the thread stage is reached and cook for another minute., Make the baba dough- first rise, To make the babà dough: Mix milk, yeast and ½ cup of the flour until it forms a soft ball of dough.

Once a uniform dough is formed, turn out onto a floured board. Knead for 5 minutes until smooth. The kneading is important because you want to develop the gluten. If the dough gets too sticky, dust the board with a bit of flour, little by little as needed., Prepare baba molds, To prepare the babà molds: Spread a thin layer of butter around the inside and bottom of each mold and then dust with flour. You'll need a large cookie sheet to place the molds on when they go into the oven., Filling the baba molds, This dough recipe will fill twelve 3-oz babà molds. If using a scale, put 1.5 oz of dough in each prepared mold or simply fill halfway., Cover the molds with a kitchen towel and let it rise until doubled or until the dough reaches the top of the mold. It will take about 2 hours., Preheat oven to 350° F. Place the molds on a large cookie sheet, making sure there is at least 2 inches between each mold.

Serve right away. Add a spoonful of fruit jam, whipped cream or a dab of Mascarpone cheese.

Line three 6-inch round cake pans with parchment paper and spray with nonstick cooking spray., In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, crushed cereal, and both sugars until well combined. Add the oil, yogurt, and 3/4 cup cereal milk and continue stirring with a whisk.

It should be just a little longer than it is wide. Fold the foil in half lengthwise, then fold it in half again to create a rectangle that’s about 6 inches long and 7 inches wide. Repeat to make a dozen rectangles., Shape, Place 1 sheet of folded foil on your work surface, with the long side facing you. Place a standard-size plastic or glass spice jar on its side in the center of the foil, the jar’s long side also facing you. Bring the long sides of the foil up around the jar. The foil won’t reach all the way around, and that’s okay. Fold the foil in around both top and bottom ends of the spice jar, nice and tight. You’ll end up with a sort of trough situation. (Cookbook author Todd Wilbur has a video of the process here; if you’re impatient, fast forward to 1:10, where the action starts.) Repeat until you have 12 foil Twinkie molds. Spritz the molds with an obscenely generous amount of nonstick spray or use your fingertips to coat the molds with vegetable oil. Place the Twinkie molds on a baking sheet or in a roasting pan., Whisk the flours, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl., Heat, In a small saucepan over low heat, heat the milk and butter until the butter melts. Remove from the heat add the vanilla. Cover to keep warm., Separate the eggs, placing the whites in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or, if using a hand mixer or whisk, a large mixing bowl) and reserving the yolks in another bowl. Beat the whites on high speed until foamy. Gradually add 6 tablespoons of the sugar and the cream of tartar and continue to beat until the whites reach soft, moist peaks., Beat, Dump the beaten egg whites into a large bowl and add the egg yolks to the standing mixer bowl—there’s no need to clean the bowl (or, if using a hand mixer or whisk, simply place the egg yolks in a separate large bowl). Beat the egg yolks with the remaining 6 tablespoons sugar on medium-high speed until the mixture is very thick and a pale lemon color, about 5 minutes. Add the beaten egg whites to the yolks, but do not mix., Fold, Sprinkle the flour mixture over the egg whites and then mix everything on low speed for just 10 seconds (or, if using a hand mixer or whisk, until blended but not thoroughly combined). Remove the bowl from the mixer, make a well in one side of the batter, and pour the melted butter mixture into the bowl. Fold gently with a large rubber spatula until the batter shows no trace of flour and the whites and yolks are evenly mixed, about 8 strokes., Bake, Immediately scrape the batter into the prepared molds, filling each with about 3/4 inch batter. Bake until the cake tops are light brown and feel firm and spring back when touched, 13 to 15 minutes. Transfer the pan containing the molds to a wire rack and allow the cakes to cool in the molds., Poke, Just before filling, remove each cake from the foil. Using the end of a chopstick, poke three holes in the bottom of each cake, just like in the bottom of real Twinkies. Wiggle the tip of the chopstick around quite a lot to make room for the filling. (Again, you can see this in action, beginning at minute 3.), Fill, Scoop frosting into a pastry bag fit with a small tip about 1/4 inch across. Pipe the frosting into the holes you created in the bottom of the cakes. As you fill each cake, hold it in your palm and gently exert pressure on it so you can feel the cake expand, taking care not to overfill the cake, which would make it crack., Serve, Unlike real Twinkies, these won’t last indefinitely.

Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel, cloth bowl cover, or plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator immediately for at least 12 hours or for as long as three days. (See notes above if you need to skip the overnight rise for time purposes.) NOTE: It is important the dough really be slicked with olive oil especially if you are using a cloth bowl cover or tea towel as opposed to plastic wrap or a hard lid. If you are using a tea towel, consider securing it with a rubber band to make a more airtight cover. If you do not slick the dough with enough oil, you risk the dough drying out and forming a crust over the top layer., Line two 8- or 9-inch pie plates or a 9×13-inch pan (see notes above) with parchment paper or grease with butter or coat with nonstick cooking spray.

With my USA pans, I can get away with olive oil alone; with my glass baking dishes, butter is a must.), Pour a tablespoon of oil into the center of each pan or 2 tablespoons of oil if using the 9×13-inch pan. Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center. Rotate the bowl in quarter turns as you deflate, turning the mass into a rough ball. Use the forks to split the dough into two equal pieces (or do not split if using the 9×13-inch pan). Place one piece into one of the prepared pans. Roll the dough ball in the oil to coat it all over, forming a rough ball. Repeat with the remaining piece.

I made a fondant icing rainbow (tutorial linked above) and letters, some pink buttercream (extracted from the main batch of buttercream) and added sprinkles to mine.","Preheat the oven to 180C (fan). Grease two 20cm/8 inch non-stick cake pans with a little butter and line the bases with non-stick baking paper (if you have more than two tins then feel free to use more, I simply use two tins on rotation to make all six sponges)., Cream the Stork/butter and sugar together using an electric hand whisk or stand mixer (or wooden spoon), for a couple of minutes until pale and smooth., Add the vanilla and then the eggs one at a time, working them into the mixture after each addition. If the batter looks like it has split, don't worry, once the flours have been added it'll revert to a nice smooth batter., Sift the flour, xanthan gum and baking powder into the bowl and tip in the ground almonds.

Scoop approx 250-270g cake batter into a small bowl and add a couple of drops of food colouring. Stir and keep adding until you are happy with the colour. I find the colours develop during baking, so err on the lighter side if you want pastel sponges., Repeat this process with a second different colour., Pour each coloured batter into a prepared cake tin. Use a small angled palette knife to spread the batter to the edges of the tin and smooth the top so they are fairly level., Transfer the tins to the oven on the middle shelf and bake for approximately 12-14 minutes, until your cake tester comes out clean from the centre of the cakes., While they are baking, you can repeat step 5 and prepare two more coloured batters., Once the cakes are baking, ease a palette knife gently round the edge of the tin to loosen the edges, then carefully flip the cakes out on a wire rack to cool. Peel off the baking paper if it is still attached to the cake. Set the cakes aside to cool fully. Then onto the next sponges!, If reusing the tins, give them a quick cool and wipe under a cold tap (ensure any crumbs are removed). Then regrease, add fresh circles of baking paper and add the two new coloured cake batters. Bake as before., Repeat the process for the final two layers, and you will end up with six lovely rainbow sponges. Leave to cool fully, then wrap each in cling film and place into an airtight tin until needed., A stand mixer is ideal for this, but an electric whisk is also okay. Add the butter to a bowl and beat for a 5 minutes until it has turned from yellow to a paler, almost white colour., Add the sifted icing sugar and vanilla bean paste to the bowl. Mix well until smooth and creamy., If needed, add the milk to softened the consistency and beat again. This will make it easier to spread., Take your cake board and place a small dollop on icing in the centre, to help anchor the base sponge. Decide on the order of your sponges and place the first sponge on the board., Smooth a layer of buttercream on top of the sponge, then place the second sponge on top. Repeat until you have a stack of six sponges., I like to crumb coat the cake before adding the final icing. This helps to ensure you don't have any loose crumbs or bits of cake on the outside of the icing. To do this, spread a thin layer of icing all over the cake, top and sides with a palette knife., If you have a turntable and cake scraper, these are handy tools to use now, but don't fret it not, simply turn your board manually and use something with a long flat edge (such as the palette knife). Hold your cake scrape so it is just touching the edge of the sponge and rotate the turntable, scraping off the excess icing as you go. You're not looking to remove all the buttercream, you are simply giving it a nice even coating., Do the same with the top of the cake, to create a nice flat surface. Then pop the cake into the fridge to chill for at least 30 minutes., Once chilled, you can ice and decorate the cake, hooray the fun bit! Slather the cake with that lovely buttercream, or pipe if you prefer, to create your desired finish.

Preheat the oven to 350F/175C, with a rack in the middle. Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans. *see note about cake pans below, Make the cakes: Sift the cake flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl.

Transfer the mixture into the lined springform pan and, using the flat bottom of a glass or measuring cup, compress them into an even layer with an approximately 1 ½ inch (4cm) rim around the edge.Tip: Depending on the type and brand of cookies/biscuits you use, you might need slightly less or slightly more butter than listed in this recipe. Add the butter slowly, mixing well after each addition, until you reach the consistency of wet sand. You want a mixture that sticks together or holds its shape when pressed together, but it shouldn't feel/look greasy or oily., Bake at 350ºF (180ºC) for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and allow to cool until warm., For strawberry cheesecake filling:, Reduce the oven temperature to 285ºF (140ºC).Tip: If your springform pan isn't 100% leak-proof, I recommend that you also get a baking sheet ready to place the cheesecake on it before it goes into the oven. This will catch any small leaks of butter from the cheesecake base, and prevent any smoking or burning at the bottom of your oven., First, prepare the ""strawberry sugar"": in a food processor or blender, combine the freeze dried strawberry slices and sugar, and process them until you get a fine powder., In a large bowl using a balloon whisk, mix the cream cheese and yoghurt together until smooth. Tip: Make sure to MIX rather than whisk or aerate – you don't want to incorporate too much air into the mixture. If you don't want to do this by hand, use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on the lowest speed setting. (I don't recommend using a hand mixer.), Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition, until smooth., Add the vanilla bean paste and mix well until evenly incorporated., Add the ""strawberry sugar"" and the cornstarch, and mix well until completely incorporated and no clumps remain. The final cheesecake filling will be velvety-smooth, super creamy and of a light pink colour. At this stage you can also correct the colour by adding a drop or two of red food colouring.Tip: I like to a bit of red food colouring to the strawberry cheesecake filling, just as a fail-safe to ensure a lovely, vibrant pink filling after the cheesecake is baked. That’s because strawberries (be that in the form of pureed fresh strawberries or in the form of ground freeze dried strawberries) tend to oxidise and lose their colour on contact with dairy products, such as milk or cream cheese. This doesn’t affect the flavour, but if you want your cheesecake filling to be a nice pink colour, I definitely recommend adding a bit of red food colouring., Transfer the strawberry cheesecake filling into the slightly cooled cheesecake crust and smooth out the top., Bake at 285ºF (140ºC) for about 55 minutes, or until the edges are fully set and slightly puffed up, and the middle is still wobbly when you gently shake the baking pan.Tip: This baking time is merely a guideline – you should always judge the doneness of a cheesecake based on its physical indicators (the wobbliness of the centre, how set the edges are, etc.) rather than on the baking time, especially as each oven behaves slightly differently. You should start checking your cheesecake about 10 minutes before the recommended baking time., Turn off the oven and allow the cheesecake to cool to room temperature in the turned-off oven with the oven door ajar., Once cooled to room temperature, transfer the cheesecake into the fridge for at least 4 hours (or preferably overnight) before removing it from the baking pan. Keep it in the fridge until you're ready to assemble/decorate., For strawberry topping:, In a large bowl, combine the halved and quartered strawberries, sugar, lemon juice and vanilla. Mix well until the strawberries are evenly coated with the sugar., Cover and allow to sit either at room temperature for 1-2 hours or in the fridge overnight, stirring occasionally., Once the strawberries have released their juices, pass them through a sieve to drain the juices, then return the strawberries back into the bowl and set aside until needed., Pour the juices into a saucepan and cook over medium-high heat with frequent stirring until thickened and syrupy, but not quite jam-like. This should take about 5 minutes. Once thickened, set aside to cool until warm.Tip: I always like to err on the side of over-reducing (rather than under-reducing) the juices, as it’s easy to dilute them to the right consistency with a splash of water or lemon juice., Mix the warm strawberry syrup with the strawberries to make the strawberry topping and set aside until needed., Assembling the strawberry cheesecake:, Once the cheesecake is fully chilled, remove it out of the springform pan and onto a serving plate., Just before serving, spoon the topping onto the cheesecake so that it’s covered in a single layer of strawberries.Tip: The topping does make cutting the cheesecake slightly messy – so, what you could do is cut the cheesecake without the topping and them spoon it over the individual slices right before serving., Storage:, The strawberry cheesecake keeps well in a closed container in the fridge for 4-5 days.","[('digestive biscuits', 225, 'g'), ('butter', 75, 'g'), ('strawberry slices', 50, 'g'), ('sugar', 200, 'g'), ('cream cheese', 600, 'g'), ('yoghurt', 115, 'g'), ('eggs', 3, None), ('vanilla bean paste', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('cornflour', 20, 'g'), ('food colouring', None, None), ('strawberries', 320, 'g'), ('sugar', 50, 'g'), ('lemon juice', 1, 'tbsp'), ('vanilla bean paste', 0.5, 'tsp')]"

Place the egg yolks in a bowl, and the egg whites in a mixer bowl., Place the butter, cream cheese and 1/4 cup of fine sugar into a pot over low-heat. Allow the ingredients to melt, and mix together into a beautifully smooth batter mixture., Remove the pot from heat, and add the egg yolks into the batter mixture. Mix well, but gently., Add the cornstarch and flour. Once again, mix well. Clumps should disappear., Add milk and optionally vanilla extract or other flavors of your choice., Mix well. The batter should be smooth and liquid-y. You won’t have to strain this mixture. (See video), Set aside the batter as you beat the egg whites into stiff peaks (see below for egg beating tips.), Pre-heat oven to 330F. Prepare a bain-marie by putting water in a deep rectangular baking pan or dish. Place into the oven., Prepare baking pans— with these ingredients, you can bake one 8-inch cake or two 6-inch cakes.

Pour the batter into the rest of the egg whites and mix together using folding techniques. You don’t want to over-mix or under mix. If you over-mix, the cake will not rise. If you under-mix, your cake will be uneven. The egg white will float to the top and you’ll have a meringue-like cake at the top, and a dense cheesecake at the bottom., Pour the well-incorporated, but not over-mixed batter into the baking pan(s)., Bake bain-marie style for 25 minutes 330F (Depending on your oven, you may have to adjust the temperature.) If your cake is not rising, your oven temperature is too low. Raise by 10 degrees., After 25 minutes, your cake should rise. If it has not risen yet, allow it to stay at the same temperature and give it time to rise (or you may have to raise the temperature). Once it rises nicely, crack open the oven door slightly and keep it open for 10 seconds (approximately). Lower the oven temperature to about 245-265F, depending on your oven, and bake for an additional 45 minutes. At this point, there is a possibility your cake may crack if the oven temperature is too high., Allow your cake to rest in the oven after baking for about 10 minutes., Remove from the oven. Be careful and use oven mitts as needed., Place a sheet of parchment paper over the cake. Place a plate over the cake and parchment paper. Flip the cake upside down so the top of it is now the bottom while resting on the parchment paper over the plate. Remove the cake from the pan by sliding it out, or gently shaking it out., Remove the wet parchment paper from the cake, replace the bottom parchment paper of the cake., Now place another plate— the presentation or serving plate, on top of the cake. It should be on top of the bottom of the cake. Flip the cake again, carefully., Play with the bouncy jiggly-ness of the cake. Serve when still warm, or chill in the fridge.

You’ll need margarine or butter, sugar and flour in the same weights as the duck eggs to get a perfect cake every time!, In a large bowl and using an electric hand whisk whizz together the margarine or butter, and the sugar until light, fluffy and pale., Beat in the eggs one by one, along with the vanilla extract. If you’re using duck eggs from a farm rather than a supermarket, crack each one into a small dish to check it is okay before adding it to the mix – I had a rotten one the other day and it was one of the worst things that had ever been in my kitchen!, Beat in the flour until combined, followed by the two spoonfuls of just boiled water to create a smooth batter., Divide the mix between the two cake tins, making sure you have smooth tops for even baking. Transfer to the oven and bake for 20 minutes until the sponges are springy, golden, and if you insert the tip of a cake tester or a very sharp knife it comes out clean., Run a very sharp knife around the edge of each cake to help them come out of the tins later, and leave them to cool on wire racks. Once the tins are cool enough to touch, carefully turn out the cakes to cool completely. To get an even cake, choose the best looking sponge for the top and cool that one right way up, and leave the other to cool upside down., Meanwhile to make the buttercream filling, beat together the icing sugar, butter and vanilla extract until smooth. If you need to loosen the mixture a little to make it more spreadable, add a tiny splash of milk. Only do this bit by bit, however, because if you add too much at once it can cause your icing to split. (If this does happen, add a little more icing sugar, beat hard, and keep doing this until it comes good again!), Once the sponges are completely cool place the bottom sponge upside down on a cake stand or serving dish. Spread the top with the buttercream – I use a small palette knife for this – just to the edges. Spoon a generous amount of raspberry jam on top and also spread it to the edges with the back of the spoon before popping on the lid.

Please see notes 2 for the latest updates, I don't use baking powder with chiffon cake. You don't need it if you whip your meringue properly, Make sure your chiffon cake pan does not have a non-stick coating or your cake will not rise. The cake needs to cling to the side of the pan to rise tall, Before you start making the recipe, make sure eggs, pandan juice, and coconut milk (if you keep in the fridge) are at room temperature. Get them out from the fridge 20-30 minutes and let them sit at room temperature before you plan to start working on this, Make pandan juice:, Make sure you cut the leaves into little pieces to extract the juice out from the leaves. Put in a blender and add water and process for a minute or so or until it becomes paste-like. Transfer to a cheesecloth or muslin cloth or use a strainer to squeeze the juice out. Measure out the amount of pandan juice you need and keep the leftover in the fridge for up to one week, Pandan essence is optional. It does make the color a bit brighter and the flavor a bit stronger but you don't have to use it, Prepare the cake batter:, Preheat your oven to 330 F (165 C) for conventional oven. If you have a convection oven, I suggest lowering the temperature by 20 F (15 C). Place the oven rack 3rd from the top (or adjust accordingly, you will know your oven best), Place the egg whites in a clean mixing bowl. I use a stand mixer with a whisk attachment. You will have trouble whipping your meringue if there's a trace of grease in your utensils or bowls, Separate the egg yolks from the white. The meringue whips better at room temperature. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks, cooking oil, then add coconut milk and pandan essence. Sift in the cake flour and salt into the batter, there will be no lumps when you do this. Whisk to mix into a smooth batter. Set aside, Whipping the meringue:, Beat the egg whites on medium speed until frothy, add cream of tartar or lemon juice/vinegar and whip until it turns whitish and air bubbles are fine. Gradually add the sugar as you beat, in 3 batches. I beat them at medium speed (speed 6 on Kitchen Aid). This will take a bit longer compared to beating at high speed. I used to do higher speed (speed 8), but the meringue is smoother and nicer when I maintain the speed on 6. I highly recommend stopping several times to check on the consistency and scraping the sides of the bowl to make sure no sugar left on the side of the bowl. Whip until you reach a stiff peak but still have a slight bent on the tip. Then lower the speed to 4 and whip for 1 minute to even out large bubbles and stop beating, How to know if you have overbeaten the meringue:, If you beat until the meringue clumps on the whisk attachment in one HUGE chunk/lump, you know you've gone too far beating the meringue. You will have to start over when you overbeat the meringue. If you use it, the meringue will separate when you fold it into the yolk batter and won't hold much air and your cake will deflate later, Fold meringue into the cake batter:, Gently fold 1/3 of the meringue into the thick batter. Using a whisk, using a cutting motion and fold over to mix. Repeat this motion several rounds. Continue on with the second 1/3 of the meringue again to mix. For the last 1/3 of the meringue, use a rubber spatula instead to ensure you get all the batter at the bottom of the bowl mixed in as well. Use a cut down in the middle and fold over motion to fold gently but quickly. Make sure you don't see any more white meringue. The mixture should be fluffy and voluminous., Pour the batter into an UNGREASED chiffon cake pan. Use a rubber spatula to smooth the surface. Gently drop the cake pan from about 10 cm height on the counter 2-3 times. Use a skewer to draw a zig zag to pop bubbles inside the cake batter., Baking:, Pop into the oven and let it bake for 50 minutes (for 8-inch chiffon cake), see my post above for more details on cooking time for a different size). DO NOT open your oven door at least for the first 30 minutes of baking or you will deflate the cake. Then lower the heat to 300 F (150 C) and bake for another 10-15 minutes, NOTES on baking time: Please note that the baking time is just for reference. Your oven may bake faster or slower and the type of oven you use may be different than mine, Test for doneness:, I know this is weird to say, but it's actually ""safer"" to overbake chiffon cake than underbaking. Underbaking tends to cause the cake to collapse. Usually if you insert a skewer inside the cake and no crumbs stick to it or very minimal crumbs, it is safe to say that the cake is cooked through. You can also touch the top and if it springs back, it's a good sign that it's cooked through. I like to have some golden brown on top. I don't know if you notice, but when the cake has a golden brown color on top, it's actually more flavorful too than when the cake is pale in color, Don't be alarm if your cake has some cracks on top. What you are looking at will become the bottom of your cake. I know many people mind it a lot and make a big fuss when the top of the chiffon cake cracks, but actually it's not a flaw., Invert to cool down immediately:, Once out of the oven, drop the cake pan from about 10 cm height on the counter several times to prevent shrinkage. Then carefully invert the pan upside down immediately. Your chiffon pan may have the little stands for you to invert, but I find it not high enough. I use a glass jar and set the inverted pan on top of the jar and let it cool down completely. Please don't be tempted to remove from the pan if it's still warm.

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously spray a 9 x 13-inch cake pan with cooking spray., In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a small liquid measuring cup or pitcher, whisk together the milk and vanilla., In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the egg whites. Whisk on low speed for 1 minute, then turn the mixer up to medium-high. Whisk until stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Use a wooden spoon or ladle to carefully scoop the egg whites into a medium bowl—be careful not to deflate them!, Pour the egg yolks into the stand mixer bowl (there's no need to clean the bowl!) and add the sugar. Whisk on medium until pale yellow and doubled in volume, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer to low and slowly pour in the milk mixture, whisking until just combined., Sprinkle the dry ingredients over the egg yolk mixture, then use a rubber spatula to fold in the ingredients until just combined. Scoop half of the egg whites over the mixture and fold them in with the spatula. Repeat with the remaining egg whites and fold them in until no major lumps of egg white remain and the mixture is just combined. At this point, it will be a very light and fluffy cake batter., Pour the batter into the prepared pan and use an offset spatula to smooth the top., Bake the cake. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the top of the cake bounces back when gently pressed and a skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out with a few crumbs attached. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack completely before soaking. The cake will shrink as it cools—this is normal!, Once the cake is cool, make the soak and assemble the cake. Use a fork to poke holes all over the top of the cake., In a large liquid measuring cup or pitcher, whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, coffee, and whole milk. Slowly pour the milks over the cake, a quarter cup at a time, to allow the milks to soak fully between each pour. It's likely that the cake will stop absorbing liquid about two-thirds of the way through the mixture. This is normal! It will seem like too much liquid, but trust the recipe! Loosely cover the cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the cake to absorb the milks., Before serving, make the dalgona whipped coffee cream. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the coffee and sugar. Add the hot water and immediately whisk on medium-high speed until light, airy, and doubled in volume, 2 to 4 minutes., Use a rubber spatula to scrape the dalgona whipped coffee cream over the cake. Use an offset spatula to make large, sweeping motions across the coffee cream to spread it over the cake. Garnish with cocoa powder., Serve and store.

Generously grease an 11 by 16-inch / 41 by 28cm jelly-roll pan, then line the bottom with greased parchment paper., In a large bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour and almond flour. Set aside., In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the eggs and 1/2 cup / 100g sugar on high speed for about 8 minutes. The batter should be very light in color and texture. When you lift the whisk out of the mixture, the batter should form a ribbon that sits on the surface of the egg foam for several seconds. Turn the speed to medium and continue to whip for 1 minute more. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, using the whisk attachment or a rubber spatula, gently fold the almond mixture into the egg foam in three additions., In a clean mixer bowl with a clean whisk attachment, whip the egg whites and salt on medium speed just until they start to foam. Slowly sprinkle in the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar to create a French meringue, then whip on high speed until glossy, stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, using the whisk attachment or a rubber spatula, gently fold the meringue into the almond batter., Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly with an offset spatula. Bake until the cake is set and just golden on top, 12-15 minutes. Let the cake cool completely in the pan., Make the buttercream: In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the sugar and egg yolks and beat on medium speed to mix. The mixture will be very thick and grainy., Put 1 inch / 2.5 cm of water in the bottom of a double boiler or a medium saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Place the bowl with the yolk mixture over the simmering water and stir the mixture with a rubber spatula until the sugar is completely melted. Brush down the sides of the bowl with the spatula to make sure all the sugar is melted. Feel the mixture between your fingers to check for graininess. Once all the sugar has melted and the mixture is smooth, the syrup is hot enough (140°F / 60°C) to be safe to consume., Return the bowl to the stand mixer fitted with a clean whisk attachment and beat on medium-high speed until the egg foam is light, fluffy, and glossy and the bowl feels just about room temperature. (If the egg foam isn't cooled sufficiently, the butter will melt when you add it.), Once the egg foam is whipped and cooled, turn the mixer to medium speed, add the butter, 2 tablespoons at a time, and beat until incorporated. Turn the speed to low, add the vanilla and salt, and mix until incorporated., Combine the buttercream and blackberry preserves and stir until very smooth., Make the ganache: In a medium saucepan over low heat, warm the cream until just simmering. Turn off the heat and add the chocolate. Swirl the pan to make sure all of the chocolate is submerged in the hot cream. Let sit for 3 minutes and then gently stir until smooth. Keep in pot until ready to use. You want the ganache to be a pourable consistency but not so warm that it will melt the buttercream., Assemble the cake: Using an offset spatula, spread the buttercream evenly over the cake. Transfer to the refrigerator and let set until solid, about 20 minutes. Remove the cake from the refrigerator, pour the ganache over the chilled buttercream. Refrigerate again until all layers are solid, about 45 minutes., Remove the cake from the refrigerator, run a knife all the way around the edges of the cake to loosen from the pan, cover with plastic wrap (this will protect the ganache when the cake is inverted), and invert the cake onto the back of a second baking sheet. Peel the parchment from the bottom of the cake and invert again onto a large cutting board., Using a chef's knife, cut the cake in half on the long side and then in three equal sections from the short side, so you have six identical rectangles. Stack the six sections so you have a tall cake with many layers, making sure the layers are straight. Using a knife dipped in hot water, trim any uneven cake. (At this point, you can store in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 48 hours)., Make the meringue (prepare just before decorating and serving the cake): In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, bring 1 inch / 2.5cm of water to a simmer., In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the egg whites, sugar, and salt; place over the simmering water; and stir with a rubber spatula until the mixture is hot and all of the sugar has dissolved, about 5 minutes., Remove the bowl from the heat and place onto the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, then beat on high speed until very thick and glossy and stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. If the meringue is not stiff enough, your spikes will slouch and lose the drama. Add the vanilla and mix well., Take a blob of the meringue topping between your fingers and press it against a blackberry. Pull the blob away, it will break off in a wispy curl.

In the yolks, add half of the sugar and whip it up with your mixer until its pale yellow, fluffy and has tripled in volume. Add vanilla extract and mix. The batter should fall in a ribbon., In another bowl, whip up the whites with the remaining sugar (add it all at once) until stiff peaks form. This will take some time., In a bowl, combine the flour with the baking powder and salt and sift half of it into the bowl with the egg yolks. Using a spatula, fold the flour into the egg yolks and add pour in milk slowly to help it combine. Once the flour has incorporated completely, fold in the egg whites very carefully so as not to deflate the batter. When folding, I scoop the batter and drop it in itself until all of the whites have been added and fully incorporated into the batter. Do not use a whisk., Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 20 mins or until the top becomes golden brown and a skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.

Once tiny bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan, add crushed green cardamoms and let it steam for a few minutes. The flavor of the cardamom really pulls through in this cake! The cardamom is optional. If you don't want to use it, then skip this step and just add evaporated milk with the other milks., Strain the evaporated milk into a jug or mixing bowl and then pour the condensed milk and cream. Give the three milks a good whisk and then pour it very slowly on the cake making sure you cover the entire surface slowly. The liquid may look plenty but trust me the sponge cake (with all those tiny holes) will absorb all of it in half an hour.

I highly encourage you to weigh your ingredients using a kitchen scale for this recipe. Click on the “Metric“ button at the top of the recipe to convert the ingredient measurements to metric. If you‘re using a cup measurement, please follow the “fluff and sprinkle“ method: Fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle the flour into your measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more flour than you need., Preheat the oven to 340ºF (170ºC). For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). You will need a 17-cm (7-inch) chiffon cake pan. If you have a different size pan, read this post to adjust the ingredient measurements. Make sure you use an aluminum pan with a removable base (read my blog post for more details). Please see my Notes at the end of this recipe for additional details on ingredients, equipment, and techniques., To make tea powder, put 2 tsp Earl Grey loose tea leaves in a food processor (I used a Nutribullet here). Grind them to a fine powder. Alternatively, you can use a mortar and pestle to grind the tea leaves, or put tea leaves in a bag and crush them. Transfer to a small bowl and set it aside., To brew strong tea, put 1 Tbsp Earl Grey loose tea leaves in a fine sieve over a bowl. Next, pour 6 Tbsp hot water over the tea leaves to steep. Let it cool, then remove the tea leaves. Measure 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of this brewed tea and set it aside., Separate 3 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) into egg yolks and whites. Keep the eggs whites in a stand mixer bowl; refrigerate or freeze the bowl and egg whites for 15 minutes until cold. (It‘s okay if the egg whites are partially frozen). Tip: In Japan, we chill the egg whites to make smooth, fine-textured meringue and do not use cream of tartar., To Mix the Batter, Start mixing the batter. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks and one-third of the 85 g sugar with a hand whisk. Whisk vigorously until it‘s a creamy pale yellow color., Add 40 ml neutral oil and 4 Tbsp brewed tea to the egg mixture. Whisk all together until combined., Add the powdered Earl Grey tea to the egg mixture and mix well., To a flour sifter or fine-mesh sieve, add 75 g cake flour and 1 tsp baking powder. Sift one-third of this flour mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Whisk by hand to incorporate the dry ingredients well. Check that there are no lumps in the batter, then sift another one-third of the flour mixture into the bowl. Mix to incorporate. Then, sift in the rest of the flour mixture and whisk until just combined; do not overmix. Make sure there are no lumps in the batter. Set aside while you beat the meringue., To Make the Meringue, Take out the bowl of egg whites from the refrigerator or freezer. Set the bowl on the stand mixer with a whisk attachment (I used the KitchenAid Professional Series). Start whipping the egg whites on medium-low speed (Speed 4) until the egg whites are bubbly, opaque, and foamy.Add another one-third of the sugar and continue whisking for 30 seconds. Then, increase the mixer speed to high (Speed 10) and gradually add the remaining sugar in small increments. Beat vigorously until stiff peaks form. It takes about 2 minutes of beating at high speed to reach stiff peaks. Tip: I usually pause beating when the egg whites are almost done. Take off the whisk attachment from the mixer and use it to hand-mix the looser egg whites near the bowl‘s edge into the stiffer whites near the center until it‘s all homogenous in texture. Then, put the whisk back on and continue beating.To check for stiff peaks, pull up your whisk. The meringue in the bowl or on the whisk should be firm enough to hold a peak, pointing straight up (or maybe folding over a little bit just at the very tips). By this time, the meringue should have a glossy texture, too. Tip: If you overbeat the meringue, it will become very stiff and grainy and won‘t incorporate into the batter at all., To Fold In the Meringue, Using a spatula or hand whisk, add one-third of the meringue into the batter. Mix well by hand until it‘s homogeneous., Gently fold in the rest of the meringue in 2 or 3 increments. Take care not to deflate the air bubbles in the meringue and batter as you fold. Once it‘s well combined and homogenous, fold the batter one last time and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure there is no tea powder accumulation. The final batter should fall in ribbons when you lift the spatula or whisk., To Bake, Prepare an ungreased 17-cm (7-inch) chiffon cake pan. From 6–8 inches high, pour the batter into the pan at just one spot to prevent air pockets from forming. While holding the removable base in place, gently tap the pan a few times on the work surface to release any air pockets in the batter. Run a wooden skewer through the batter to release any remaining air pockets., Put the cake pan on the middle rack of the preheated oven. Bake at 340ºF (170ºC) for 30 minutes. To check if it‘s finished baking, insert a toothpick or wooden skewer into the middle of the cake. If it comes out clean and the top of the cake springs back when gently pressed, it‘s done. Tip: If the top of the cake gets dark too quickly, cover the top loosely with aluminum foil to prevent burning. (The cake may be too close to the heat source.), Remove the cake pan from the oven and gently drop the pan onto the work surface to shock the cake. This stops the cake from shrinking. To cool the cake, prepare a tall, heavy bottle with a long neck, such as a glass wine bottle. Invert the center tube of the cake pan onto the bottle‘s neck and let the cake cool completely in its pan. Cooling the cake upside down helps it stretch downward and maintain its loft.Once the cake is completely cool, run a long offset spatula around the outer edge of the pan and a small offset spatula around the inner tube. Gently take out the removable base and cake from the outer pan. Then, run the offset spatula along the bottom of the cake to release it from the base. Tip: I used to use a knife for this step, but the tip of the knife tends to poke the cake while moving around, so I now recommend using offset spatulas., To Serve, Invert the cake with the removable base onto a plate or cake stand. The cake will slide off the inner tube. Chiffon cake is served “upside down” with the flat bottom on top. Dust confectioners’ sugar on top, if you‘d like. Slice and enjoy., To Store, I strongly recommend consuming the cake sooner for the best freshness. However, you can keep the cake covered on a plate or stand at room temperature in a cooler place for 1–2 days. To keep it longer, wrap individual slices in plastic wrap or put in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for 3 days or in the freezer for 2 weeks.","[('earl grey', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('earl grey', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('water', 6.0, 'tbsp'), ('eggs', 3.0, None), ('sugar', 85.0, 'g'), ('oil', 40.0, 'ml'), ('cake flour', 75.0, 'g'), ('baking powder', 1.0, 'tsp')]"

Pour the white granulated sugar (labeled “for meringue”) into a small bowl so it’s easy to add to the egg whites while mixing.With a hand or stand mixer and the whisk attachment, beat on medium-high speed until it’s thick and foamy. It will look like men’s shaving cream (you know the kind they make at a fancy barber shop with a whisk?) Pour in about a couple of teaspoons of sugar, continue to whisk, and then pour another couple. No need to be precise on the amount of sugar, but wait about 5-10 seconds between additions to allow the sugar to dissolve a little before adding more., Once all the sugar has been added, continue to whisk until you reach stiff and glossy peaks. When you pull up some meringue with the whisk attachment, you should see a point when you hold it upside down, and it shouldn’t be runny or drooping off the whisk., Take a spatula-sized small scoop of meringue and stir it into the batter using the whisk - this lightens the batter.Now take 1/3 of your freshly whipped meringue and fold it into the cake batter. Use swooping motions to scoop the batter from the sides and pile it towards the center. Make sure you scrape the bottom of the bowl once in a while. (My video shows this technique much better than I can describe it.) Once the batter has just a few streaks of meringue left, add the second third and continue to fold. Finish with the final third of the meringue. The batter should not have any lines of meringue, be light chocolate brown, and be much more lightweight in texture., Evenly distribute the batter into the prepared pans., Bake for about 30-35 mins. This is how you know a chiffon cake is done and won’t collapse too much when you remove it from the oven: during the last 5 mins of baking, watch the tops of your cake. They will rise very high, then shrink down to almost the level of the pan. This is a sign your cake is done. You can double-check with a skewer (no crumbs should come out) or the internal temp of the cake (around 205-210 °F/96-99 °C)., Move the pans to a wire rack and let them sit for about 3-5 minutes. Take the wire rack, place it over the cake pan, and flip it over. (It may be a little taller than the pan if your pan is only 2 inches tall. It’s ok; just put the wire rack on top.) And don’t worry, it won’t fall out. Because we didn’t treat the sides of the pan with any fat or paper, the cake will stay inside the pan until you use a knife to loosen the cake from the pan., Loosen the edges of the cakes using an offset spatula or butter knife, and flip the cakes out onto a cooling rack so you can peel off the parchment bottom. Make sure they are completely cool before assembling and/or frosting.","[('water', 160.0, 'g'), ('oil', 74.0, 'g'), ('egg yolks', 80.0, 'g'), ('cake flour', 160.0, 'g'), ('cocoa powder', 44.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 132.0, 'g'), ('baking powder', 1.5, 'tsp'), ('salt', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('egg whites', 120.0, 'g'), ('cream of tartar', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('sugar', 100.0, 'g')]"

Bring to a simmer over medium heat, smashing berries slightly as you stir, until blueberries are softened and bursting., Transfer to a blender or food processor (take caution when blending hot liquids) and purée until completely smooth. You should have 1 cup of blueberry purée., Measure out 1/2 cup of purée and place back into saucepan. Put the remainder in a jar or airtight container and refrigerate it for later (you will need it for the blueberry mousse)., Cut gelatin sheets into 1-inch strips and submerge in cool water for at least 5 minutes to soften. If using powdered gelatin, sprinkle 1 1/2 teaspoons over 2 tablespoons of cool water., Add remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice, along with 2 tablespoons water to saucepan with purée. Heat until it just barely begins to bubble., Wring out softened gelatin with your hands, squeezing out as much water as you can (for powdered gelatin, just add it straight to the pan, liquid and all). Add to saucepan with warm blueberry mixture and whisk until completely dissolved., Pour blueberry mixture into 1-inch silicone sphere molds. Alternatively, you can use a parchment-lined cake or baking pan (about 8 inches in size). Line with parchment, leaving handles overhanging the sides to allow for easy removal of the set gelatin. You'll cut 'coins' of gelée out of this larger piece, instead of using small half-spheres in your cakes., Refrigerate overnight until completely set, then gently remove from molds (it might help to freeze for 20 or 30 minutes to make the spheres easier to remove)., To make the sponge cake:, Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a quarter sheet pan (approximately 13-by-9-inches in size) with aluminum foil or a silicone baking mat; grease or butter foil (parchment works as well, though I found it wrinkled the cake a bit)., Place egg yolks in a bowl; vigorously whisk with 3 tablespoons of sugar until lightened in color. Whisk in milk and almond extract., Sift in the cake flour and almond flour; add salt and fold until just incorporated., In a clean bowl, whip egg whites until frothy. Add remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and beat until whites hold medium peaks. Fold 1/3 of whites into batter mixture to lighten, then scrape the batter mixture into the bowl with the whites, folding until just incorporated and no pure white streaks remain., Pour batter into prepared sheet pan, spread into a thin, even layer. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes or until cake is spongy to the touch and just barely starting to darken around the edges. Let cool completely., For the blueberry mousse:, Cut gelatin into 1-inch strips and submerge in cool water to soften., Meanwhile, rewarm reserved 1/2 cup blueberry purée in a saucepan over medium heat until it is once again smooth (whisk it vigorously to break up any remaining chunks left after refrigeration). Wring out water from softened gelatin and add to warm blueberry purée; whisk until smooth. Set aside and let cool to lukewarm., In a clean bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat heavy cream until frothy, then slowly add powdered sugar. Add mascarpone, then continue to whip until it holds soft peaks. Add almond and vanilla extract, then fold in cooled blueberry mixture until fully incorporated., To assemble your cakes, spoon or pipe the mousse into silicone molds, not quite all the way full. Gently press a gelée sphere, curved side down, into the top of each mousse-filled mold. Scrape with an offset spatula to make the top perfectly level with the top of the mold. Finally, cut out rounds of sponge cake exactly the same size as the base of the molds and press onto the top of the mousse. Freeze at least 3 hours or overnight until completely firm., Before you make the glaze, remove cakes from molds and place on a frozen cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Return to freezer until just before glazing., For Mirror Glaze:, Cut gelatin into 1-inch strips and submerge in cool water for at least 5 minutes to soften. Place white chocolate in a heat-proof bowl and set aside., Combine sugar, corn syrup, and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat until sugar is completely dissolved and mixture is clear., Remove from heat, then add gelatin (squeeze out as much water as possible first) and whisk until dissolved. Whisk in sweetened condensed milk. Pour hot mixture over chopped white chocolate and let sit for 30 seconds, then stir until chocolate is completely melted and mixture is smooth (you can also use an immersion blender if you have one to expedite this process, just try not to mix air bubbles into the glaze if possible)., Let glaze cool, stirring occasionally, until glaze reaches approximately 95 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. The glaze needs to be the correct temperature or it will not form a thick enough layer on the outside of the cakes., When the glaze reaches 95-96 degrees, add powder or gel food coloring as desired. Darker colors tend to look particularly striking with this glaze technique. You can also divide your glaze up into multiple colors and then swirl them if you'd like., Remove cakes from freezer and place on a parchment lined cookie sheet, elevated off the sheet using small jars or cookie cutters (ideally something smaller in diameter than the cake itself so the glaze can drip off). You may also want to cut out small rounds of cardboard (I used an old bakery box) to place under each cake to make them easier to transfer. If you have more than 6 or 8 individual cakes, I recommend working in two batches. You can always rewarm the glaze if it gets too cool (do so gently over a double boiler or in very short intervals in the microwave)., Pour glaze generously over cakes, taking care to ensure there are no bare spots left. Allow the excess glaze to drip off for 5 or 10 minutes, then gently scrape the edges to remove any remaining drops. Carefully transfer cakes using a small offset spatula to cardboard cake rounds or small pieces of parchment paper for easy movement. Any leftover glaze can be scraped up and refrigerated in an airtight container for later use., Glazed cakes will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Let come to room temperature before serving.","[('blueberries', 8.0, 'oz'), ('sugar', 0.25, 'cup'), ('lemon juice', 3.0, 'teaspoons'), ('leaf gelatin', 1.5, 'sheets'), ('water', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('eggs', 2.0, None), ('sugar', 0.25, 'cup'), ('milk', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('almond extract', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('cake flour', 6.0, 'tablespoons'), ('almond flour', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('sea salt', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('leaf gelatin', 3.0, 'sheets'), ('blueberry purée', 0.5, 'cup'), ('mascarpone cheese', 0.5, 'cup'), ('powdered sugar', 0.25, 'cup'), ('whipping cream', 0.75, 'cup'), ('vanilla extract', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('almond extract', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('sea salt', None, None), ('leaf gelatin', 6.0, 'sheets'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('corn syrup', 0.67, 'cup'), ('water', 0.5, 'cup'), ('sweetened condensed milk', 0.5, 'cup'), ('white chocolate', 7.0, 'ounces')]"

Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form when you lift the whisk from the beaten egg whites. Scrape the egg whites into another bowl. Rinse and dry the standing mixer bowl., Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment and cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 6 minutes. Stop the mixer to scrape down the sides of the bowl a time or two., Add two of the egg yolks and beat until incorporated, about 20 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.

If baking 3 layers, bake for 30-40 min. If baking four layers, bake for 25-30 minutes. The cakes will be golden brown, pulling away from the sides of the pan, and will not jiggle in the center when you shake the pan slightly. To check for doneness, stick a toothpick into the center of one of the layers. Remove the toothpick and look for signs of raw batter. If only cake crumbs stick to the toothpick, the cake is done. You can also scoop a tiny amount of cake from the center of one of the layers to check for doneness. (You’ll be covering the cake with frosting anyway.), Let the cakes cool on wire racks for 5 minutes in the pan, then gently turn them out of the pans onto the wire racks to cool completely.

Add half of the sugar and continue to beat for another one minute, then add the rest of the sugar., Continue to beat the egg whites for about 5-7 minutes total or until you have stiff peaks. You can test this by turning off your stand mixer, unhooking the whisk attachment, and turning it upside down to see if the peaks keep their shape., Baking, Using a spatula, take about ¼ of the meringue and add it into the cake batter. Use a whisk to dilute the thickness of the cake batter with the meringue until it’s completely incorporated., Then use the spatula to add the rest of the meringue into the diluted batter. Use a very soft folding method to combine the meringue and batter by holding your spatula like a knife, slicing it down the middle of the bowl, and folding the batter over the left side of the bowl (or right side if you are left-handed)., Keep rotating the bowl slightly before each fold until your meringue and cake batter are combined. Here's how the final batter texture should look., Divide batter between the two pans, then slightly tap them on the counter to remove any excess bubbles. Place your cake pans on a large sheet pan and place them on the middle rack of your oven. Pour boiling water in the sheet pan for the water bath or “bain marie” and stop at about ½ inch from the bottom of the pan. Check on the water levels for the bain marie every 15 minutes., Bake the cake for approximately 30-45 minutes or until it’s firm in the center. After 30 minutes, test the cake with a toothpick or cake tester by poking it in the middle. The toothpick should come out smoothly and clean—if it doesn’t, keep baking and testing every few 5 minutes until it does., Remove the cakes and immediately turn them upside down on top of a wire rack without releasing them from the pan. Leave on the counter until they are cool to the touch. Cooling upside prevents the cake from deflating., Frosting, In a stand mixer, add the softened butter and whip on level 8 for about 5 minutes or until it turns into a light and airy texture. Make sure to scrape down the sides every so often to make sure all the butter gets aerated., Lower the level to 6. Sift the powdered sugar and add half the sugar into the stand mixer.

Mix just until all the flour has been added (there will still be streaks in the batter) and then pour in the melted butter. Continue mixing until just incorporated, no more (that's about 5 seconds, tops) Whatever you do, DO NOT overmix the batter, as this would seriously deflate your eggs. Delicately finish mixing the batter with a rubber spatula and then divide equally between the 2 prepared pans.

Grease a 12×17-inch half sheet pan, then line with parchment paper. Pan size is imperative. This batter won’t fit into anything smaller. Likewise, the cake would be too thin if baked in larger pans., Make the cake, Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the cream cheese and beat on high speed until completely smooth and combined, about 1 minute.

Then cut each long rectangle into 3 smaller rectangles. You’ll now have 6 rectangles. Very carefully and slowly slice each in half as shown in the video above—as if you were making a 1 layer cake a 2 layer cake. You now have 12 thin rectangles., Make the vanilla buttercream:, With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, heavy cream, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 full minutes. Add up to 1/4 cup more confectioners’ sugar if frosting is too thin or another Tablespoon of cream if frosting is too thick. Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. (I always add a pinch.), Add fillings, With a sharp knife, trim the ends off the rectangles that touched the pan. They’re a little harder and uneven, which would create lopsided petit fours. Spread vanilla buttercream in a thick even layer on 4 rectangles. Spread both lemon curd and raspberry jam on 4 rectangles. (The remaining 4 rectangles are plain because they are the tops.) Go a little lighter on the raspberry jam and lemon curd compared to the vanilla buttercream. If there’s too much, it creates a big mess when cutting the petit fours., Layer the petit fours, Place the lemon curd/raspberry jam rectangles on top of the vanilla buttercream rectangles. Layer the plain rectangle on top. Loosely cover each and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or freeze for 1 hour.

Grease and line three 6″ cake pans with oil and parchment paper, including the walls of the pans. Set aside., Make the stiff peaked aquafaba:, In a stand mixer with whisk attachment or in a large bowl and hand mixer, beat the aquafaba and cream of tartar on medium speed until it starts to foam, about 3 minutes. Add in 1/3 cup of the granulated sugar, and continue beating on medium-high speed to high speed until you achieve nearly stiff peaks. This process takes me about 10-12 minutes with a stand mixer. You don’t want the peaks to droop at all. Usually when I’ve beaten the mixture enough, I actually still need 2-3 more minutes, bringing me to 10-12 minutes. Once you’ve achieved nearly stiff peaks, set the bowl aside., Make the cake batter, In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, remaining sugar, baking powder, and sea salt. Set aside. In a medium bowl, use a whisk to combine the dairy free milk, unsweetened applesauce, olive oil, and vanilla extract. Add in the flour mixture, and continue to whisk just until the dry has incorporated into the wet ingredients. Pour the cake batter into the large bowl containing the aquafaba mixture. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the batter into the aquafaba, mixing until there are just no more white steaks of aquafaba. Be careful not to deflate the stiff peaks too much by over mixing., Bake the cakes, divide the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans, Place the cake pans into the oven and bake the cakes for 30-32 minutes, or until the toothpick comes out clean. The cakes will look lightly golden on top. When you remove them from the oven, allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes. The cakes will slightly sink, but that’s okay. As long as they’re not caving into the middle, you’re fine! Once the cakes have cooled in the pans for a few minutes, you can carefully transfer them to a cooling rack to cool completely before making the vegan Swiss meringue frosting. Please keep in mind that the cakes will be delicate- more so than a vegan vanilla cake. Please handle with care!, Make the vegan Swiss meringue buttercream, once your cakes have fully cooled, you can begin to make your frosting. If you’d prefer to make a vegan vanilla buttercream in lieu of a Swiss meringue buttercream, you may do so! To start: in a stand mixer or large bowl and hand mixer, cream the vegan butter for 2-3 minutes until fluffy. Add in aquafaba, and continue creaming until the mixture begins to whiten and turn even fluffier. Then add in the powdered sugar, and continue creaming the mixture until smooth and slightly glossy., Assemble the chiffon cake, use the frosting immediately for the cake. Use about 2/3 of the frosting to layer the cake, and crumb coat the edges. Then use the remaining frosting to create the final coating. It’s easiest to chill the cake for 20-30 minutes in between the crumb coat and the final frosting layer. You can also place the frosting into the fridge to keep cold while the cake is chilling.

Lightly grease the parchment paper and the sides of the baking sheet with oil (you can also spray it with non-stick baking spray).Tip: Greasing the parchment paper ensures that the baked sponge will smoothly release from it without sticking., Mix the instant coffee granules with the milk and heat them (either in the microwave or on the stovetop) until the mixture is hot and the coffee is fully dissolved. Set aside to cool until warm or at room temperature., Using a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or a hand mixer fitted with the double beaters, whisk the eggs and sugar together until pale, thick, fluffy and about tripled in volume (the ribbon stage). This should take about 5-7 minutes on a high speed setting., Add the coffee-milk mixture, vanilla and melted butter, and whisk briefly until combined., In a separate bowl, sift together the gluten free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, baking soda and salt., Add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture and whisk well for about 15-30 seconds until no flour clumps remain. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl to prevent any unmixed patches., Transfer the batter into the lined baking sheet and smooth it out into an even layer. You can tap it a few times on the counter to make it perfectly level and also to get rid of any large trapped air pockets., Bake at 350ºF (180ºC) for about 10-12 minutes or until well risen, soft and spongy to the touch, and an inserted toothpick comes out clean., Immediately out of the oven, cover the baking sheet with a large sheet of aluminium foil. Allow to cool to room temperature or lukewarm – ideally, the temperature of the sponge shouldn't drop below 72ºF (22ºC).Tip: Covering the sponge with aluminium foil traps the moisture within the sponge, making it much more pliable and flexible – and therefore less likely to crack when you roll it., Mascarpone whipped cream filling:, You can prepare this filling using a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or with a hand mixer fitted with the double beaters., Combine all the filling ingredients in a large bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer, if using) and whip them to very soft peaks. Tip 1: Be careful not to over-whip the filling, as it does firm up with time, even if it’s just standing on the counter waiting to be used in the Swiss roll.Tip 2: Regardless of whether you use a stand or a hand mixer, I recommend whisking the filling on a low speed setting. This gives you better control over the texture/consistency of the filling and it lowers the chances of over-whipping it., Coffee soak:, Mix together the coffee granules, sugar and hot water for the ""coffee soak"", until the coffee and sugar are fully dissolved., Allow to cool until warm or at room temperature., Assembling the Swiss roll:, Once sufficiently cooled, gently loosen the sponge from the edges of the baking sheet with an offset spatula or a thin knife. Lightly dust the top of the sponge with powdered/icing sugar, to prevent sticking., Turn it out onto a large sheet of parchment/baking paper, so that the caramelised “skin” side is facing down (so that it’s on the outside of the Swiss roll when you roll it up)., Peel away the parchment paper that used to line the baking sheet., Use a pastry brush to gently brush the sponge with the coffee soak. You might not need all of it – don’t over-soak the sponge, as that can make it too fragile., Spread just over half of the mascarpone filling evenly across the sponge, all the way to the edges., Turn the sponge so that a short edge is closest to you. Using the parchment/baking paper underneath to help you, roll up the sponge until you get a 10 inch (25cm) long log.Tip: Make sure to keep the roll fairly tight from the very beginning, otherwise you’ll be left with an empty hole in the centre of your Swiss roll., Use the remaining mascarpone filling to cover the outside of the cake (you can cover the ends of the cake or leave them ""open"" as I've done – see blog post for photos). For a fairly rustic look, use a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon to create loose swirls and swoops of the mascarpone cream., Chilling & decorating the tiramisu Swiss roll:, At this stage, I recommend chilling the Swill roll overnight (or at least for 1-2 hours) before serving, to achieve both the best flavour and texture.However, if you’re in a hurry (or just very impatient) you can also serve it straight away., Just before serving, dust the Swiss roll generously with cocoa powder and sprinkle on some chocolate shavings., Storage:, The tiramisu Swiss roll keeps well in a closed container in the fridge for 4-5 days.","[ ('sunflower oil', 2.0, 'tbsp'),  ('instant coffee granules', 2.0, 'tbsp'),  ('whole milk', 4.0, 'tsp'),  ('eggs', 3.0, None),  ('sugar', 125.0, 'g'),  ('vanilla bean paste', 1.0, 'tsp'),  ('butter', 45.0, 'g'),  ('gluten free flour', 80.0, 'g'),  ('xanthan gum', 0.75, 'tsp'),  ('baking powder', 0.5, 'tsp'),  ('baking soda', 0.25, 'tsp'),  ('salt', 0.25, 'tsp'),  ('mascarpone cheese', 250.0, 'g'),  ('double cream', 160.0, 'g'),  ('powdered sugar', 60.0, 'g'),  ('instant coffee granules', 4.0, 'g'),  ('granulated sugar', 12.0, 'g'),  ('hot water', 45.0, 'g'),  ('powdered sugar', 2.0, 'tbsp'),  ('cocoa powder', 2.0, 'tbsp'),  ('chocolate shavings', None, None) ]"

I highly encourage you to use metric measurements using a kitchen scale for this recipe. Click on the “Metric“ button at the top of the recipe to convert the ingredient measurements to metric. If you‘re using a cup measurement, please follow the “fluff and sprinkle“ method: Fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle the flour into your measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more flour than you need., You will also need a 17-cm (7-inch) chiffon cake pan. If you have a different size pan, read this post to adjust the ingredient measurements. Make sure you use an aluminum pan with a removable base (read my blog post for more details). Please see my Notes at the end of this recipe for additional details on ingredients, equipment, and techniques., To Mix the Batter, Preheat the oven to 340ºF (170ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Separate the egg yolks and egg whites of 3 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell), and keep the whites in a small bowl or a stand mixer bowl. Refrigerate or freeze the mixer bowl and the egg whites for 15 minutes until cold. (It‘s okay if the egg whites are partially frozen). Tip: In Japan, we chill the egg whites to make smooth, fine-textured meringue and do not use cream of tartar., Start mixing the batter. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks and one-third of the 85 g sugar (½ cup minus 1 Tbsp) with a hand whisk. Whisk vigorously until it‘s a creamy, pale yellow color., Next, add 40 ml neutral oil (3 Tbsp minus 1 tsp) and the zest of up to 2 Meyer lemons. Tip: I love the intense fragrance and sweetness of Meyer lemons, so I use the zest of 2 lemons. You can use 1, if you‘d prefer., Cut the Meyer lemons in half. Juice all 4 halves into a measuring cup., Measure 4 Tbsp (¼ cup or 60 ml) lemon juice. If you don‘t have enough juice, add water to make up the difference., Add the lemon juice to the egg mixture and whisk well., To a flour sifter or fine-mesh sieve, add 75 g cake flour (⅔ cup minus 2 tsp) and 1 tsp baking powder. Sift one-third of this flour mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Whisk by hand to incorporate the dry ingredients well. Check that there are no lumps in the batter, then sift another one-third of the flour mixture into the bowl. Mix to incorporate. Then, sift in the rest of the flour mixture and whisk until just combined; do not overmix. Make sure there are no lumps in the batter. Set aside while you beat the meringue., To Make the Meringue, Take out the egg whites and the mixing bowl from the refrigerator or freezer. Set the bowl on the stand mixer with a whisk attachment (I used the KitchenAid Professional Series). Start whipping the egg whites on medium-low speed (Speed 4) until the egg whites are bubbly, opaque, and foamy. Add another one-third of the remaining sugar and continue whisking., After 30 seconds or so, increase the mixer speed to high (Speed 10) and gradually add the remaining sugar in small increments. Beat vigorously until stiff peaks form (see the next step for how to check). It takes about 2 minutes of beating at high speed to reach stiff peaks. Tip: I usually pause beating when the egg whites are almost done. Take off the whisk attachment from the mixer and use it to hand-mix the looser egg whites near the bowl‘s edge into the stiffer whites near the center until it‘s homogeneous in texture. Then, put the whisk back on and continue beating., To check for stiff peaks, pull up your whisk. The meringue in the bowl or on the whisk should be firm enough to hold a peak, pointing straight up (or maybe folding over a little bit just at the very tips). By this time, the meringue should have a glossy texture, too. Tip: If you overbeat the meringue, it will become very stiff and grainy and won't incorporate into the batter at all., To Fold In the Meringue, Using a spatula or hand whisk, add one-third of the meringue into the batter. Mix well by hand until it‘s homogeneous., Gently fold in the rest of the meringue in 2 or 3 increments. Take care not to deflate the air bubbles in the meringue and batter as you fold. Once it‘s well combined and homogeneous, fold the batter one last time and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure there is no zest accumulation. The final batter should fall in ribbons when you lift the spatula or whisk., To Bake, Prepare an ungreased 17-cm (7-inch) chiffon cake pan. From 6–8 inches high, pour the batter into the pan at just one spot to prevent air pockets from forming., Run a wooden skewer through the batter to release any remaining air pockets. While holding the removable base in place, gently tap the pan a few times on the work surface to release any air pockets in the batter., Put the cake pan on the middle rack of the preheated oven. Bake at 340ºF (170ºC) for 30 minutes. To check if it‘s finished baking, insert a toothpick or wooden skewer into the middle of the cake. If it comes out clean and the top of the cake springs back when gently pressed, it‘s done. Tip: If the top of the cake gets dark too quickly, cover the top loosely with aluminum foil to prevent burning. (The cake may be too close to the heat source.), Remove the cake pan from the oven and gently drop the pan onto the work surface to shock the cake. This stops the cake from shrinking. To cool the cake, prepare a tall, heavy bottle with a long neck, such as a glass wine bottle. Invert the center tube of the cake pan onto the bottle‘s neck and let the cake cool completely in its pan. Cooling the cake upside down helps it stretch downward and maintain its loft., Once the cake is completely cool, run a long offset spatula around the outer edge of the pan and a small offset spatula around the inner tube. Tip: I used to use a knife for this step, but the tip of the knife tends to poke the cake while moving around, so I now recommend using offset spatulas., Gently take out the removable base and cake from the outer pan. Then, run the offset spatula along the bottom of the cake to release it from the base. Invert the cake with the removable base onto a plate or cake stand. The cake will slide off the inner tube. Chiffon cake is served “upside down” with the flat bottom on top., To Serve, Dust the top of the cake with 2 Tbsp confectioners’ sugar (optional), if you‘d like. Alternatively, you can top the cake with Meyer Lemon Icing Glaze (optional). To make the glaze, place ½ cup confectioners’ sugar in a small bowl and stir in the juice of ½ Meyer lemon. The glaze should be thick, but pourable. Add more sugar or Meyer lemon juice as necessary to achieve the desired consistency. Drizzle over the cake using a spoon. Slice and enjoy!, To Store, I strongly recommend consuming the cake sooner for the best freshness. However, you can keep the cake covered on a plate or stand at room temperature in a cooler place for 1–2 days. To keep it longer, wrap individual slices in plastic wrap or put in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for 3 days or in the freezer for 2 weeks.","[('eggs', 3.0, 'large'), ('sugar', 85.0, 'g'), ('neutral oil', 40.0, 'ml'), ('lemons', 2.0, None), ('cake flour', 75.0, 'g'), ('baking powder', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('confectioners’ sugar', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('confectioners’ sugar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('meyer lemon', 0.5, None)]"

Do not use wax paper because it can't handle the high temperature of the candy. Crease the edges slightly to help it sit in the pan. You will be pouring the candy onto the parchment., Combine the sugar and corn syrup in a large saucepan (the pan must is large to allow room for the syrup space to foam up). On medium heat, stir until the sugar is dissolved, then stop stirring but continue to cook., Sift the baking soda so no lumps remain and set near the stove., When the syrup cones to a boil, begin checking the temperature periodically with an instant read thermometer. After it has been boiling about 5-10 minutes it will start to turn just slightly yellow which means it is nearing the proper temperature of 295 F. If the syrup is heating very unevenly, swirl the syrup in the pan and lower the heat slightly., When the syrup reaches 295 F, stir in the sifted baking soda until just mixed. It may foam up or if already very bubbly, may sink. Immediately pour the mixture into the parchment lined pan disturbing it as little as possible. Don’t worry that it doesn’t fill the pan and don’t level it--you are trying to keep the bubbles intact., If cooling at room temperature, leave the pan completely undisturbed., If using the oven cool method, put the pan in a 225 F oven then turn off the heat. Let sit for 15 minutes, then remove to finish cooling., Preparing the Chocolate and Dipping, When the candy is completely cool and firm (may take up to a couple hours—I left mine overnight), prepare the chocolate. Chop the chocolate fine and set aside. Then melt the cocoa butter (or substitute) in the microwave. Heat in 30 second bursts, stirring between bursts until melted., Add about ¼ cup chopped chocolate to the cocoa butter. Stir until partly melted, then heat again for 10 seconds. Using the instant read thermometer, take the temperature of the chocolate every time you take it out of the microwave., Your goal is to keep dark chocolate under 92 F or milk chocolate under 86 F. If the temperature is getting too close to the max, use shorter microwave bursts or stir for longer in between bursts. When chocolate is melted, add another ¼ cup and continue until it’s all melted., To break the candy for dipping, score it with a knife, then break it by hand along the score lines., Drop the candy into the melted chocolate one piece at a time, then roll it and pull it out with a fork., Cool on a cooling rack until hardened.

Wash and cut rhubarb stalks in 2"" sections, put them in the bowl of a food processor and process until then turn into a pulp. Push it through a fine sieve with a spoon to extract all the juice, then discard the pulp. You should get about 300 ml/ 1¼ cup of rhubarb juice., In a food processor or blender mix eggs, sugar and cornflour/corn starch until you have a homogenous mixture with no lumps remaining. Alternatively you can do this step by hand using a bowl and a whisk., In a saucepan combine 1 cup of rhubarb juice, egg, sugar and corn starch mixture and cubed butter, set the pan over low heat and star cooking it while stirring with a whisk the entire time until butter melts and the curd thickens. Do not turn the heat up to speed up the process or the eggs will turn into scrambled eggs and the curd go lumpy!, Take off the heat when the curd is the consistency of thick sour cream. You may push it through a fine sieve again to ensure there are no lumps and the curd is silky smooth. Add the remaining rhubarb juice to increase the tart flavour of the rhubarb and a drop of pink food colouring if desired as the curd loses its colour when cooks!, Chill in the fridge for at least 3 hours or overnight. The rhubarb curd will thicken when chilled., For the Cake, Preheat the oven to 350F/180C., Grease 3 8"" cake pans and line them with parchment paper.

Your goal is to keep the volume of the egg mixture so be very careful in this step of the process., Divide your cake batter among 3 pans, I weigh mine to make sure they are exactly the same and bake for 25-30 minutes until cake tester or tooth pick comes out clean and the cakes have risen to the top of the pan. (I baked 2 layers and then 1 later)., Cool for 10 minutes and then run a knife around the edges of your pans to release the cakes and flip them over on a wire rack to cool completely., (After your cakes have cooled you can individually wrap them in plastic wrap for later use. You can bake you sponge layers up to 2 days ahead.), For the Syrup, In a measuring cup mix together simple syrup, elderflower liqueur for beautiful floral notes and 2-3 drops of rose water, the amount of which largely depends on the strength of it. Each brand is different, so it's important to taste and smell to determine the desired amount. Add with caution as it can smell like a perfume instead of a dessert if too much rose water is used., For the Mascarpone Cream, In a bowl of a stand mixer whip well-chilled mascarpone for no longer than 30 seconds with a balloon attachment until light, add heavy/double cream, icing sugar, vanilla and rose water and whip for 1-2 minutes longer until it looks like thick whipped cream. If your mascarpone cream is too thick and hard to spread add a splash of heavy/double cream and whip for just a few seconds longer to loosen it., Assemble the cake, Load 1/3 of mascarpone cream in a large piping bag with a plain round tip., Pipe a border around the first drizzled with syrup layer, this will prevent rhubarb curd filling from spilling out, fill the space inside the border with rhubarb curd., Top with the next layer and repeat the actions. Place the third layer on top and cover the entire cake with a thin layer of mascarpone cream also known as crumb coating. Place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Boil a small pot of water to use later. The water should be enough to cover 1 inch (2.5 cm of the pan).

Pour the mixture back into the egg whites. Continue to fold everything together until just smooth. Don’t overmix but also avoid leaving large pieces of egg white., Pour the batter into the lined cake pan. Drop the pan from 5” (12 cm) onto the table twice to release any extra large bubbles., Place the cake pan in the water bath pan and add an inch of hot water.

Do not open the oven to check until 1 hour has gone by., Run a knife along the edge of the pan to release the cake. Flip it on to a cooling rack. Let it cool completely before cutting and decorating., Prepare the macerated strawberries, While the cake cools, slice 8 oz (225 g) of strawberries into 1/4” (1/2 cm) slices and place them into a bowl. Sprinkle with the sugar and toss to coat well. Let them sit for at least an hour, up to 2 hours. Once the strawberries are glossy and sweet, remove them from the bowl and lay them out on a plate. Reserve the liquid left in the bowl., Combine the cake syrup ingredients in a small bowl and stir until the sugar is dissolved. (OPTIONAL) Add the reserved strawberry soaking liquid to the syrup; this adds extra strawberry flavor but will color the cake slices slightly pink., Prepare the cream, (Optional) IF MAKING STABILIZED CREAM (do not make ahead of time, it will set before decorating): Combine the gelatin and cold water in a small bowl. Let sit for 5 minutes.

Sift the confectioners sugar into the cream. Whip at medium speed until very soft peaks begin to form, then stop immediately. Add a large scoop of the whipped cream into the melted gelatin. Stir with a spoon until fully mixed and consistent. Drizzle the gelatin mixture into the mixing bowl with the cream. Continue to whip at medium speed briefly, until soft peaks are formed. DO NOT over-whip, it will begin to separate out the gelatin (which is still usable, but will be a bit blobby and unattractive)., IF MAKING REGULAR CREAM: Add the heavy cream into the mixing bowl of a stand mixer, or a bowl and use a hand mixer. Sift the confectioners sugar into the cream. Whip at medium speed until firm peaks begin to form., Assemble the cake, Once the cake has fully cooled, place it on a cutting board.

Add a little extra cream if needed., Once the cake is covered with a thin, even layer of cream, add another larger dollop to the cake. Spread a thicker layer of cream on top and then smooth out the sides., (Optional) If you have any cream left, add it to a piping bag or ziplock bag with the corner cut off for decorating the top and/or sides if desired., Decorate the cake with the remaining strawberries on top., If using stabilized cream, place the cake uncovered in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to let the cream set. If using unstabilized cream, serve immediately or refrigerate and serve within a few hours., To serve, you can slice the cake using a serrated knife once you transfer the cake from the fridge, if using unstabilized cream.

Mix until evenly combined and a pale yellow., Now you will want to fold the dry ingredients and milk into the wet ingredients alternating between dry ingredients and milk, ending with flour. What?? Here is an easier explanation: you will divide the four into thirds, it does not have to be exact, but just know you will add the flour three times. The milk will be divided into half, again it does not have to be precise but just know you will add the milk two times. To the wet ingredients (egg mixture) you will add one third of the flour, folding it in with a spatula. Then you will add one half of the milk, folding again with a spatula. Repeat and then add in your last third of flour. Folding means that instead of stirring you will lift the ingredients up from the bottom and fold it on top until it's combined evenly this helps create air in making a lighter batter., There you have it! It will be thick when you're done. Set this aside as you prepare the bottom of the pan (top of the cake)., Topping, You will need your cake pan, melting butter, brown sugar and your fruit. Make sure your fruit is rinsed, dried and sliced. I sliced my strawberries in half, but kept all my other berries whole., Pour the butter into the pan. Tilt the pan around so that the butter coats the entire cake pan., Sprinkle 1/2 of your brown sugar on the bottom of the pan., Add your fruit.

Mix on low speed to moisten the ingredients, then increase the speed to medium and beat for two minutes to develop the structure of the batter., Mix in the remainder of the milk just until smoothly combined., Divide the batter evenly among the three pans. If weighing, you should have about 17 oz of batter per cake pan. Smooth the top of the batter and bake until well risen, deeply golden brown and just barely starting to pull away from the sides of the pan. If you have an instant read thermometer, you're looking for an internal temperature of 195F-200F. This will take between 25-30 minutes, depending on your oven. Start checking at 20-22 minutes just to be safe., Remove to racks to cool for 15 minutes., Run a thin spatula around the inside of each cake pan and then turn the cakes out on cooling racks to cool completely., Optional: You can wrap each cake layer in plastic wrap as soon as you turn them out. This makes sure that all the moisture that would otherwise evaporate out of the cake stays inside. This will give you the moistest possible cake., For the Butterscotch Icing, Melt the butter over medium heat., Add the dark brown sugar and salt. Whisk constantly over medium-high heat until the butterscotch is smooth and boiling., Keep whisking. It will go through a phase where the butterscotch gets kind of sloppy looking. The butter will separate out and you will think something has Gone Wrong. Keep whisking and cooking., The butterscotch will come back together. When it comes back together, continue whisking until you see some smoke coming off the butterscotch and you smell a caramelized sugar smell., Carefully whisk in the cream, a bit at a time, until it's all in. The butterscotch will hiss and spit and may seize up. That's okay. continue whisking over medium-low heat until all of the butterscotch has melted back into to cream, and then cook, whisking frequently, until it reaches 237F., Remove from the heat and strain into a large pitcher or bowl., Allow to cool and thicken a bit for about 30 minutes before icing your cake., To Ice the Cake, When ready to ice your cake, place a rack over a rimmed baking sheet. Use a long serrated knife to slice off the domes from your cake layers. Save for snacking or to make butterscotch cake pops., Place one layer of cake on an 8"" cake board (or a piece of cardboard you cut to 8"" and wrap in foil) and put on the rack over the baking sheet., Pour or ladle on about 2/3 cup of icing and spread to the edge with an offset spatula., Add the second layer and repeat with another 2/3 cup of icing., Place the last layer, bottom side up, on top and press gently so all the layers adhere., Pour a generous amount of icing over the top of the cake, starting in the middle and then working out to the edges, allowing it to run down over the sides of the cake. Ideally you will get complete coverage doing this. If not, you can use an offset spatula to scoop up some excess from the tray and do any patching that is necessary. Do take care to cover the top completely and smoothly. The sides are not as important, especially once you slice it., Allow the cake and icing to sit at room temperature until completely cool (remember, your icing is still warm when you pour it), at least two hours., Use two large spatulas or a cake shovel to move the iced cake off the rack and onto your serving tray., Cake will stay fresh for 2-3 days before cutting. Once you slice it, store the cake, covered, at room temperature for 3-4 days.","[('granulated sugar', 10.5, 'oz'), ('dark brown sugar', 4.0, 'oz'), ('all purpose flour', 14.0, 'oz'), ('baking powder', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('fine sea salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('baking soda', 0.125, 'teaspoon'), ('unsalted butter', 6.0, 'oz'), ('whole milk', 10.0, 'oz'), ('large eggs', 4.0, None), ('vanilla extract', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('unsalted butter', 8.0, 'oz'), ('dark brown sugar', 16.0, 'oz'), ('fine sea salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('heavy cream', 20.0, 'oz')]"

Make sure your 10 inch angel food tube pan is totally clean. Do not grease or line it in any way. When the oven is preheated, lay your pecans on a baking sheet in a single layer and toast them in the oven for about 10 minutes until toasted and fragrant. Remove from the oven and set aside., When you separate your egg yolks and egg whites, please note, that if your egg yolk breaks and makes it into your whites - they will not whip up properly and the cake will not turn out. For this reason, I suggest separating each egg over a small bowl then transferring it to separate yolks and whites bowls. If your egg yolk happens to break and leak - do not use it. Reserve it for an omelet or another use. Measuring the flour correctly is very important. Spoon the flour into the cup measure and shave off the excess flour with a butter knife without compressing it into the cup measure. Flour is very compactable, so if you simply scoop it out of the bag and not spoon it in, you will end up getting a lot more flour than needed and turning this delicate cake into a dense one. So do not skip this extra step., Sift flour, baking powder and salt into a small bowl. In another bowl, whisk the liquid components together., Beat egg whites with a whisk attachment of your stand mixer on medium-high speed until frothy, about 2 minutes. Add cream of tartar and continue whipping until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Gradually add the sugar with the mixer running on medium speed. It’s crucial to add the sugar slowly for the meringue to properly form, do so for a period of about 2 minutes. Beat until you reach stiff glossy peaks, around 4 minutes. Do not overbeat. When this is overbeat, your meringue won't be smooth. Transfer your meringue to another bowl and set aside., No need to wash the bowl of your mixer after step 4, simply wipe it with a paper towel. Add egg yolks and beat them until thickened, for about 2 minutes. Gradually add sugar on high speed. Beat for another 2 minutes until lighter in colour and thickened. On medium speed, pour in the oil. Then add vanilla and lemon zest. Stop the mixer, scrape up the sides, then beat everything for another 1 minute to combine., Add the dry ingredients with the mixer running on lowest speed, alternating with the liquids, dividing the flour into 3 parts and the liquid into 2 parts, starting and ending with the flour. Scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula. Then beat everything on low speed for 10 seconds., Gently fold 1/3 of the whipped egg whites into the egg yolks with a whisk this will lighten the batter and make it easier to fold in the rest. Fold in the rest of the egg whites, as well as cooled toasted pecans, into the yolk mixture with a rubber spatula. Only fold until uniform in colour and combined; do not fold any more than necessary. Pour the batter into the ungreased tube pan., Bake in preheated oven for about 55-60 minutes. The cake should be nice and golden, firm to touch and spring back when gently pressed in the centre. Look for the internal temperature of 206 measured with an instant read digital thermometer. Remove from the oven. If your pan has legs, open them up and place the cake upside down to cook (this will take about 2 hours.) If your pan doesn't have legs, find 3 cans (beans, tomatoes, whatever) and prop up the pan upside down over the cans., Icing:, Place all of the icing ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer and whip. When the icing is thickened but does not yet hold stiff peaks, taste it. If you wish, add more sugar at this point. Continue whipping for about 4 minutes to stiff peaks (but stop beating as soon as stiff peaks are reached as you are not making butter here!), Cake assembly:, Gently run a butter knife between the cake and the pan. Using an offset spatula gently try to loosen the cake from the bottom as well. Gently remove the cake from the pan. Slice your cake horizontally into 3 layers. Ice each layer with 25% of the icing. You are looking to make the icing layer 1/2-3/4"" inch thick. You should have icing left for garnish. If using 1/2 cup chopped pecans, sprinkle 1/4 cup over the first layer and 1/4 cup over the second layer. Ice the top and sides of the cake with leftover icing and garnish with whole pecans. Sprinkle shredded coconut, if desired., Drizzle the cake with he butterscotch sauce. Be sure to also drizzle each individual slice with some additional butterscotch sauce, or serve some butterscotch sauce on the side with each slice. Refrigerate the cake for 4 hours. But no more than 8 hours. The leftovers will still store in the fridge for a couple of days, however, the best texture is when the cake is refrigerated between 4 and 8 hours., For the butterscoth sauce:, Your sauce will foam and bubble up quite a bit, so be sure to use a medium pan and not a small one. Add butter and sugar and heat on medium heat, swirling the pan and infrequently stirring the sauce with a rubber spatula, around 3 minutes. The sauce should become quite smooth and fluid and no longer look grainy. In other words, you are looking to ensure the sugar has dissolved. Add cream and reduce the heat to medium low. Stir constantly with a heat resistant spatula and cook for 7-8 minutes until the temperate of the caramel reaches 225. After a minute of cooking, turn your heat up back to medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla and heaping 3/4 teaspoon coarse salt. Allow to cool for about 5 minutes as the sauce will be extremely hot. Taste it and see if you wish to add a bit more salt. Salt brings an interesting dimension to this sauce, so don't be afraid to add more. If this sauce separates, warm it up in a sauce pan and whisk until smooth.","[('pecans', 0.5, 'cup'), ('egg whites', 7, None), ('cream of tartar', 1, 'tsp'), ('sugar', 1, 'cup'), ('cake flour', 2, 'cups'), ('baking powder', 1, 'tbsp'), ('salt', 0.75, 'tsp'), ('lemon juice', 0.5, 'cup'), ('water', 2, 'tbsp'), ('egg yolks', 7, None), ('sugar', 1, 'cup'), ('oil', 0.5, 'cup'), ('vanilla', 2, 'tsp'), ('lemons', 3, None), ('whipping cream', 4, 'cups'), ('granulated sugar', 6, 'tbsp'), ('vanilla', 2, 'tsp'), ('salt', None, None), ('butter', 0.5, 'cup'), ('dark brown sugar', 1, 'cup'), ('whipping cream', 1, 'cup'), ('vanilla', 1, 'tsp'), ('fleur de sel', 0.75, 'tsp'), ('pecans', None, None)]"

(The image below shows only one sheet of cake sponge, repeat the same frosting steps with the second sheet)., This is a tricky and very important step. Start rolling the first strip like you would roll a regular cake roll. Firmly roll the sponge while at the same time focusing on preventing the cake sponges from breaking. Add the next strip by lining it up the short sides next to each other as soon after the previous one ends., Use the parchment paper for stability to help hold the roll together during the rolling process so that it does not unroll.

Place all ingredients into a food process or blender and pulse until smooth (but not too fine)., 2 Knead flour: In a bowl combine flour, salt, sugar and baking powder. Gradually add water and knead to form a soft, smooth dough. The key to a soft dough is not folding over the flour too often (once all the water has been added, just press gently with the knuckles to smoothen, turn over, repeat). Cover with a kitchen towel and allow it to rest for a minimum of 20 mins., 3 Clean and rinse shrimp with cold water and the juice of a lemon; removing shells and other undesirables. Drain and place in a bowl. I usually buy pre-cleaned shrimp to save on time., 4 Season shrimp with green seasoning(pre made), salt, black pepper, all-purpose seasoning and adobo, if using. Marinate for a minimum of 30 mins or overnight covered in the refrigerator., 5 Cook Shrimp: When ready to cook, remove the seasoned shrimp from the refrigerator and bring to room temp. Heat oil in a frying pan over high heat. Add chopped onion and hot pepper(this step is optional and ingredients are not listed) and place the shrimp in the hot oil. Cook until golden brown on both sides. Should take 3-4 mins per side on medium heat., 6 Mince Filling: Once the shrimp is cool, place 3/4 in the bowl of a food processor and pulse several times to coarsely chop. Alternately, you can chop the shrimp by hand using a chopper or sharp knife. Return the shrimp back to the bowl with the whole shrimp, add additional green seasoning if desired and mix well to combine., 7 Make Balls(loyahs)- Using your hand, squeeze off pieces of flour between thumb and forefinger to make 12 small balls. (I make three large loyahs(balls) and then divide each into 4). This way you don’t have to reshape after separating the dough., 8 Fill Dough: Lightly flour surface. Using your fingers, flatten each ball into a 5-6 inch disc. Place a handful of the shrimp mixture (about 3 heaping tablespoons) onto one half and fold with the other half to create a semi-circle. Pinch the edges together to seal all the way around, then twist all around to seal. Place the completed filled dough on a floured surface and cover with a kitchen or paper towel until ready to fry. Quickly repeat the steps with the remaining balls of dough., 9 To fry: Once all the dough are filled—or several, heat about 3 cups of oil (use more if your pot is wider) in a wide Dutch oven or heavy bottomed pot. Add a small pinch of dough. The oil is ready when it floats and darkens., 10 Gently place filled dough into the hot oil, two or three at a time if the pot is large enough. Using a spoon, continuously pour hot oil over the dough. When the bottom is golden brown, flip and cook the other side until golden brown as well.

After about five minutes has elapsed, gently add the butter chunks and continue to stir until melted and slightly thickened, about another 7 minutes. You will want to whisk this constantly so the eggs do not “cook.” Remove from heat and immediately strain to remove any tiny lumps and ensure a smooth finish. Cool completely in the refrigerator until thick, covering top of the curd to prevent a skin from forming. This should be about two to three hours, or you can speed the process up in the freezer. This curd will be the base for your filling., FOR THE CRUST:Preheat the oven to 350°. You will be using a 9” pie pan for the recipe.

Slowly add the butter cube by cube, and mix on low until it forms a wet-sand-like consistency. Alternatively you can use a pastry cutter and cut the butter into the flour + sugar mixture. Add the salt, mix. Add the cold water one tablespoon at a time. Dough is ready when it is firm and not sticky. Press dough into the pie pan, and blind bake by lining with parchment paper and filling the crust with pie weighs, dry beans, or rice. Bake at 350° for 20-25 minutes or until crust is slightly golden and cooked through. Allowed to cool completely before filling., THE TOPPINGS:Whip your two cups of cream until soft peaks form. Divide the whipped cream in half. Fold half of the unsweetened whipped cream into the lemon curd gently until fully combined and creamy in color. Set this aside. Mix your sour cream and sugar in a small bowl. Set this aside. To the remaining whipped cream, add the 1/4 cup of sugar. Mix gently until incorporated. You are now ready to assemble!, ASSEMBLING THE PIE: Pour the creamy lemon pie filling into your cooled crust, and spoon it around until it’s evenly disturbed inside the crust. Pour the sour cream topping over the lemon filling, and gently smooth out close to the edges. Pipe or spread the remaining whipped cream on top of the sour cream layer, and garnish with lemon rind, dried lemons, or greenery. Serve immediately.

Cool to room temperature then finely chop or pulse in food processor., Preheat oven to 350˚F. Line the bottoms of two 9"" baking pans with parchment paper (do not grease the pan).

It will thicken more as it cools., Beat softened butter in a mixer with whisk attachment for 5 minutes on high speed until white and fluffy, scraping down the bowl as needed. Add room temp custard mixture 1 heaping Tablespoon at a time, beating on high speed for a few seconds with each addition. Once all of the custard is incorporated, scrape down the bowl and beat another 2 minutes on high speed. Reserve 1 cup of cream and set aside (you'll use this to coat the top and sides of cake). Fold in 1/4 of your toasted cooled nuts into remaining big batch of cream., Assembling the Walnut Cake:, Line the edges of a cake platter with strips of parchment paper (this will make cleanup easier). Place first cake layer on the platter and spoon half of the syrup evenly over the top. Top with all of your walnut buttercream and spread evenly. Add the next cake layer and spoon the remaining syrup over the top. Coat the sides and top of the cake evenly with remaining 1 cup of buttercream., Apply the remaining finely chopped walnuts to the sides of the cake only, scooping it on with your hand and gently pressing for the nuts to adhere to the frosting. Now make your ganache (see below). Once ganache has rested 5-10 minutes, spread it evenly over the top of the cake, allowing some of it to drip down the sides of the cake. Let cake rest until ganache is set (you can refrigerate 30 min if desired)., How to Make Chocolate Ganache:, Place 1/4 lb of chocolate chips in a heat-proof bowl. Pour 1/2 cup heavy cream into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. When it's just at a uniform simmer, pour over the chocolate chips ensuring chocolate is fully submerged in cream. Cover bowl with lid and let sit at room temp 15 min then whisk until a silky chocolate sauce forms.

You can start by separating 5 eggs. (If you want the cake to be even fluffier or taller, you can use 6 eggs.) Place the egg yolks in a bowl, and the egg whites in a mixer bowl., Place the butter, cream cheese and 1/4 cup of fine sugar into a pot over low-heat. Allow the ingredients to melt, and mix together into a beautifully smooth batter mixture., Remove the pot from heat, and add the egg yolks into the batter mixture. Mix well, but gently., Add the cornstarch and flour. Once again, mix well. Clumps should disappear., Add the milk and optionally add vanilla extract or other flavors of your choice., Mix well. The batter should be smooth and liquid-y. This is not a thick cake batter and it’s okay! Add 1 teaspoon of ube extract. Mix well again. You won’t have to strain this mixture. (See video) If you want pandan flavor, you can addd 1 teaspoon of pandan extract instead of the ube extract., Set aside the cake batter as you beat the egg whites into stiff peaks (see below for egg beating tips). Egg white meringue requires the 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 tsp cream of tartar. Please scroll below to see proper egg white beating steps. Properly beating egg whites into stiff peaks requires at least 8-10 minutes., Pre-heat your oven to 330F. Depending on your oven, you may want to either lower the temperature to 325 or raise to 340F. Prepare a bain-marie by putting water in a deep rectangular baking pan or dish. Place into the oven., Prepare baking pans— with these ingredients, you can bake one 8-inch cake or two 6-inch cakes. Line the bottoms of the baking pans with circular parchment paper, and the inside sides with rectangular strips of parchment paper. (Not wax paper.), Once you achieve stiff peaks, place some beaten egg white into the batter and mix together., Repeat the above step two more times., You don’t want to over mix the batter. Pour the batter into the rest of the egg whites and mix together using folding techniques. You don’t want to over-mix or under mix. If you over mix, the cake will not rise. If you under-mix, your cake will be uneven. The egg white will float to the top and you’ll have meringue-like cake at the top, and a dense cheesecake at the bottom., Pour the well incorporated, but not over-mixed batter into the baking pan(s)., Bake bain-marie style for 25 minutes 330F (Depending on your oven, you may have to adjust the temperature.) If you see the cake is not rising at all, this temperature may be too low. Raise the temperature by 10 degrees. If your cake rises meteorically, then you may have under-mixed your final batter, and your cake top will likely crack., After 25 minutes, your cake should rise. If it has not risen yet, allow it to stay at the same temperature and give it time to rise. Once it rises nicely, crack open the oven door slightly and keep it opened for 10 seconds (approximately). Lower the oven temperature to about 245-265F, depending on your oven and bake for an additional 45 minutes., Allow your cake to rest in the oven after baking for about 10 minutes., Remove from the oven. Be careful and use oven mitts as needed. Place a sheet of parchment paper over the cake. Place a plate over the cake and parchment paper. Flip the cake upside down so the top of it is now the bottom, while resting on the parchment paper over the plate. Remove the cake from the pan by sliding it out, or gently shaking it out., Remove the wet parchment paper from the cake, replace the bottom parchment paper of the cake., Now place another plate— the presentation or serving plate, on top of the cake. It should be on top of the bottom of the cake. Flip the cake again, carefully., Play with the bouncy jiggly-ness of the cake. Serve when still warm, or chill in the fridge.

Click on the “Metric“ button at the top of the recipe to convert the ingredient measurements to metric. If you‘re using a cup measurement, please follow the “fluff and sprinkle“ method: Fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle the flour into your measuring cup, and level it off. Otherwise, you may scoop more flour than you need., Gather all the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 320ºF (160ºC). For a convection oven, reduce the oven temperature by 25ºF (15ºC) to 295ºF (145ºC)., Cut the parchment paper to fit the baking pans (see the video for this process). You will need two loaf pans (8½ x 4½ x 2¾ inches, or 22 x 11 x 7 cm). If your pans are smaller, add the excess batter to another smaller pan and use a shorter bake time., To Make the Batter, Sift 1⅔ cup bread flour twice with either a sifter or fine-meshed strainer. Holding the handle of the strainer with one hand and tapping it gently with the other, the flour will gradually sift through the strainer. Tip: Bread flour gives the cake an elastic, bouncy texture that you cannot achieve with all-purpose flour., Add 2½ Tbsp water to ⅓ cup honey (5 Tbsp + 1 tsp) and whisk well., Fit a stand mixer with the whisk attachment. Crack 6 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) into the bowl of the mixer and vigorously whisk until combined., Add 1 cup sugar., Beat the eggs and sugar on high speed (Speed 10) for 5 minutes. If you beat the eggs with a handheld mixer, it will take more time. The beaten eggs will quadruple in volume. The texture will be thick and the color will be pale yellow. When you stop the mixer and lift the whisk attachment, the mixture should fall in ribbons., Add the honey mixture into the egg mixture and whisk on low speed (Speed 2) until combined, about 30 seconds., Add the bread flour in three parts. Add one-third of the bread flour and whisk at low speed (Speed 2) for 15 seconds. Then, add another third and whisk for another 15 seconds. Finally, add the last remaining portion and whisk until just combined for about 1 minute. Do not overmix., To Bake, Spray the loaf pans with oil and distribute it evenly with a pastry brush., Put the parchment paper in the pans and make sure the paper sticks to the pans. If is does not, apply more oil to the pan, spread it evenly with a brush, and place the parchment paper again., Pour the batter into the pans about 80% full., Using a skewer, draw a zigzag line through the batter to remove the air bubbles in the batter., Level the batter by holding each pan 2 inches above the counter and dropping it flat onto the counter. Do this several times to release the air bubbles., Bake at 320ºF (160ºC) in the middle rack of the oven for 35 to 40 minutes (I bake my cakes for 35 minutes), or until golden brown and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Turn off the oven, at which point I open and leave my oven door ajar for a few minutes. Then, I take out the cakes. When done, the cake sides will pull away from the pan slightly; the top will be flat and feel spongy when pressed with a finger., To Apply the Syrup and Chill Overnight, To make the honey syrup, mix 1 Tbsp honey and ½ Tbsp water in a bowl. Immediately apply the honey syrup over the tops of the hot cakes with a pastry brush., For each cake, place a sheet of plastic wrap on the countertop. Take out the hot cakes from the pan and place them top down on the plastic wrap. Gently peel off the parchment paper., Immediately wrap the cakes with the plastic film to retain moisture. Bring the cake to room temperature. Then, put the wrapped cakes in the refrigerator and store them overnight (or at least 12 hours), keeping the top side facing down. This will help the cakes develop a fine and moist texture., To Serve, Remove the cake from the refrigerator. Bring the cake to room temperature. Slice off the four sides of the cake with a sharp bread knife. Then, cut the cake into ¾- to 1-inch-thick slices (you will get 7–8 slices total). Serve it with tea or coffee, if you‘d like., To Store, To save for later, wrap individual pieces with plastic wrap.

If you use more than one egg, you’ll need to double, triple or quadruple the quantities of baking powder, kefir, rose syrup, raspberries and cream accordingly., Butter and line your baking tins, or use silicone moulds. The size will depend on how many eggs you’re using. For a one egg cake, two round 10 cm moulds or tins work well., Place the verbena leaves on the bottom of the tins., Cream the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy., Beat in the egg. If it curdles, just work in a bit of the flour and it should come together., Sieve in the flour and baking powder, throwing any bran left in the sieve into the compost bin. You don’t have to do this, but its quite nice to not have any large bit in a light cake I find., Stir until just combined, then stir in the kefir, buttermilk or sour milk. Divide the mixture between the two tins and spoon the top of the verbena leaves., Bake at 180℃ (350℉, Gas 4) for 15 minutes for this one egg cake or until risen, golden and firm to the touch. For a two egg cake, bake for 20-25 minutes, a three egg cake, 30-35 minutes and a 4 egg cake 40-45 minutes. Leave in the tins to cool for a few minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. At this point you can peel off the scented leaves., Crush the raspberries in a bowl with the back of a fork. Stir in 1 tsp of the rose syrup., Whip the cream with the other tsp of rose syrup until soft peaks form., If the sponges are too domed, level one of them off with a knife so it sits flat on a plate. Spoon on the crushed raspberries, followed by the cream. Place the remaining sponge on top and dust with icing sugar.","[('egg', 1.0, None), ('butter', 50.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 50.0, 'g'), ('flour', 50.0, 'g'), ('baking powder', 0.33, 'tsp'), ('kefir', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('lemon verbena leaves', 1.0, None), ('raspberries', 75.0, 'g'), ('cream', 75.0, 'ml'), ('rose syrup', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('icing sugar', 1.0, None)]"

Blend the coriander with 50ml water and 60ml coconut milk for 30 seconds and blitz it to a pulp., Cake Batter, Separate the yolks from the whites and let sit for 30 minutes @ room temperature., In a separate bowl, lightly hand whisk the egg yolks.

Gradually add the 50g sugar as you whisk. Once the sugar is added, switch to HIGH and whisk until stiff peaks. You get stiff peaks when the meringue firmly holds its shape on the whisk., Gently whisk in 1/3 of the meringue into the coriander batter. Once it’s well mixed, switching to a spatula - gently incorporate this into the remaining meringue until it’s well combined., Pour the batter into a 6 inch tube pan. Note: DO NOT grease the tube pan. The cake needs to cling to the pan to rise., Once the batter is poured in, tap the pan firmly on the work table a couple of times to even out the batter and to release any large air bubbles. Just in case, I also like to use a wooden skewer to run through the batter a few times to get rid of bubbles., Pop the pan into the oven and bake at the lowest rack @165C for 30 minutes.

Do not remove the cake from the pan until it is completely cool.

Be sure to squeeze out all the concentrated tea from the tea bags afterwards. You want to still have 1/2 cup of liquid., Remove the tea leaves from 6 tea bags They should be in powder form, but if not, blend until it become a powder. There should be about 2 tbsp of powdered tea leaves., Crack 8 eggs in a bowl and separate the yolks from the whites., In your stand mixer bowl, add the flour, concentrated tea water, oil, sugar, and egg yolks together then mix over high speed for 15 minutes. I started at speed 6 for 1 minutes then raised it up to 10 for the remaining time. IT should become more airy and have doubled in volume., Place the egg yolk mixture in another bowl then add the egg whites and baking powder into the stand mixer bowl.

Make sure the oven has already been pre-heated, otherwise the batter will start to deflate., Rest upside down for 20 minutes before cutting. This helps retain its puffy shape., Earl Grey Custard, In a sauce pan, add the milk and cream then heat up over low heat while stirring until it reaches 175F. One way to tell is when it starts to steam but isn't boiling yet., Turn off the heat, add 4 tea bags, cover and allow to steep at least 10 minutes., Squeeze out all the excess milk before discarding the tea bags., In a bowl, mix together egg yolks and sugar then slowly stream in the warm milk 1 ladle at a time while mixing.

After it has cooled down, remove tea bags or drain the tea leaves and measure out only 120ml of earl grey tea and set aside., This is an optional step, for those who would like to add crushed tea leaves into your batter. I use tea bags and usually just crush them directly. If you wish to have a finer texture, you may also grind it with a food processor, or use the mortar and pestle to crush. You may wish to omit the crushed tea leaves, but they do add to the strength of the earl grey flavour and I'd highly recommend it., Preheat oven to 170°C. Sift flour and baking powder, set aside., Separate your eggs, placing the whites in one clean and dry large bowl, and the yolks in another clean bowl., Egg Yolk Batter, Using either a whisk to beat manually by hand, or flat beater on your stand mixer, combine egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and beat until mixture becomes light and colour turns pale., Add oil, infused earl grey tea water, and crushed tea leaves and whisk until well combined. If using an electronic mixer, use the slowest speed setting., Add flour gradually in 4-5 folds, and mix until batter is well incorporated without any lumps. Set aside., Egg White Meringue, Using a stand mixer with balloon whisk attachment, beat egg whites on medium low speed until foamy then add in cream of tartar., When the mixture starts to get bubbly, add half portion of sugar and beat on high speed for 2-3 minutes. Reduce speed to medium-high then add remaining sugar gradually and beat until egg whites are glossy, with stiff peaks. When you lift your whisk, your egg white meringue would stand straight up with the tip slightly bent over. Also be sure to check the bottom of the bowl to ensure that there is no liquidy mixture - this is considered under-beating. Note that under-beating or over-beating the meringue mixture would cause the cake to either not rise, or it would rise and collapse., Fold In, Using a spatula, add ⅓ of meringue into egg yolk mixture and fold in lightly. You'd want to be as gentle as you can so as to ensure you do not deflate the egg whites too much., Add in another ⅓ of the meringue and fold - again, remember to be gentle. This is to ensure you'd achieve a fluffy cake., Finally add the remaining meringue and fold to incorporate completely. If your meringue is not completely homogenous with your egg yolk mixture, when the cake is baked, you would find white streaks., Pour batter into a 22cm/9"" chiffon cake tube pan. The best chiffon cake pan to use is the aluminium pan with removable base. The non-stick ones are not suitable and DO NOT grease your chiffon cake pan., Knock the cake pan lightly on the tabletop to remove air pockets. If you skip this step, you may find holes within your cake after baking., Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. When cake is done, remove from oven and invert it on a wire rack, leaving it to cool. Please make sure the cake is left upside down until completely cool or the cake will collapse., Once cake has cooled completely, carefully run a palette knife or spatula around the sides of the cake to loosen it before inverting onto a cake board or serving plate.

Use either two 6-inch cake pans or an 8-inch one. Line the cake pan(s) with parchment paper (NOT WAX PAPER), rim and bottom. Separate 6 eggs. Place the egg yolks in a bowl, and the egg whites in a mixer bowl. Prepare a bain-marie by putting water in a deep rectangular baking pan or dish., Place the butter, cream cheese into a pot over low-heat. Allow the ingredients to melt, and mix together into a beautifully smooth batter mixture. Add 1/4 cup granulated sugar and mix together., Remove the pot from heat, and add the egg yolks into the batter mixture. Mix well, but gently. Heat the milk in microwave and mix together with the black sesame powder., Add the cornstarch and flour into the powder. Once again, mix well. Clumps should disappear. Add the black sesame milk mixture. Mix well. The batter should be smooth and liquid-y. You do not have to strain this mixture. (See video) The beaten egg white will thicken the batter., Set aside the batter as you beat the egg whites into glossy stiff peaks that don't move or budge (see video). Beating eggs is a slow gradual process. Add cream of tartar after you see some foam, and add sugar after the egg whites become foamier and whiter. Once you achieve stiff peaks, place some beaten egg white into the batter and mix together., Repeat the above step two to three more times., You don’t want to over mix the batter. Pour the batter into the rest of the egg whites and mix together using folding techniques. You don’t want to over-mix or under mix. If you over mix, the cake will not rise. If you under-mix, your cake will be uneven. The egg white will float to the top and you’ll have meringue-like cake at the top, and a dense cheesecake at the bottom., Pour the well incorporated, but not over-mixed batter into the baking pan(s)., Bake bain-marie style for 25 minutes 325-340F (Depending on your oven, you may have to adjust the temperature.) After 25 minutes, your cake should rise. (My cakes rise by 10-12 minutes.) If it has not risen yet, allow it to stay at the same temperature and give it time to rise, or you might have to raise the temperature if it doesn't rise at all, or unfortunately you may have over-mixed your final batter, or your egg whites were not beaten to stiff peaks. Once the cake rises nicely, crack open the oven door slightly and keep it opened for 10 seconds (approximately). Lower the oven temperature to about 245-265F, depending on your oven and bake for an additional 45 minutes. If your cake top is cracking, the temperature is too high. If the cake is not browning, temperature is too low, or the parchment paper around the rims is too high. If your cake is still wet after 45 min, keep the cake in the oven for. longer., Allow your cake to rest after baking for about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven. Be careful and use oven mitts as needed. Place a sheet of parchment paper over the cake. Place a plate over the cake and parchment paper. Flip the cake upside down so the top of it is now the bottom, while resting on the parchment paper over the plate. Remove the cake from the pan by sliding it out, or gently shaking it out., Remove the wet parchment paper from the cake, replace the bottom parchment paper of the cake.

Place a piece of greaseproof paper (approx. 40cm) on top. This will be used to wrap your Roly Poly for baking., Sift your flour into a large bowl, before adding the butter/margarine. Rub the butter/margarine into the flour with your finger tips, to create a breadcrumb-like consistency. Add the sugar and stir-through to combine., Add the shredded suet and mix through, before gradually adding the milk, stirring through until you have a soft, slightly sticky dough - you may not need to use all the milk., Tip the suet pastry dough onto a well-floured surface and gently knead for a couple of minutes to bring the dough together.

Trim the edges if necessary., Spread the jam over your square of dough, leaving a 1-2cm gap on one edge (the furthest away to you edge is best, as it will make it easier when it comes to rolling). To roll your Jam Roly Poly, take the edge opposite the gap and start to roll it towards the gap - initially it will be more of a folding action, as opposed to a roll. Continue to roll until you reach the other end. Brush your gap with a little excess milk before rolling right over to seal your Roly Poly., Bring your prepared tin foil and greaseproof paper to your now-rolled Roly Poly. Gently lift your Roly Poly onto the greaseproof paper - using a large palette knife can make this easier. Pull the greaseproof paper and tin foil around your Roly Poly and fold the tin foil to seal the edges. You want to create a sealed parcel around your Roly Poly, but leave lots of space around it inside, to allow it to rise as it bakes., Place your Jam Roly Poly parcel onto a tray and bake in your pre-heated oven for 50 minutes - 1 hour.

Place your butter into a stand mixer (or use an electric hand mixer) and mix on a medium speed for about 3-5 minutes until the butter has gone a lot more pale in colour., Add your icing sugar gradually. I add it in 2-3 stages and beat for about 3 minutes between each addition. Start your mixer slowly to save your kitchen from a real icing sugar mess, but then increase the speed to medium / high for each of your 3 minutes., Add your lemon juice and zest and mix once more. It should now be done. Ensure it's the right thickness - it should be if you've beaten it for long enough. However, if it's too thick you can add a tiny amount of milk. And if too thin, sieve in a little extra icing sugar., For assemble:, Carefully place one of your sponges onto your serving plate and spread a layer of the lemon buttercream of top all the way to the edges., Then spread a layer of lemon curd on top, not quite to the edges as once its sandwiched it will spread further., Carefully place the top layer on and spread with the top with more lemon buttercream., Sprinkle the top with extra lemon zest to finish.","[('butter', 225.0, 'g'), ('caster sugar', 225.0, 'g'), ('eggs', 4.0, None), ('lemons', 3.0, None), ('lemon juice', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('self raising flour', 225.0, 'g'), ('baking powder', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('xanthan gum', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('butter', 225.0, 'g'), ('icing sugar', 450.0, 'g'), ('lemons', 2.0, None), ('lemon juice', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('lemon curd', 1.0, None)]"

Blanch them in boiling water for 1-2 minutes then strain. Transfer the peas into a bowl and use a hand blender to blitz until smooth. If you have a food processor or better blender, feel free to use that instead as you’ll probably get better smoother results. Once the peas are smooth, set aside., For the rest of the cake, melt 200 grams of butter. Pour that into a bowl and add in 150 grams of sugar and 2 teaspoons of vanilla, then whisk to combine. To that add 3 whole eggs. And whisk again. Then, whisk in the pea puree., In a separate bowl, measure in 250 grams of all purpose flour. 2 tsp of baking powder and a pinch of salt. Stir this together then add to the wet ingredients and mix until smooth and combined., To microwave. Coat the inside of a disposable coffee cup with non stick spray. Stab a few holes in the bottom of the cup. Fill the cup half way with batter, then microwave for 1-2 minutes. The timing depends on your microwave so consider your first cup of batter a bit of a test run. Once cooked, place the cup upside down on a plate for a couple of minutes to set, then, tear up the cake and serve., This recipe doesn’t require a whipping siphon and would be too thick to use one anyway but because of this the finished microwave sponge isn’t as aerated., Also, the thing about microwave cakes in general, I know they’re cool and it’s a neat technique but I’ve never had one that tastes as good as traditional cake. It’s always a bit eggy tasting and dries out really fast so I tend not to do them for service at all anymore. Instead, I just use this same batter, though instead of melting the butter I just cream it with the sugar, and bake it at 325F 160 C for about 35 minutes. While the colour isn’t as vibrant as the microwave sponge and it takes a little longer, the flavour is much better.","[('butter', 200.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 150.0, 'g'), ('vanilla', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('pea puree', 275.0, 'g'), ('all purpose flour', 250.0, 'g'), ('baking powder', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('salt', 1.0, 'pinch')]"

The cake needs to cling to the side of the pan to rise tall, Get the eggs out of the fridge and separate them when they are still cold. They are easier to separate when they are cold. Let the yolks and the whites come to a room temperature, this may take about 30 minutes or so, Prepare the cake batter:, Preheat your oven to 330 F (165 C) for conventional oven. If you have a convection oven, I suggest lowering the temperature by 25 F (15 C). Place the oven rack 4th from the top (or adjust accordingly, you will know your oven best), Place the egg whites in a clean mixing bowl. I use a stand mixer with a whisk attachment. You will have trouble whipping your meringue if there's a trace of grease in your utensils or bowls, In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks, sugar, creamed corn, and oil. Sift in the cake flour and salt into the batter. Whisk to mix into a smooth batter. Set aside, Whipping the meringue:, Beat the egg whites on medium speed until frothy, add cream of tartar or lemon juice/vinegar and whip until it turns whitish and air bubbles are fine. Gradually add the sugar as you beat, in 3 batches. I beat them at medium speed (speed 6 on Kitchen Aid). This will take a bit longer compared to beating at high speed. I used to do higher speed (speed 8), but the meringue is smoother and nicer when I maintain the speed on 6 and much more stable too. I highly recommend stopping several times to check on the consistency and scraping the sides of the bowl to make sure no sugar left on the side of the bowl. Whip until you reach a stiff peak but still have a slight bent on the tip. Then lower the speed to 4 and whip for 1 minute to even out large bubbles and stop beating, Fold meringue into the cake batter:, Gently fold 1/3 of the meringue into the thick batter. Using a whisk, using a cutting motion and fold over to mix. Repeat this motion several rounds. Continue on with the second 1/3 of the meringue again to mix. For the last 1/3 of the meringue, use a rubber spatula instead to ensure you get all the batter at the bottom of the bowl mixed in as well. Use a cut down in the middle and fold over motion to fold gently but quickly. Make sure you don't see any more white meringue. The mixture should be fluffy and voluminous., Pour the batter into an UNGREASED chiffon cake pan. Use a rubber spatula to smooth the surface. Gently drop the cake pan from about 10 cm height on the counter 2-3 times. Use a skewer to draw a zig zag to pop bubbles inside the cake batter, Baking:, Put the chiffon pan in the middle rack and let it bake for 50-55 minutes for 8-inch chiffon cake and 40-45 minutes for 6-inch chiffon cake. The time is just for a reference. Your oven may need less or more time to bake, Test for doneness:, I know this is weird to say, but it's actually ""safer"" to overbake chiffon cake than underbaking. Underbaking tends to cause the cake to collapse. Usually if you insert a skewer inside the cake and no crumbs stick to it or very minimal crumbs, it is safe to say that the cake is cooked through. You can also touch the top and if it springs back, it's a good sign that it's cooked through. I like to have some golden brown on top. I don't know if you notice, but when the cake has a golden brown color on top, it's actually more flavorful too than when the cake is pale in color, Don't be alarmed if your cake has some cracks on top. What you are looking at will become the bottom of your cake. I know many people mind it a lot and make a big fuss when the top of the chiffon cake cracks, but actually it's not a flaw., Cooling:, Drop the cake pan from about 10 cm height on the counter several times to prevent shrinkage when you pull the cake out of the oven. Then carefully invert the pan upside down immediately. Please don't be tempted to remove it from the pan if it's still warm. It takes about one to two hours to cool down completely, Once it's cool down completely, use a spatula knife to run through the edge and the outer center of the tube to help release the cake. Gently push the base to lift the cake out. Use the knife again to run through the base of the pan and then carefully release the cake., I suggest that you wait for 24 hours before serving the cake (if you can wait). The flavor always gets better the next day compared to when you serve it on the same day, How to store:, Let the cake cool down completely.
