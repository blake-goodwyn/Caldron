Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or an electric hand mixer, beat the butter, both sugars and vanilla on medium-high till it’s super light and fluffy (3 to 5 minutes for a stand mixer; 6 to 8 for a hand mixer). Using a spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl and, with the mixer on low, slowly add the flour, followed by the chocolate chunks, and mix just to blend. If necessary, knead the dough with your hands to make sure the flour is totally incorporated. At this point, the dough should be smooth and feel like Play-Doh with no pockets of flour., Divide the dough in half, placing each half on a large piece of plastic wrap. Fold the plastic over so that it covers the dough to protect your hands from getting all sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a log shape; rolling it on the counter will help you smooth it out, but don’t worry about getting it totally perfect. (Don't be afraid to make them compact. Shortbread is supposed to be dense. That's part of why it's so good.) You can also do this using parchment paper, if you prefer, but plastic wrap is easier when it comes to shaping the log. Each half should form a 6-inch log, 2 to 2¼ inches in diameter. Chill until totally firm, about 2 hours., Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Brush the outside of the logs with the beaten egg and roll them in the demerara sugar (this is for those really delicious, crisp edges)., Using a serrated knife, carefully slice each log into ½-inch-thick rounds (if you hit a chocolate chunk, slowly saw back and forth through the chocolate). If the cookies break or fall apart, just press them back together — the dough is very forgiving. Place them on the prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart (they won’t spread much).

Divide dough into two or three balls, pat them into discs, and wrap each in plastic wrap. Chill the dough in the fridge for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days., Heat oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Roll out a disc of dough to about 1/8- or 1/4-inch thick, depending on your preference. Unlike pie crusts, which I generally roll out between sheets of parchment, I found this to be easiest on a well-floured surface, sprinkling flour over the top and lifting the bottom to re-flour as needed. (The latter makes cutting and removing the cookie rounds much easier.) Cut out cookie rounds using a 2-inch cookie cutter of your choice. For half the rounds, use a smaller cookie cutter (around 3/4 inch) to cut patterned holes — these are the windows for the cookie “lids.” Save the minis to make miniature cookie sandwiches (or just to nosh!) If the dough becomes too soft as you’re using it, just pop it into the freezer for a few minutes to firm it up again., Place the “lids” and cookie holes on one baking sheet and the whole cookies on another, since the whole cookies may take a little longer to bake. Bake both sheets of cookies until golden at the edges, about 10 minutes for the bottoms and 8-9 for the lids. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling. Repeat with remaining dough; you can re-chill and re-roll cookie scraps as many times as needed., If powdering the lids, arrange the lids (or all the cookies, if you prefer) on a baking rack with a tray or paper underneath to catch the excess sugar. Sift powdered sugar over top as desired., While the cookies are cooling, make the caramel. Prepare a bowl of ice water and set it aside within easy reach. Combine sugar and water in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Stir just until sugar dissolves, then let simmer, without stirring, until the mixture just turns golden. Remove immediately from heat and add butter (be careful, as it may sputter). Swirl until the butter is dissolved, then add the creme fraiche or heavy cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Return to heat, reduce heat to low and stir until the heavy cream is fully dissolved. Drop a small spoonful of the caramel into the ice water and touch it — if you can form it into a pliable ball, it’s done. (See Izy’s tutorial for step-by-step GIFs.), Working quickly, while the caramel is still soft, drop about a teaspoon of caramel onto each of the bottoms of the cookies, then place a lid on top and press gently to seal. Sprinkle a bit of flaky salt over top if you like. Enjoy once the caramel is cool.

Cut 2 pieces of parchment paper as wide as your pan and leave the pieces as long as the sheet comes (the excess will create handles that you can use to lift the bars out the pan after baking). Lay one piece of parchment in the pan, with overhang on both sides. Tuck the paper into the corners of the pan. Spray the parchment paper in the pan with cooking spray. Place the second sheet on top, positioning it so that the excess parchment covers the other two sides of the pan and is tucked into the corners; set aside., Heat the oven to 350°. To make the crust, crush the cookies in a food processor and add the melted and cooled vegan butter or coconut oil, the pinch of salt and process to combine and when it comes together, it’s done. Pour into the prepared pan and press into the corners. I find using a bench scraper is best to get it all packed down and in place but the bottom of a glass will work as well and you can use your fingers to press the corners in place. Try to be as even as possible., Layer the bars. Pour the vegan sweetened condensed milk evenly over the crumb mixture (you can gently move it with a rubber spatula or bang the pan on the counter gently to even it out to the edges). It should spread quickly and evenly over the mixture and will not sink in. Sprinkle the chocolate chips evenly over the top, then the coconut, and finally then nuts., Bake for 25-30 minutes until the nuts are toasty and it’s puffed up slightly (it will fall when cooled). I added a few more chips to the top post baking and they melt in but still stay looking like chips. It’s optional but looks nice. Let the bars cool completely at room temperature then refrigerate for 2 hours or preferably overnight so that they easy to cut. I start with a cut in the center then cut again between that cut and the edge to get more even cuts than if I started at the end of the bars. Store leftovers in the fridge as they get hard to eat and handle at room temperature. These also freeze well.

As you can see from the photos, I made them 2 different ways. One version is with just a pecan placed on top, which is pretty. But the 2nd version I chopped up tiny pieces of pecans and put them in the batter. That was my favorite version! Since these are oat flour based cookies, oat flour tends to dry out easily and quicker. So, these buttery pecan bits throughout give a wonderful flavor and texture. These have a strong cardamom flavor. If you do not like cardamom, you can try subbing cinnamon, I have not tested this personally., I use this scale.","Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper., To a large bowl, add the oat flour, baking soda, coconut sugar, cardamom and salt and whisk very well., To the same bowl, pour in the syrup, almond butter, vanilla and 1/2 cup pecans. Stir together all the ingredients until a thick, cohesive dough forms. This may take a minute or so before it all comes together and should be moist and the dough easy to work with and form into balls., Roll into balls about 1 1/2 tablespoons worth of dough. With the version for the 1/2 cup chopped pecans, you will get 18 cookies. For the version with just a pecan on top, you will get 14., Place the balls onto the pan spaced 2 inches apart, as they will spread. Bake 1 batch at a time., Press each ball down between 1/4-1/2 inch thick, molding the edges to keep them round. Be careful you don't press them too flat or they will overbake/dry out., Bake for just 7-8 minutes. They should have spread some, puffed up and have nice cracks throughout. This doesn't seem long, but trust me, since these are made with oat flour, they dry out much quicker, so over-baking them will result in dry cookies. Do NOT be tempted to bake them longer. See how the first batch goes before first., Cool on the pan just 10 minutes. They will flatten back out some as they cool. Use a spatula to transfer them (if you pull off with your hands, they may break) to cool another 5 minutes on a cooling rack, then devour. They will continue to finish cooking as they cool, so leave them to cool as instructed. Since ovens vary, you may need to test the first batch to see if they need another minute more, or less, baking time., As soon as they've fully cooled, store in a sealed container to keep them moist. These are best the first day, as they do start to dry out due to the oat flour.","[('superfine oat flour', 160.0, 'g'), ('baking soda', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('coconut sugar', 24.0, 'g'), ('ground cardamom', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('pure maple syrup', 160.0, 'g'), ('super creamy roasted almond butter', 160.0, 'g'), ('vanilla extract', 8.0, 'g'), ('chopped pecans', 70.0, 'g'), (None, 14.0, 'pecans')]"

Tip: Don’t cream or aerate the mixture, as that can make the cookies spread out in the oven and lose their shape, which is something you want to avoid (note the absence of any raising agents for the same reason)., Sift in the gluten free flour blend, corn starch, xanthan gum and salt. Mix it all together until you get a fairly dry mixture – it will be very crumbly and it won’t stick together very well., Add the milk and mix well until it starts coming together., Give it a thorough knead (because it’s gluten free you don’t need to worry about over-working the dough!) until it comes together in a smooth ball. The cookie dough might be very slightly crumbly or crack in places, but it should hold together well., Roll the dough to a thickness of about 4-5mm between two sheets of baking/parchment paper. Tip: Rolling between sheets of baking/parchment paper reduces cracking and also means that you don’t need to flour your surface, which in turn eliminates the possibility of incorporating extra flour into the cookie dough., Use a 2 inch (5cm) round cookie cutter to cut out the cookies. Re-roll any scraps to make more cookies until you've used up all the cookie dough. You should get about 22 cookies., Transfer them onto the lined baking sheets and bake them, one baking sheet at a time, at 320ºF (160ºC) for about 20-24 minutes or until evenly golden brown. Tip: The slightly lower oven temperature (compared to the more usual 350ºF/180ºC) works better here, as it gives a more even bake., Allow to cool on the baking sheets for about 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire cooling rack to cool completely. Set aside until needed., Homemade caramel:, In a saucepan (or in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave), heat the double/heavy cream and half of the butter together until hot and all the butter has melted. Set aside until needed, making sure that the mixture stays warm., In another saucepan, combine the sugar and golden syrup, and cook over medium-high heat with frequent stirring until the mixture reaches 295ºF (145ºC)., Remove from heat, pour in the cream mixture and stir well until combined., Return to the heat and cook with constant stirring until the mixture reaches 235-240ºF (112-116ºC). Immediately remove from heat and stir in the remaining butter and salt (optional).Tip: In the 235-240ºF (112-116ºC) temperature range, the sugar is in the so-called 'softball' stage. This means that once cooled to room temperature, the caramel will be pleasantly chewy, without being too soft or too hard., Allow the caramel to cool to 120-130ºF (50-55ºC) before assembling the cookies., Assembling the caramel cookies:, Once the caramel has cooled to 120-130ºF (50-55ºC), transfer it into a piping bag fitted with a small round nozzle (the nozzle diameter should be about ⅓ inch/8mm)., Pipe the caramel in a spiral going out from the centre of the cookie (see the post for photos). Make sure to leave about 3-4mm of caramel-free space around the edge, as the caramel will spread ever so slightly after piping., Chill the caramel-topped cookies in the fridge for about 30 minutes. Tip: This sets the caramel even further, which helps when you dip the cookies into the slightly warm chocolate in the next step., Chocolate shell:, Dip the slightly chilled caramel-topped cookies into melted chocolate (ideally, use tempered chocolate for the best shine and crisp texture)., After you’ve dipped them into the chocolate, lift them out with a fork and make sure to allow the excess chocolate to drip away – you want a fairly thin, even chocolate layer. To achieve this, I like to use a small offset spatula to gently remove the excess chocolate from the top of the cookie, and then tap the fork on the side of the bowl to shake off the rest., Place the chocolate-covered cookies on a wire rack (ideally, cover the wire rack with a sheet of cling film, as that makes it easy to remove the cookies after the chocolate has firmed up) and allow the chocolate to set at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. If it’s correctly tempered, you shouldn’t need to refrigerate the cookies., Decorating (optional):, Use the leftover chocolate to drizzle or pipe a few ‘zig-zag’ lines on top of the set chocolate shell, and then sprinkle them with some flaky sea salt., Allow the chocolate decoration to set before serving., Storage:, The cookies keep well in a closed container in a cool dry place for about 1 week.","[('unsalted butter', 65, 'g'), ('sugar', 30, 'g'), ('vanilla paste', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('gluten free flour blend', 130, 'g'), ('corn starch', 30, 'g'), ('xanthan gum', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('salt', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('whole milk', 20, 'g'), ('heavy cream', 180, 'g'), ('unsalted butter', 30, 'g'), ('sugar', 100, 'g'), ('golden syrup', 80, 'g'), ('salt', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('dark chocolate', 400, 'g')]"

Bring to a boil, without stirring or touching the mixture, and cook until sugar is amber in color - this can take up to 15-20 minutes but it will burn very quickly once color starts to form., Immediately remove sugar from the heat and place on your towel. Slowly pour in the coconut milk and vanilla while gently stirring with a wooden spoon. The mixture will bubble up and be very hot, so be careful! Gently stir the caramel until it stops bubbling., Return caramel to medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Boil caramel for 5-10 minutes or until it thickens, stirring occasionally.

Immediately make wells (or ""thumbprints"") in your hot, baked cookies, using any rounded tool - like a measuring spoon or the cap to a bottle., Allow cookies to cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheet, re-press your wells (if needed), and then transfer to a cooling rack. Continue once more until all cookies are baked., Once your cookies have cooled, spoon the cooled caramel into the wells. If your caramel is too thick to easily spoon, simply transfer it to a microwave-safe jar (or bowl) and heat until it's thin enough to spoon., Top the caramel with sea salt flakes and allow cookies to set. Once set, you can store cookies in a single layer in a structured, airtight container (not plastic bag) at room temperature or in the refrigerator.","[('coconut cream', 0.5, 'cup'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('white granulated sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('water', 0.5, 'cup'), ('unbleached all-purpose flour', 1.0, 'cup'), ('natural cocoa powder', 0.5, 'cup'), ('baking powder', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('baking soda', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('salt', 0.125, 'tsp'), ('coconut sugar', 0.75, 'cup'), ('olive oil', 0.33, 'cup'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('flax egg', 1.0, None)]"

Gently add the corn syrup and 1/4 cup water, making sure the sugar doesn’t splash up on the sides of the pan. Cook over high heat, without stirring., When the sugar starts to color on the edges, gently stir the sugar until it is quite dark and smokes a bit. Once the caramel is dark, reduce the heat and slowly add half the cream. The caramel will sputter and seize up, which is normal. Gently whisk the caramel until the caramelized sugar dissolves.

Place the dough between two sheets of parchment and roll out the cookie dough to a 1/8-inch thickness.

Stamp out the cookies with a cookie cutter of your choice, being sure that half of the cookies (the cookie tops) have something stamped out of the center so we get that linzer effect., Transfer the cookies to the baking sheet, spacing them about 1-inch apart (these spread slightly). Re-roll the scraps to get a few more cookies. Repeat with the second disc of dough., Bake the cookies, one baking sheet at a time, for about 8 to 10 minutes, until lightly golden brown around the edges.

Pulse together until coarse and well combined. While pulsing, stream in 1/2 cup melted butter and continue pulsing until the crumbs come together in giant clumps., Use a rubber spatula to transfer the crumbs into a 9-inch tart pan with high sides and a removable bottom — there's no need to grease the pan. Use your fingers and the back of your hands to press the crumbs onto the bottom and sides of the pan, creating an even layer. The bottom and sides of the crust should be around 1/4-inch thick., Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly while you make the filling. Be sure to keep the oven on!, For the Pumpkin Custard Filling and Crème Fraîche Swirl, In a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, combine 1 can pumpkin puree, 2/3 cup granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar, 2 teaspoons ground cardamom, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher sea salt. Cook for 5 minutes, using a heatproof rubber spatula to scrape the bottom and sides of the pan frequently. The mixture should start to sputter around 2 to 3 minutes in, and by 5 minutes, become thick and glossy., Remove from heat and slowly stream in 1 can sweetened condensed milk while continuing to whisk the mixture. Continue whisking until the sweetened condensed milk is fully incorporated, before whisking in 2 large eggs, one at a time, only adding the second egg when the first one has fully incorporated., Once the eggs are fully incorporated, pour the mixture into the prepared cookie crust shell. Transfer 2 ounces crème fraîche into a piping bag (or, in a pinch, a Ziploc bag with the corner snipped off) and drizzle the crème fraîche over the mixture in the pattern you desire (you can use this awesome Food52 guide for a quick tutorial on marbling). Use a bamboo skewer or toothpick with a sharp point to swirl the crème fraîche across the filling., Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges of the filling have set. The filling may have bubbled and puffed slightly in the oven, but don't worry — it settles down as it cools. You can use a knife to tap on the sides of the tart pan to test the filling; the middle should wobble slightly, but the edges should stay in the same place. Be careful not to overcook — it's better to pull it out of the oven earlier than later, as the filling will continue to cook after it's pulled out the oven. Transfer to a wire rack and cool completely until fully set. Serve at room temperature, or chilled for an hour.

Scrape down the bowl, then mix in the flour mixture on low speed. Scoop the dough by heaping tablespoons (it's easiest to use a 1½ tablespoon ice cream scoop) onto the prepared baking sheets.

Remove from the oven and let rest for a few minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer with a spatula to a wire rack.

Bake as needed directly from the freezer. (Allow 1 to 2 minutes longer in the oven.)

Line a few baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. These cookies tend to stick, so I highly recommend some sort of liner instead of baking straight on the pan., In a large bowl or stand mixer, beat the butter for about 2 minutes, until it is smooth and creamy. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure there are no lumps., Add 3/4 cup granulated sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. Beat 1 minute until fluffy., Add 1 cup pumpkin puree (make sure it's not pumpkin pie filling!), Add 1 and 1/2 teaspoons vanilla and 1 large egg. Beat until combined, scraping sides. The dough will look kind of grainy at this point., Use a spoon to measure your flour into your measuring cup, then level off the top. Add the 2 and 1/2 cups flour to the bowl, but don't mix yet., Make a well in the center of the flour, and add 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice. Use your teaspoon to stir these ingredients into the flour a bit so you don't end up with any clumps of baking soda in your cookies., Turn the mixer on and combine the dry and wet ingredients. Mix ONLY until combined and no more. Use a spatula to scrape the bottom of the bowl. If you see any streaks, mix it some more. Do not over mix, or your dough will be tough., Use two spoons to drop the cookie dough onto the prepared pans. The dough is more like a batter; very wet and sticky. I tried using a cookie scoop but it just sticks too much. I scraped up a heaping tablespoon of dough with one spoon (I used a larger soup spoon) and scraped it onto the pan using another spoon. It doesn't need to be an exact ball shape. Leave about 2 inches of space in between each cookie., Bake in the preheated oven for 12-14 minutes, or until the cookies are no longer shiny on top. Normally I under-bake my cookies to keep them chewy, but these cookies are more like tiny little pumpkin cakes; nobody wants raw batter in the center of a cake. If the shine from the top of the cookies is completely gone, take them out. They should be nice and tall and puffy., Let the cookies cool and set up on the pan for about 5 minutes., Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. I always cheat and throw my cooling rack directly in the freezer to speed up the cooling process. Takes like 5 minutes, and then you can glaze right away., To make the icing: In a small saucepan, add 3 tablespoons salted butter. Turn the heat to medium and let the butter melt. Keep the heat on medium and don't walk away. Stir occasionally. Soon the butter will bubble and form a thick white foam on top. After that, the foam will recede a little bit and you will start to see little brown ""bits"" forming on the bottom of the pan. Stir them up and take a whiff. If you see brown specks and your butter has taken on a nutty aroma, your butter is browned. Take it off the heat right away. The whole process doesn't take more than 3-4 minutes for this amount of butter. It goes from browned to burned real quick, so pay attention!, Place a strainer over the top of the saucepan, and add 3 cups of powdered sugar (I did it 1 cup at a time). Sift the powdered sugar into the butter. (You might be thinking ""I don't have time for sifting. Sifting is for suckers."" That's what I thought the first time I made this, and my icing was lumpy. No amount of whisking smoothed it out, and I ended up pressing my finished glaze through a strainer. Don't be like me.), Once you've added all the powdered sugar, add 4 tablespoons of cream or milk. Whisk it all together until smooth. At this point you can add more powdered sugar or cream/milk, depending on the consistency you want for your glaze. If you want it to be thicker (more like frosting) add less milk/cream. You can also add a bit more powdered sugar., Once the cookies have cooled completely, drizzle over the tops of each cookie., These cookies don't do well stored in a tupperware, they are too moist. It's better to store them on a plate with plastic wrap loosely covering them (once the glaze has set). I'm a huge fan of warm cookies, but these ones are actually really delicious when chilled in the fridge.

It will be extremely thin, but there is enough!, Bake the individual layers. Bake the layer for 8 to 10 minutes, until just set (the cake may look undercooked, but this is what you want). Repeat with the remaining bowls of cake batter and sheet pans, transferring each baked cake to a wire rack to cool completely., Assemble the layers with preserves. When all the layers are cool, invert the green layer onto a parchment- or wax paper-lined baking sheet. Peel off the paper from the layer and brush on half of the heated preserves. Flip the white layer on top of the green layer and peel off the paper. Spread with remaining preserves. Invert the red layer on top of white layer and discard the paper., Chill overnight. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and place another quarter sheet pan on top, right side up. Evenly distribute a heavy weight on top of the sheet pan — I place heavy cookbooks on top! — and place in the fridge to chill for at least 8 hours or overnight., Bring the cake to room temperature. Remove the weights and plastic wrap and let the layer sit on your counter for a few minutes to come to room temperature. Melt the chocolate wafers in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second increments, until smooth., Pour on melted chocolate. Trim the edges of the assembled layers with a long serrated knife to even them out. Use a small offset spatula to quickly (like REALLY quickly) spread half of the melted chocolate in a thin layer on top of the cake. Place the cake back in the fridge to firm up the chocolate, about 10-15 minutes. Place a sheet of wax paper on top of the chocolate layer, place another quarter sheet pan on top, then invert the cake and remove the paper. Quickly spread with the remaining chocolate. Freeze the chocolate-covered cake until just slightly firm, about 10 minutes., Slice cookies. Cut lengthwise into 6 strips, then cut each strip crosswise into 16 pieces. The cookies are much easier to cut when cold, but if they're completely frozen solid (like you forget them in the freezer and came back to them the next day), allow to thaw slightly or the chocolate will crack as you slice into it., The cookies can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge or freezer.","('eggs', 4.0, 'large'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('almond paste', 8.0, 'ounces'), ('unsalted butter', 2.5, 'sticks'), ('almond extract', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('all-purpose flour', 2.0, 'cups'), ('kosher salt', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('raspberry preserves', 10.0, 'ounces'), ('semisweet chocolate', 7.0, 'ounces')"

(Alternately, you can do what I did: melt the chocolate about 3.5 ounces at a time just to make sure it doesn’t firm up between steps)., Trim edges of assembled layers with a long serrated knife. Quickly spread half of chocolate in a thin layer on top of cake. Chill, uncovered, until chocolate is firm, about 15 minutes., Cover with another sheet of wax paper and place another baking sheet on top, then invert cake onto sheet and remove paper. Quickly spread with remaining chocolate. Chill until firm, about 30 minutes., With a serrated knife cut the cake into rows, then cut the rows into squares or rectangles. Be sure to use a wet towel to clean knife after each slice. Try to cut while they are still very cold. If you notice the chocolate melting too quickly after first slices, place in the refrigerator again to let it chill some more and then cut again., You could cut into 4 portions or cut into more like I did. I wanted the cookies to be about 1 1/2 inches wide. The cookies should be cut about 3/4 inch wide. If you have the patience and the time, do freeze the cake before slicing.

Spread 1/4 cup raspberry jam on top of the white cake layer. Then cut and fold the red layer in half, and carefully transfer the red layer to be on top of the white layer. You should now have the green layer on the bottom, the yellow layer in the middle, and the red layer on top., Cover the top of the red layer with a piece of parchment paper and place heavy books or dishes on top of the cookie layers.

Lightly grease three 8"" square pans or line each pan with a parchment sling. If you only have one 8"" square pan, that’s OK; you can bake the layers one at a time., To make the cake: Break the almond paste into large chunks and place them into a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the sugar and salt, and mix using an electric hand mixer or the flat beater attachment on a stand mixer until sandy. The almond paste should break down into smaller pieces and become uniform in size.  , Add the butter and almond extract. Beat until the mixture is slightly fluffy and lightened in color, stopping to scrape the sides of the bowl as needed.  , Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing until each is fully incorporated before adding the next.  , Add the flour and mix until smooth.  , Divide the batter into thirds: Portion approximately 1 cup (235g) of batter into 2 medium bowls. Leave the remaining third in the mixing bowl. , To one bowl, add red coloring. To another bowl, add green coloring. The remaining batter in the mixing bowl is the plain layer.  , Transfer each of the batters to one of the prepared pans and spread evenly (a small offset spatula is a helpful tool here); the layers will be thin. If you only have one 8"" square pan, start by baking the plain layer first while the other batters rest at room temperature, then bake the green layer, then the red layer. There’s no need to wash the pan between bakes — just be sure that the pan has cooled completely before baking the next layer.   , Bake each layer for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the cake springs back to the touch and looks dry in the center.   , Remove the cakes from the oven and cool in the pan for 10 minutes before turning them out to cool completely on a rack. Be sure that all of the cake layers are completely cool before assembling.  , To assemble the rainbow cookies: Spread 1/4 cup (85g) of the jam on top of the green layer of cake, spreading it all the way to the edges. Place the plain layer of cake on top of the jam and apply firm pressure to sandwich the two layers together.  , Spread the remaining 1/4 cup (85g) jam over the top of the plain layer, spreading it all the way to the edges. Place the red layer of cake on top and, again, apply firm pressure to sandwich all 3 layers together. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap.  , Place the wrapped layers in a 9"" x 13"" pan (or any pan larger than an 8"" square) and place an 8"" square pan on top. Place 4 to 6 heavy cans (or something of comparable weight) inside the 8"" square pan to weigh it down, compressing the cake layers below. Refrigerate the layers overnight with the heavy weights on top. , To glaze the rainbow cookies: Remove the cake layers from the refrigerator, unwrap, and place the cake, green-layer down, on a cutting board. In a medium microwave-safe bowl, place 1/2 cup (85g) of the chocolate wafers and heat in 20-second increments at 50% power until melted. (Alternatively, melt the chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring frequently.) Stir the chocolate until smooth.  , Spread the melted chocolate over the top of the red layer of cake, spreading it all the way to the edges. It’s OK if some chocolate drips down over the edges.  , Allow the chocolate to set either at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Before the chocolate fully sets, use the tines of a fork to create wavy lines in the chocolate. , Once fully set, flip the assembled layers over. In the same microwave-safe bowl or saucepan, melt the remaining 1/2 cup (85g) chocolate wafers until smooth.  , Spread the melted chocolate over the top of the green layer of cake, spreading it all the way to the edges. It’s OK if some chocolate drips down over the edges.  , Allow the chocolate to set either at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Before the chocolate fully sets, use the tines of a fork to create wavy lines in the chocolate. , Once fully set, use a warm chef’s knife to trim the sides of the square (baker’s snack!) for a neat presentation before cutting the remainder of the rainbow cookies into pieces. (We like using an 8 x 4 pattern to make slices about 1 3/4"" x 1” in size.) Serve the rainbow cookies at room temperature.   , Storage information: Store any leftover rainbow cookies in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks; freeze for longer storage (see ""tips,"" below).

Refrigerate for 60-90 minutes. Melt chocolate in either the microwave (I melt in 30 second increments while stirring) or in a double boiler. Remove peanut butter balls from fridge and dip in chocolate, then place back on parchment. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.

Line two large, rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper so the fries don’t get stuck to the pans., Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into fry-shaped pieces about 1/4″ wide and 1/4″ thick. Try to cut them into similarly sized pieces so the fries will bake evenly. Transfer half of the uncooked fries to one baking sheet, and the other half to the other baking sheet., Sprinkle the sweet potato fries with the cornstarch (use 1 1/2 teaspoons per pan) and salt (1/4 teaspoon per pan). Toss until the fries are lightly coated in powder. Drizzle the olive oil over the fries (1 tablespoon per pan) and toss until the fries are lightly and evenly coated in oil, and no powdery spots remain (use your fingers to rub visible cornstarch into the fries as necessary)., Arrange your fries in a single layer and don’t overcrowd; otherwise they will never crisp up. Bake for 20 minutes, then flip the fries so they can cook on all sides. (The easiest way to flip them is with a metal spatula. Section by section, scoop up about ten fries and flip them with a quick turn of the wrist.), Arrange the fries in even layers across the pans again, moving any particularly browned fries more toward the middle of the pan so they don’t get overcooked. Return the pans to the oven, swapping their positions (former top pan goes to the lower rack and vice versa)., Bake for 10 to 18 more minutes, or until the fries are crispy. You’ll know they’re almost done when the surface of the fries change from shiny orange to a more matte, puffed up texture. Keep an eye on them, as they can turn from crisp to burnt quickly. Sometimes the lower pan will be done a few minutes before the top pan. Don’t worry if the edges are a little bit brown; they will taste more caramelized than burnt., If desired, toss the baked fries with seasonings, to taste.

But not these ones. Tiny is better.), Place the cookie dough balls on the prepared baking sheets with about 2 inches in between each cookie. The dough is pretty soft because of the oil, but fear not, they bake up just fine., Add 1/4 cup of granulated sugar to a plate. Lightly wet the bottom of a drinking glass that has a flat bottom. Dip the glass in the sugar and use it to smash one cookie dough ball. Dip in sugar again and repeat with the remaining dough. You want to smash the cookies so they are about 1/4 inch thick., Press one red hot in the middle of each cookie, if you want., Bake at 350 for about 10-12 minutes. You want the edges of the cookie to be light brown, and there should be no shine in the center of the cookie. The bake time also depends on how much you smashed them., Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes on the pan, then remove to a cooling rack to cool completely., Eat 500 a day until they are gone.

The butter should be soft but NOT melty, Crack one whole egg in a bowl and whisk to loosen up the egg. Measure out 25 grams of egg to be used in the recipe. It is important to measure by weight, Mix instant coffee with water and set aside, Prepare cookie dough:, You don't need a mixer to prepare the cookie dough. Mash the softened butter with the brown sugar using a rubber spatula. Then add the room-temperature egg and mix again until combined. Add the instant coffee mixture and vanilla extract and mix again, Sift the dry ingredients into the butter mixture. Add oil. Use a spatula to start mixing. The mixture will still be dry at first.

If you can do it overnight, that's even better because the flavor gets even better (I know waiting can be a pain, but this is worth waiting). They can be kept in the fridge for 3-4 days, When ready to bake: (updates on baking temperature and time, read my post above for details), Preheat the oven to 350 F (180 C) for a conventional oven. For a convection oven, lower the temperature by 20 F or 15 C, I no longer recommend baking two trays at one go. It's so hard to get both trays of cookies to turn out right. Everyone's oven is different. Please bake one tray at a time, Line the baking pan with parchment paper, Scoop about 8 grams of the cookie dough and roll into a round ball and put them about 1 inch apart as they will spread some during baking, If the cookies have gotten too soft after all the handling, you can put the whole tray in the freezer again for 15 minutes before baking. This helps to prevent the cookies from spreading too much, UPDATE: I suggest baking 2-3 cookies first and see how they behave (whether they spread too much or not). Some of you have shared with me that your cookies spread more and some didn't spread at all and prefer that they spread a bit more. If they spread too much, you may want to chill the cookie longer and if the cookies don't spread at all, you may not need to chill the dough before baking. It could be that the dough is too cold and or ingredients aren't measured correctly (too much flour, etc)., Bake for 18 minutes for a lighter color pan and about 15 minutes for a darker color pan. The timing is just for your reference. It also depends on how big you size the cookies. You know your oven better and so please adjust accordingly. If you want the cookies really crunchy, add a minute or two (or could be 5 minutes longer, depending on your oven), Cooling:, The cookies appear very soft when they are out from the oven. Let the cookies cool down on the rack for 5 minutes and then remove and cool down completely at a cooling rack. They will crisp up further, If your cookies do not stay crispy after the next day, they can be easily re-crisp in the oven at 350 F (180 C) for 3-5 minutes and then let them cool down and they will be crispy again, Age the cookies for a day:, Usually cookies (or pretty much any baked goods) won't taste as good on the same day you bake them. If you can wait until the next day, you will be rewarded with a much better flavor and texture., Storage:, Store the cookies in an air-tight cookie jar.

Do not mix fully yet at this point., Add the chocolate discs then continue to mix on low speed just until all the flour is incorporated into the dough and the chocolate is evenly distributed., Portion the dough out into 2-inch balls and place them onto a tray or a big container—I like using a #30 scoop for this and I fill it so it's just a bit rounded on the bottom. Separate each layer of dough with plastic wrap so they don't stick together. *If using chocolate discs, check to see if there are any large disc of chocolate exposed on the bottom of the ball, if so, push some dough to cover it. Because these chocolate discs are so large, if you have an big exposed piece sitting flat on the bottom it'll just melt and stick to the pan when baking and you'll lose chocolate!, Cover the dough tightly and refrigerate for 48 hours.

The butter will begin to crackle, and then eventually foam. Make sure you whisk constantly during this process. After a couple of minutes, the butter will begin to brown and turn a nice golden amber color on the bottom of the saucepan. Continue to whisk and remove from heat as soon as the butter begins to brown and give off a nutty aroma. Immediately transfer the butter to a medium bowl to prevent burning.

That way you can simply place them on the prepared baking sheet and bake! Up to you.

You might need to take out the dough and thaw it out a bit before measuring the dough if it is super hard and you did not already roll the cookie dough into balls. This should take about 20 minutes. Once ready to bake, measure 2 heaping tablespoons of the dough or use a medium cookie scoop. It doesn't have to be perfectly rolled. Place dough balls on cookie sheet, 2 inches apart., Bake the cookies 9-11 minutes or until the edges of the cookies begin to turn golden brown.

You should get 16 cookies in total.Place them onto a baking sheet lined with baking/greaseproof paper, cover tightly with cling film and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.Tip: The cookies will be even better if you chill them overnight before baking., Adjust the oven rack to the middle position, pre-heat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC) and line another baking sheet with baking/greaseproof paper.Tip: You will bake the cookies in several batches, so you can line 2-3 baking sheets if you have them on hand. Otherwise, just re-use the same baking sheet, but make sure to cool it completely before you place the next batch of unbaked cookies onto it., In batches (at most, 6-8 at a time), place the chilled cookie dough balls on the lined baking sheet, leaving plenty of space between them (about 2 inches/5 cm), as they will spread out during baking., Bake the cookies at 350ºF (180ºC) for 12-15 minutes in total, depending on your preferred cookie texture and consistency (a shorter time will give you very gooey cookies, a longer baking time will give you more fudgy cookies). They should be light golden on top and golden brown around the edges when done.At the 8-9 minute mark, take the baking sheet out of the oven, tap/bang it 5-7 times onto the kitchen counter, and place a few pieces of the reserved chocolate on top of each cookie.Return the cookies to the oven and bake until done. You can tap the baking sheet again at 2-minute intervals until the cookies are baked, to give them an extra rippled, crinkled appearance, if you wish.Tip 1: Tapping the cookie sheet on the kitchen counter helps the cookies to flatten, thus giving them their characteristic shape and appearance. Omit the tapping if you want thicker cookies.Tip 2: Adding the reserved chopped chocolate to the tops of the cookies halfway through baking will give you those gorgeous glossy puddles of melted chocolate., Immediately out of the oven, you can correct the shape of the cookies into a more evenly round one. To do this, use a round cookie cutter slightly larger than the cookie diameter to nudge the cookies into shape., Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely., Repeat the baking instructions for the remaining balls of cookie dough, then once all the cookies are baked and cooled, sprinkle with flaky sea salt (optional) before serving., Storage:The gluten free chocolate chip cookies keep well in a closed container at room temperature for about 1 week. Note that the cookies will get a bit softer and chewier with time.Alternatively, you can store raw, unbaked balls of cookie dough in an airtight container in the fridge for about 1 week, or in the freezer for 1-2 months. Bake the cookie balls directly from chilled or frozen, just adding 2-3 minutes to the baking time to compensate.

(or half a stick) of butter.Oh, wait... you didn't know we were doing that? We are. I'd tell you how here, butThe Kitchn once again does the best job of explaining it with extremely helpful photos. Pop it in the fridge while you gather the other ingredients. Don't start mixing the dough until the browned butter is slightly cool. You’re still using only two total sticks (or one cup) of butter, but half of one of those sticks get special treatment., Sift together the dry ingredients.With a sifter or a mesh sieve, sift the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, baking powder, and salt onto a piece of parchment paper, wax paper, or a paper towel. Sifting into a separate bowl means I have to wash a separate bowl, and I give a big ol' hard no to that., Cream together the butter and sugars.Do this for two minutes until fluffy. To achieve the right texture and optimal cookie texture, the butter should be at room temperature, i.e. out on the counter for half an hour before mixing., Add two eggs and one yolk one at a time, mixing on medium-low speed. Don't add the next egg until the last one has fully disappeared., Add the vanilla and cooled (but still mostly melted) browned butter.Make sure it's fully incorporated., Add dry ingredients.Use low speed, and add gradually. You'll avoid a flour shower, and the dough will come together better. Stop mixing when there are just a few streaks of flour left., Add the chocolate chips.As you stir them in, the remaining flour will incorporate into the dough. When the flour disappears, stop mixing. More mixing means tough cookies, and we don't want that., Scoop and chill the dough.Use a cookie scoop (my beloved) or two spoons, and portion out 1-2 tbsp-sized cookie dough balls onto a parchment-lined sheet pan. The cookies can tough each other; they're just going to chill. Cover the pan with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for 24-72 hours. I usually do 48; two days gives better flavor than one and is more difficult to forget about than three. (I've forgotten about 72 hour dough so many times.), Bake.When you're ready for cookies, preheat the oven to 375. Spread the dough balls on a parchment-lined sheet pan (no mess!) a couple of inches apart from each other. Bake 9-11 minutes depending on your oven and the size of the dough. You're looking for crispy brown edges and a barely-cooked center. If it looks doughy, you're close. If it looks done, you've gone too far. You want to juuuuuust barely get past the center being raw dough.

You want dough balls that are about 1 and 1/2 to 2 inches across. I used this cookie scoop., Roll the cookies. In a small or medium bowl, add 1/3 cup sugar and 1 and 1/2 tablespoons cinnamon. Stir together. Roll the shaped cookies in the cinnamon-sugar to coat. (Reserve the remaining cinnamon-sugar!), Place cookie dough balls on the prepared baking sheet with about 2 inches in between them. I can fit 12 cookies on an 11x17 baking sheet., Bake the cookies at 350 for about 9-11 minutes, until the edges are barely set. It's ok if the centers of the cookies (about the size of a quarter) are still shiny. The rest of the cookie should be matte. It's VERY important to not over bake snickerdoodles; underbaking slightly is what helps give them that soft and chewy texture. (Dry Snickerdoodles taste like chalk. Don't be like that.), Shape the cookies. Immediately after taking the cookies out of the oven, use a spoon to push the edges of the cookies toward their centers. This makes the cookies round in shape and makes the center thicker and more chewy. You have to do this within 30-60 seconds of taking them out of the oven, before the edges harden. Enlist help if you can! See my Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe for more details about this technique!, Let the cookies set up on the pan for at least 3-5 minutes. Remove the cookies to a wire cooling rack and let cool for a few minutes., While the cookies are still warm, but cool enough to handle (and not falling apart), place each cookie back into the bowl of cinnamon sugar*. Coat one side of the cookie, then flip it over and coat the other side. This gives you the ultimate cinnamon-sugar edge to your snickerdoodle! Enjoy one right away with a glass of milk!, Freezer instructions: You can freeze this dough and bake later! I like to shape the dough into balls, roll them in cinnamon sugar, and store them in a ziplock bag. They will keep in the freezer for up to 3 months. I never thaw cookie dough before baking. Just bake straight from frozen and add a couple minutes to the bake time.

Set aside for about 5-10 minutes, until the raisins have plumped up and re-hydrated.Drain the water, making sure to squeeze out any excess water from the raisins. Set aside until needed., In a large bowl, whisk together the softened butter, light brown sugar, granulated sugar and orange zest until pale and somewhat fluffy (but no need to get it super fluffy, like you might when making a sponge cake or buttercream). You can do this by hand using a balloon whisk, with a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or with a hand mixer fitted with the double beaters.Tip: You can rub the orange zest into the granulated sugar with your fingertips before adding them to the rest of the ingredients, as that helps to release the essential oils from the zest and makes the cookies even more fragrant., Add the egg and vanilla, and whisk until combined., In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, and add them to the butter-sugar mixture., Use a rubber spatula or a wooden spoon to mix it all together until you get a smooth dough. Note that the dough will be VERY soft and sticky at this stage., Add the oats, re-hydrated raisins and chopped walnuts. Mix it all together until combined and the add-ins are evenly distributed within the cookie dough., Chill the cookie dough in the fridge for about 30-45 minutes.Tip: If you like your oatmeal cookies thinner and crisper, you can skip this chilling step. If you prefer them thicker and chewier, you can chill them for up to 1 hour. See the blog post for more details and photos., While the cookie dough is chilling, adjust the oven rack to the middle position, pre-heat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC) and line 2-3 large baking sheets with baking/parchment paper.Tip: You will bake the cookies in several batches, so you can line 2-3 baking sheets if you have them on hand. Otherwise, just re-use the same baking sheet, but make sure to cool it completely before you place the next batch of unbaked cookies onto it., Once chilled, use a ""2 tablespoon"" ice cream or cookie scoop to scoop individual portions (balls) of cookie dough onto the lined baking sheets. You should get 18 cookies in total. Make sure to leave plenty of space around the cookies on the baking sheet, as they will spread out during baking – I usually fit about 6-8 cookies per baking sheet., Bake the oatmeal cookies, one baking sheet at a time, at 350ºF (180ºC) for 10-12 minutes or until they are light golden brown around the edges. The centres of the cookies will look under-baked (their tops will be very soft and shiny) – that's okay. They should and have to look underbaked if you want to get the perfect soft and chewy texture.Tip: If your cookies aren’t perfectly round, you can correct their shape while they’re still very hot immediately out of the oven. Take a round cookie cutter that’s larger than the cookie diameter, and use it to nudge or scoot the cookies into a more round shape., Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for at least 5-10 minutes before transferring them onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely.Tip: As the cookies cool, they will set and lose their under-baked appearance. They will end up perfectly soft and chewy., Storage:, These gluten free oatmeal cookies keep well stored in an airtight container at room temperature for about 1 week., Making ahead & freezing:, If you’re making these cookies exclusively with the intention to freeze them for baking later, you can make them with about 20-30g (3-4 tablespoons) of gluten free flour blend less than is required in the recipe below., Then, chill the cookie dough in the fridge until it’s firm enough to scoop, and freeze the scooped-out balls of cookie dough (in an airtight container or a ziplock bag) until you want to bake them.Tip: By adding less flour, you’re ensuring that the cookies will spread out properly, even after you’ve kept them in the freezer for a few weeks. Over time, the oats absorb more and more of the moisture in the cookie dough – that's why you need to use less flour if you'll be keeping the unbaked cookies for a longer period of time., Bake them directly from frozen, you might need to bake them for a few minutes longer to account for the extra thawing time in the oven.","[('raisins', 80.0, 'g'), ('butter', 113.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 100.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 50.0, 'g'), ('orange', 1.0, None), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('vanilla', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('flour', 135.0, 'g'), ('xanthan gum', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('baking powder', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('baking soda', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('salt', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('cinnamon', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('oats', 135.0, 'g'), ('walnuts', 60.0, 'g')]"

Snip off the tip of the corner, and pipe out thin, back and forth random icing lines over the cookies. Alternatively, put the icing in a pastry bag fitted with a fine writing piping tip. Pipe lines of icing on the cookies to suggest maple leaf veins; use a real leaf for inspiration., Let the cookies stand until the drizzle completely sets, at least 2 hours.

Repeat this process with the second disc of dough., Royal Icing, To make the royal icing, sift the powdered sugar into a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the meringue powder, water, and maple extract., Whip the icing on high for 2-3 minutes, adding more water as necessary, until the icing is the consistency of thin honey. On dry days, you may need up to a cup of water (or more!). When you drizzle the icing, it should melt back into the rest of the icing in 10-15 seconds. That's how you know it's done! If it's too thick, add more water. If it's too thin, add more powdered sugar or whip it for 1-2 more minutes., Color the icing, as desired and place in bowls, squeeze bottles, or piping bags with tips depending on how you'd like to decorate the cookies., Wreath Decorations, To decorate these cookies like wreaths, pour about 1/2-1 cup of icing into 3 separate bowls. Color one bowl of icing with red food coloring and the other 2 bowls with 2 different tones of green. You can also just use 1 green tone if you like. Pour the colored icings into squeeze bottles or piping bags with tips. Then, pour the remaining white icing into a shallow bowl., Next, dip the top of one cookie into the white icing. Let the excess drip off and then flip it onto a counter. Gently tap the bottom of the cookie to evenly distribute the icing. You can also use a toothpick!, While the white icing is still wet, pipe a circle of green dots around the cookie. Then, use a toothpick to gently drag a circular line through the centers of the dots. (See a tutorial in the video above)., Lastly, use the red icing to pipe 'berries' all around the wreath. Let them set on a wire rack for at least 5-6 hours. Store the set cookies in an airtight container with a piece of parchment between each layer of cookies., If you do not want to decorate the cookies like wreaths, decorate as desired with different colors of icing, sprinkles, chopped nuts, etc. Let the cookies set on a wire rack for 5-6 hours. Store in an airtight container with parchment paper between each layer.","[('pecan', 0.75, 'c'), ('flour', 2.5, 'c'), ('baking powder', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('salt', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('butter', 1.0, 'c'), ('sugar', 0.75, 'c'), ('sugar', 0.25, 'c'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'tbs'), ('eggs', 2.0, None), ('powdered sugar', 4.0, 'c'), ('meringue powder', 3.0, 'tbs'), ('water', 0.5, 'c'), ('maple extract', 1.0, 'tsp')]"

Spread the sugar and pecan mixture over your clean work surface and roll the logs in the mixture until both logs are coated. Wrap each individual log in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or longer. It's easier to slice the dough if it's chilled. You can make this up to 4 days in advance and refrigerate.

Let it come to a boil and then cook it for a few minutes, stirring often (especially the bottom of the pot). It will start to bubble a lot and get a nutty aroma. Check the color under the bubbles often, to see if it has brown particles. This will take around 7-10 minutes and you know it's done when there are brown bits at the bottom and the butter has a very nutty aroma.

Without chilling, the piped cookies will over-spread. If you chill the dough prior to shaping, the dough will be too cold/stiff to pipe., Line 2–3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats, or leave unlined. If unlined, do not grease the pan., In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract, and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine., On low speed, beat in the flour and salt. Turn up to high speed and beat until completely combined. On medium speed, beat in 1.5 Tablespoons of milk. You want a dough that’s creamy and pipe-able (but still thick), so you may need up to 2–2.5 Tablespoons of milk. The more milk you add, the more the cookies will spread, so chilling in step 6 is imperative. I recommend keeping the amount of milk small and using a large enough piping tip, like the ones I suggest in the post above., Add your large piping tip to the piping bag. Spoon a little bit of dough into the piping bag and pipe a 1–2-inch swirl or line on the prepared baking sheet. The reason I suggest only a little bit of dough to start is because the dough may still be too thick to pipe. If it’s too thick, transfer that dough back to the mixing bowl and add another 1/2 Tablespoon of milk. If the dough is creamy enough to pipe, continue piping the dough in 1–2-inch swirls or lines, 3 inches apart on the baking sheet. See video for a visual if needed. If desired, place a maraschino cherry in the center of the swirl or sprinkle the dough with sprinkles and/or coarse sugar., Transfer the baking sheet to the refrigerator and chill the shaped cookies for 20–30 minutes., Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C)., Bake the chilled cookies for 12–15 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The cookies will spread like all cookies do, but not completely lose their shape, especially if you chilled the shaped dough. If the cookies are smaller, they will take closer to 12 minutes. Keep your eye on them. They’re done when the edges lightly brown., Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely., Optional Chocolate, You can melt the chocolate in a double boiler or the microwave. If using the microwave: place the chopped chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Melt in 20-second increments in the microwave, stirring after each increment until completely melted and smooth. Dip the cookies in chocolate and top with sprinkles, if desired. Allow the chocolate to set completely at room temperature for about 1 hour or in the refrigerator for 20 minutes., Plain cookies stay fresh in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.

If you have a cookie with no creamy middle filling (like a chocolate chip or sugar cookie), then you can put them straight into the food processor. If you do have a filling (like an Oreo or Nutter Butter would), then you’ll want to open the cookie and scrape out the filling with a butter knife first.You want a dry crumb to work with, so the filling has to be removed. Some cookies have a solid middle that you can’t open and get to (like a Milano cookie), but I think that would be OK since the chocolate chip cookies have some chocolate bits mixed in and they turned out fine. Place your cookies into the food processor and blend until it forms a very fine powder. You’ll need 2 cups, so just keep blending cookies until you get there (since all the cookies are different sizes or have two sides per cookie, the number of cookies needed won’t be the same)., In a small saucepan, heat the butter over low heat until melted, and then stir in your sweetened condensed milk and evaporated milk until it’s all melted together. Starting with 1/2 cup of the liquid, pour it into your cookie crumbs and mix together with a spoon. Keep adding small amounts of the liquid until the cookie butter is just wet enough to stay together. Depending on how dry the cookie is to begin with, you’ll need more or less liquid. Really buttery cookies (like the sugar cookies) didn’t need nearly as much as the drier Oreo cookies, so just keep checking and stirring as you add the liquid., Once your cookie butter is blended, allow it to cool in the fridge for an hour or two. If you want to, you can actually stop at this point, and it will taste delicious.But if you want to make the cookie butter smoother and easier to dip things in, then remove the cookie butter from the fridge and stir very small amounts of water (start with 1/8 teaspoon) into the dough. At first it will look like the water is separating from the dough, but just keep stirring and mashing.You should start to notice that the cookie butter loosens up a bit as you stir in more water. Keep adding and stirring until you get to a consistency you like and refrigerate the mixture again., Store your cookie butter in the fridge and it should be good for at least a week or two.

Use an electric mixer to cream the butter and sugar together for a few minutes till light and fluffy., Add the egg, vanilla, and orange zest to the bowl. Beat again till creamy and well mixed., Sift flour and salt into the bowl.Mix with the electric mixer on low speed till a crumbly dough forms., Begin to knead dough with hands till a smooth dough ball forms. Try not to overwork the dough, only knead till the dough is the right consistency. If the crumbles are too dry to form a smooth dough, add water slowly, 1 teaspoon at a time, using your hands to knead the liquid into the dough. Knead and add liquid until the dough is smooth and slightly tacky to the touch (not sticky), with a consistency that is right for rolling out. It can easily go from the right consistency to too wet/sticky, so add water very slowly. If the dough seems too wet, knead in a little flour till it reaches the right texture., Form the dough into a flat disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator to chill for 3 hours to overnight., Before you begin to assemble the hamantaschen, choose and make your filling and have it on hand to work with. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly flour a smooth, clean surface. Unwrap the dough disk and place it on the floured surface. The dough will be very firm after chilling., Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thick. At the beginning, it will be tough to roll out-- you may need to pound it a bit. A heavy rolling pin works best. As you roll, cracks may form on the edges of the dough. Repair any large cracks with your fingers and continue rolling.When the dough reaches 1/4 inch thickness, scrape the dough up with a pastry scraper, lightly reflour the surface, and flip the dough over. Continue rolling the dough out very thin (less than 1/8 of an inch thick). The thinner you roll the dough, the more delicate and crisp the cookies will turn out-- just make sure that the dough is still thick enough to hold the filling and its shape! If you prefer a thicker, more doughy texture to your cookies (less delicate), keep the dough closer to 1/4 inch thick. Lightly flour the rolling pin occasionally to prevent sticking., Use a 3-inch cookie cutter (not smaller) or the 3-inch rim of a glass to cut circles out of the dough, cutting as many as you can from the dough.Gather the scraps and roll them out again. Cut circles. Repeat process again if needed until you've cut as many circles as you can from the dough. You should end up with around 35 circles (unless you've kept your dough on the thicker side, which will result in less cookies)., Place a teaspoon of filling (whichever filling you choose) into the center of each circle. Do not use more than a teaspoon of filling, or you run the risk of your hamantaschen opening and filling spilling out during baking. Cover unused circles with a lightly damp towel to prevent them from drying out while you are filling., Assemble the hamantaschen in three steps. First, grasp the left side of the circle and fold it towards the center to make a flap that covers the left third of the circle.Grasp the right side of the circle and fold it towards the center, overlapping the upper part of the left side flap to create a triangular tip at the top of the circle. A small triangle of filling should still be visible in the center., Grasp the bottom part of the circle and fold it upward to create a third flap and complete the triangle. When you fold this flap up, be sure to tuck the left side of this new flap underneath the left side of the triangle, while letting the right side of this new flap overlap the right side of the triangle. This way, each side of your triangle has a corner that folds over and a corner that folds under-- it creates a ""pinwheel"" effect. This method if folding is not only pretty-- it will help to keep the cookies from opening while they bake., Pinch each corner of the triangle gently but firmly to secure the shape. If any cracks have formed at the places where the dough is creased, use the warmth of your fingers to smooth them out.Repeat this process for the remaining circles., When all of your hamantaschen have been filled, place them on a lightly greased baking sheet, evenly spaced., Place them in the oven and let them bake at 350 degrees for 10-25 minutes, until the cookies are cooked through and lightly golden. Start checking them at 10 minutes; because the dough thickness tends to vary on these cookies they can cook quite fast if rolled thin. In most ovens it will take around 15-20 minutes, but best to keep a close watch over them as they cook to avoid overcooking or burning.Cool the cookies on a wire rack.

It takes 30-45 minutes at room temperature to soften butter properly. You’ll know your butter is perfectly softened when your fingertip leaves a slight indentation, but the stick still holds its shape. The Betty Crocker Test Kitchens also has a quick solution for softening butter, without melting it, for those times when taking the butter out to soften isn’t top of mind. Simply remove butter from packaging, place in glass bowl and cover with a damp paper towel and plastic wrap. Heat on high. For the quantity of butter called for in this recipe, you should cook for one minute and let the butter stand for two minutes. If necessary, repeat the process once more. Properly softened butter will ensure your cookies don’t spread too much, and they come out as soft, pillowy mounds of chocolate-studded love!

Divide dough in half and place each onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Wrap each up tightly and pat down to create a disc shape. Chill discs for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory for this cookie dough. I always chill mine overnight., Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.) Set aside., Remove 1 disc of chilled cookie dough from the refrigerator. Generously flour a work surface, as well as your hands and the rolling pin. Roll out disc until 1/4-inch thick. Tips for rolling—the dough may crack and be crumbly as you roll. What’s helpful is picking it up and rotating it as you go. Additionally, you can use your fingers to help meld the cracking edges back together. The first few rolls are always the hardest since the dough is so stiff, but re-rolling the scraps is much easier. Cut into shapes. Place shapes 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Re-roll dough scraps until all the dough is shaped. Repeat with remaining disc of dough., Bake cookies for about 9-10 minutes. If your cookie cutters are smaller than 4 inches, bake for about 8 minutes. If your cookie cutters are larger than 4 inches, bake for about 11 minutes. My oven has hot spots and yours may too—so be sure to rotate the pan once during bake time. Keep in mind that the longer the cookies bake, the harder and crunchier they’ll be.

Roll the dough 1/8"" to 1/4"" thick; the thinner you roll the dough, the crispier the cookies will be. Flour both the top and bottom of the dough if it starts to stick. Alternatively, place the dough on parchment, and put a sheet of plastic wrap over it as you roll, pulling the plastic to eliminate wrinkles as necessary when rolling; this will keep dough from sticking without the need for additional flour., Cut out shapes with a floured cookie cutter, cutting them as close to one another as possible to minimize waste., Transfer the gingerbread cookies to ungreased baking sheets (or, if you've rolled right onto the parchment, remove the dough scraps between the cookies).

Add the brown sugar and mix until well creamed together, about 1 minute. Add the molasses and mix until combined. Add the dry ingredients, and mix until a dough forms. Add 1-2 tsp of milk if your dough is a bit crumbly (see photos above)., Roll and Chill: Divide the dough into two halves, and roll each one out to 3/8"" thickness between sheets of parchment paper. (Use a ruler to check this, or just eyeball halfway between 1/4 and 1/2 inch. This is the perfect thickness for these cookies - trust! Even 1/2"" is perfect - but don't go lower than 3/8"") Place the rolled dough, still sandwiched in parchment paper, on a baking sheet and cover loosely with a clean kitchen towel. Chill for 1-2 hours in the fridge or shorter in the freezer, until completely chilled and firm., Cut out Cookies: Preheat your oven to 350° F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Cut shapes out of the chilled dough and place cookies a couple of inches apart on your prepared baking sheet. If the cookies are no longer firm and cold to the touch from working with the dough, pop the pan back in the fridge or freezer for 5 to 15 minutes to re-chill so that the cookies hold their shape when baked (it's fine to bake them from frozen).While the cookies are baking, combine your dough scraps, roll back out, and cut out more cookies. Repeat this until all remaining dough is gone! You will need to chill the dough for a bit again once you roll the scraps back out so that it's firm enough to cut the shapes easily. (Roll it back out between the parchment each time to keep things easy.), Bake: Bake cookies for 8-9 minutes. The cookies should appear just set, and will look a tad puffy. The centers may look a tad underdone. Don't be tempted to over bake them! They will set up to the perfect soft baked cookies. Let them cool on baking sheet for about 10 minutes before and transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling. Tip: Bake a single test cookie first if you’re worried you’ll underbake them - you’ll see that 8 minutes yields the perfect cookie!, Decorate: Decorate by dipping the cooled cookies in this glaze (swap the maple syrup for milk, if desired), dusting them with powdered sugar, or piping them with royal icing., Make Royal Icing: Combine all ingredients in a large bowl, starting with 4 tablespoons of water, and mix on high speed with an electric mixer for about 1 and 1/2 minutes. When the icing is the right consistency, you should be able to drizzle some of it into the bowl, and watch it sit on the surface of the mixture for 5-10 seconds before melting back in. If it's too thick, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time. If it's too thin, beat it for another 30 seconds to a minute, or add a bit more powdered sugar, a little at a time, beating between each addition. Add the royal icing to a piping bag fitted with a wilton #1 or #2 tip (I used a #1 for my cookies) and pipe desired designs. You can even use gel food coloring to tint the royal icing. While the icing is still wet, sprinkle on a little white sanding sugar (optional, but that is what I used in the photos above)., Serve + Store: Enjoy cookies once decorated! Be sure to let the icing set completely before storing. Store cooled, set cookies in an airtight container at room temp for 4-6 days., Cookie Dough and Cookie Make-Ahead Tips: The dough can be made, rolled out, and covered well and stored in the fridge for 1-2 days before baking. The cookies can be baked, cooled, and stored in an airtight container at room temp for 1-2 days before decorating. Royal Icing Make-Ahead Tips: The royal icing can be made and stored in the fridge in an airtight container for 1-2 days before using, or leftovers can be stored in this same way and used for other decorating within 1-2 days. Simply re-mix for about 10-20 seconds with a mixer to loosen things back up after being in the fridge. The same guidelines from above can be used to adjust the icing's consistency.","[('butter', 1.0, 'cup'), ('brown sugar', 1.0, 'cup'), ('molasses', 0.5, 'cup'), ('flour', 3.0, 'cup'), ('ginger', 2.5, 'tsp'), ('cinnamon', 1.5, 'tsp'), ('nutmeg', None), ('baking soda', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('salt', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('powdered sugar', 2.0, 'cup'), ('meringue powder', 1.5, 'tbsp'), ('water', 4.0, 'tbsp')]"

Use one half of the dough to make traditional cookies as directed on the package (these will be used as decoration elements) and use the other half of the dough to create a cookie base for your cake. If using two pans, split the dough in two.

I found it best to use a large decorating tip., Place the decoration in the fridge until firm. If you won’t be using them until the next day, store them in an airtight container so they don’t dry out., Using a high speed blender, simply break the frozen bananas into small chunks and pulse to start breaking them up., Add the carob powder and blend on high speed until smooth, scraping the sides often., If your blender is struggling, allow the mixture to warm slightly and try again or add a teaspoon of water at a time and try blending again. Be careful not to add too much water., Spread the chocolate banana ice cream in the pan and return to the freezer until firm or overnight., Mix the carob and coconut oil until it is completely smooth., Remove your cake from the freezer, remove the spring form pan ring, place your cake on a cake plate and remove the parchment ring from the sides., Drizzle the chocolate shell over the cake or pour it along the edge and allow it to run down the sides. Be aware that it solidifies quickly so try not to pour too much in one spot or it will be too think and difficult to get a fork through to eat., If you’re using the optional decorative icing, remove it from the fridge and allow it to warm slightly while you continue., Continue decorating your cake by arranging the frozen chocolate covered banana bites on the top of your cake.It looks nice to cut some in half., Used some of the Carob’Out Fudge Cookies as decorations – beak some in chunks and crumble others so you have lots of different textures., If you’re using the optional decorative icing you’ll find once it has warmed up a little that it’s pliable and you can quite easily arrange it around the base of the cake.

You should get about 80g or about ⅓ cup of raspberry juices., Return the raspberry juices to the saucepan and add the lemon juice. Set aside until needed., In a heat-proof bowl, whisk together the sugar, egg, egg yolk and salt until slightly fluffy and paler in colour (no need to use a stand or a hand mixer for this, just whisk them briefly together by hand with a balloon whisk)., Cook the raspberry-lemon juice mixture over medium heat until it only just comes to a boil (but don't allow too much moisture to evaporate, remove it from the heat as soon as it comes to a boil)., Add the hot raspberry juices to the egg-sugar mixture in a slow drizzle, whisking constantly until you've added all the juices.Tip: This tempers the egg and egg yolk, and prevents your raspberry curd from splitting or curdling when you cook it., Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook it over low heat with constant stirring until thickened so that it thickly coats the back of a spoon or spatula. This should take about 4-6 minutes. Don't allow the raspberry curd to come to a boil – you shouldn't see any bubbles forming., Once thickened, remove from the heat and stir in the butter until it's fully melted. Add the vanilla and mix well., Pour the finished raspberry curd into a bowl or heat-proof container and cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap/cling film. Make sure that the plastic wrap/cling film is in direct contact with the surface of the raspberry curd – this will prevent skin formation. Allow it to cool completely to room temperature, then chill it in the fridge for at least 1 hour or until thickened. (You can also prepare the raspberry curd a day or two in advance and keep it in the fridge until needed.), Lemon cookie dough:, Add the sugar and lemon zest to a large bowl, and use your fingertips to rub the zest into the sugar. Tip: This helps to release more essential oils from the zest, and it will make your cookies even more lemony and aromatic., Add the melted butter, eggs, lemon juice and vanilla, and whisk well until combined., In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder and salt, and add them to the wet ingredients., Mix with a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula until you get a smooth, batter-like cookie dough.Tip: At this stage, the cookie dough will really be more like a batter – it will be very loose, soft and sticky, bordering on runny. That's how it should be. Don't add more flour!, Chill the cookie dough in the fridge for at least 2 hours before proceeding to the next step. You can also keep it in the fridge overnight if you want to bake the cookies the next day.Tip: In addition to firming up the cookie dough into something you can actually handle and shape into balls, chilling also ensures that the cookies won’t melt into puddles during baking., Assembling & baking the cookies:, Adjust the oven rack to the middle position, pre-heat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC) and line two large baking sheets with parchment/baking paper.Tip: You will bake the cookies in two batches, so you can line two baking sheets if you have them on hand. Otherwise, just re-use the same baking sheet, but make sure to cool it completely before you place the next batch of unbaked cookies onto it., Use a 2-tablespoon cookie or ice cream scoop to scoop out a portion of the cookie dough. Drop it directly into a bowl of powdered/icing sugar and roll it around until it’s evenly coated. The sugar coating will allow you to handle the cookie dough without it sticking, so you can roll it between your palms to form a perfectly round ball.Repeat with the rest of the cookie dough, you should get 16 cookies in total., Place the sugar-coated cookie dough balls onto the lined baking sheets, with plenty of space between them, about 8 per baking sheet (as the cookies will spread during baking)., Use a ½-tablespoon measuring spoon to make an indent in the centre of each cookie dough ball (make sure that you press only halfway through each cookie dough ball, not all the way through)., Fill the cookies with about 1 (generous) teaspoon of raspberry curd.Tip: Note that you won't use up all of the raspberry curd. You can use the remainder to serve with the cookies, or you can spread it on bread or cakes, swirl it into frosting or similar., Bake one baking sheet at a time at 350ºF (180ºC) for 9-12 minutes or until the cookies have spread and cracked around the edges and the raspberry curd centre is slightly puffed up but NOT visibly bubbling (this will ensure that it stays beautifully smooth and creamy).While the first batch of cookies is baking, keep the second baking sheet with the cookies in the fridge until needed., The cookies will be very soft and delicate immediately out of the oven. Allow them to cool on the baking sheet for about 5-10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely., These raspberry curd lemon cookies are amazing both warm and at room temperature, but I find them to be at their very best when they're chilled from the fridge., Storage:, The gluten free raspberry curd lemon cookies keep well in an airtight container at room temperature for 2-3 days, or in the fridge for up to about 1 week., You will have some raspberry curd left over – you can store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to about 10 days.","['(raspberries', 150.0, 'g'), '(lemon juice', 30.0, 'g'), '(sugar', 75.0, 'g'), '(egg', 1.0, None), '(egg yolk', 1.0, None), '(salt', 0.25, 'tsp'), '(butter', 55.0, 'g'), '(vanilla bean paste', 0.5, 'tsp'), '(sugar', 150.0, 'g'), '(lemons', 2.0, None), '(butter', 115.0, 'g'), '(eggs', 2.0, None), '(lemon juice', 30.0, 'g'), '(vanilla bean paste', 0.5, 'tsp'), '(flour', 240.0, 'g'), '(xanthan gum', 0.5, 'tsp'), '(baking powder', 0.5, 'tsp'), '(salt', 0.25, 'tsp'), '(sugar', 90.0, 'g')]"

You will want to stir or swirl the pan frequently to keep it from burning. The butter will foam and bubble up along the process, just keep stirring/swirling and move the foam aside from time to time to check the color. The butter will turn an amber/brown color and will smell nutty and toasted when it’s ready {about 7-10 minutes}. Pour melted butter and all the browned bits into a heat proof bowl to cool and solidify back to room temperature {about 1 hour}., In a medium size bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, cornstarch, espresso powder and kosher salt.

The cookies should not spread a lot and I can fit 12 on a half sheet pan., Bake 8-10 minutes, until edges are lightly browned and crisped. They may look slightly underdone in the centers. Once the pan is removed from the oven, drop the pan hard on the counter one time. This helps to give the edges a little crinkle and deflates the cookie a little.

Cover and place one of the in the refrigerator while you roll out the other one., Place a sheet of parchment paper on a clean flat surface. Place one portion of the dough on the parchment paper, then place another sheet of parchment on top of it. If you are using standard cookie cutters, roll out the dough until it is 1 cm thick (if you go too thin, the cookies won’t be soft and will be crisp instead. Better to err on the side of a bit thicker than a bit thinner!) If you are using the wooden mold cookie cutters linked in this post, roll it out to be 2 cm thick.

Refrigerate both rolled out sheets of dough for 1 hour or until nice and firm., Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Remove one sheet of dough from the fridge and place it on a clean surface. Peel back the top layer of parchment paper and lay it on a baking sheet. Cut out the cookie shapes and place them on the lined baking sheet, giving about 1 inch of space between cookies., Place the baking sheet in the center rack of the preheated oven. The baking time will depend on the size of the cookie. For thicker cookies or cookies that are larger than 3 1/32 inches across, bake for about 8 minutes. For cookies that are smaller than 3.5 inches in diameter or have a lot of exposed edges, like snowflake shaped cookies, bake for about 6 minutes.

Bake until golden and firm on the edges with a bit of give in the centers, about 12 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely—they will feel soft but will crisp all the way through as they cool., In a small bowl, combine the egg white, powdered sugar, vanilla and salt. Mix with an electric hand mixer until smooth and thick. You could also do this in a medium bowl by hand. Whip in 1 teaspoon of eggnog until smooth, adding a bit more as necessary. To frost the cookies, working 1 at a time, kiss the tops lightly to the surface of the icing. Don’t fully submerge the cookies to allow some golden cookie to show through the icing., Let the excess icing drip off for a moment, and then set the iced cookie on a wire rack. Before the icing on the cookie sets, sprinkle with a pinch or two of ground nutmeg. If the icing in the bowl begins to firm while you’re dipping, loosen it with a few drops of water. Allow the icing to dry completely before serving, about 1 hour., Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.","[('oats', 150.0, 'grams'), ('sugar', 170.0, 'grams'), ('flour', 64.0, 'grams'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('baking soda', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('baking powder', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('cinnamon', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('nutmeg', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('butter', 0.5, 'cup'), ('egg yolk', 1.0, None), ('egg white', 1.0, None), ('powdered sugar', 150.0, 'grams'), ('vanilla bean paste', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('eggnog', None, None), ('nutmeg', None, None)]"

You never need cups, just the scale and bowl and make sure to zero out in between each ingredient., I use this scale.","Preheat the oven to 350°F and line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper., To a large bowl, add the oats, oat flour, coconut, baking soda, salt and chai spice blend and whisk very well until thoroughly blended., To the same bowl, add the syrup, cashew butter and almond butter and mix for a good couple of minutes until the batter becomes very thick and sticky. If your batter seems to be a tad loose after mixing a couple of minutes, add the extra 2 tablespoons of flour. Your batter will be determined by the thickness of your nut butters. Warning: the batter is addictive., Chill the batter for a minimum of 30 minutes in the fridge before baking. This will help the cookies to hold their shape better and puff up more., After chilling, add about 2 tablespoons worth of batter to the cookie sheet using a cookie scoop, spaced 2 inches apart, as they will spread a ton. 10 for each sheet., Fill a small bowl with water and dip your fingertips in the water to press down each cookie to 1/2 INCH (no less) thick. The batter will be way too sticky to do without dipping your fingers in water. Don't press them down too flat or they will over-bake and spread out too much-they will flatten out as they cook. Repeatedly dip your fingertips as needed, shaking excess water off and press and form the edges of the cookies into a round shape. Remember, the better you shape them, the more uniformed they will bake up, as they will bake up in the shape your form them in., Bake for 12-13 minutes. They should have puffed up and spread beautifully and have a nice warm, golden color. Remove and leave to cool on the pan for 10-15 minutes, so the bottoms firm up. Transfer them using a thin metal SPATULA to cool on a wire rack. Don't remove them with your hands or they will tear on the bottoms. It's important to let them cool for the first 10 minutes, as they firm up a lot as they cool, otherwise they are too crumbly while warm., You may need to bake them the first time to see if you would like them baked another minute or two, as this will greatly vary depending on the climate, your oven and nut butters used. I like to leave mine stored on the cookie rack with a towel covering them.

Cream together with an electric mixer until soft and fluffy., Next, add in the flax egg and vanilla and whip together another 30 seconds., Then, add in the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Make sure to add the flour first and then add the other ingredients on top. Then, use a fork to gently sift the baking soda and salt into the flour. Once sifted, mix everything together until a thick cookie dough forms. The dough will be slightly sticky, but should not be wet., Cover the bowl of cookie dough with plastic wrap and add the bowl of dough to the fridge to chill for 1 hour., About 10 minutes before removing the dough from the fridge preheat the oven to 350F, line a baking tray with parchment paper, and fill a small bowl with the 2 Tbsp of granulated sugar., Remove the dough from the fridge and use a cookie scoop to scoop out 10-12 evenly sized cookies (about 45-50 grams per cookie). Roll into balls between your palms and then roll in the bowl of granulated sugar until the cookies are coated., Place each cookie at least 2 inch apart on the tray and do not flatten them as they will spread while baking. All of the cookies will not fit on one baking sheet, so I recommend baking 6 cookies at a time on one tray vs. putting two trays in the oven at the same time., Bake for 11-13 minutes until bottoms are lightly browned and the cookies are cooked through but have slightly soft centers (If making smaller cookies adjust baking time to 9-11 minutes). The cookies will continue baking after they are removed from the oven so the centers should still be soft, but not glossy or raw, when they are removed from the oven., Remove the cookie tray from the oven and immediately tap the tray on the counter to produce a more “wrinkly” cookie. For round cookies, use a round cookie cutter that is slightly larger than the cookie and swirl the cookies around inside to form them into a round cookie. This step will only work if you do it while the cookies are still warm., Then, let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5-10 minutes. The cookies will be soft and puffy out of the oven and will naturally deflate a little while cooling., After cooling, serve & enjoy!","[('vegan butter', 0.5, 'cup'), ('dark brown sugar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('cinnamon', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('cardamom', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('ginger', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('star anise', 0.125, 'teaspoon'), ('black pepper', 0.125, 'teaspoon'), ('flax egg', 1.0, None), ('vanilla bean paste', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('all-purpose flour', 1.0, 'cup'), ('salt', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('baking soda', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('granulated sugar', 2.0, 'tablespoons')]"

It will melt, then foam, then turn clear golden and some toasted speckles will appear. As soon as they do, remove the pan from the burner; the residual heat will be sufficient to toast the rest of the butter to a deep golden brown. Pour butter and all the toasty flecks into a medium bowl then transfer to the freezer., Chill the browned butter: We want to freeze the butter until it’s solid throughout but trust me, this speeds it up: Freeze the butter in the bowl for 30 minutes then give it a full stir, scraping down the sides, mixing the still melted parts in the center over the solidified chunks. Return to the freezer for another 30 minutes — it should now be totally solid throughout. Cut it into chunks, right in the bowl. No need to make them even., Heat your oven: To 300°F. Line an 8-inch square cake pan with parchment paper that extends up two sides. There is no need to grease it., Make the shortbread dough one of two ways:, In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment: Beat browned butter chunks, brown sugar, and salt together, scraping frequently, until evenly mixed. Add vanilla, water, and flour, and mix just until combined, scraping down the bowl again. This is the same order as for a hand mixer, but with a hand mixer, you’ll need the butter warmed to semi-soft first., In a food processor: Combine brown sugar, salt, and flour in the work bowl, pulsing a few times. Add cold browned butter chunks, vanilla, and water and pulse several times to chop the butter down into even smaller pieces. Then, run the machine until it is fully incorporated and comes together in a smooth mass, 1 to 2 minutes more, scraping down as needed for even mixing., Both methods: Transfer shortbread dough to prepared baking pan and your fingers to press it into an even, flat layer, then use an offset spatula to smooth the top., Bake the shortbread: For 30 minutes — it will not be fully baked yet — and remove from the oven just long enough to shape the shortbread., To create the diamond shape shown, use the back of a paring knife (yes, the dull side) or a bench scraper to make light line indentations barely 1/4-inch into the shortbread, about 1 inch apart. Then, at about a 45-degree angle from the first lines, make remaining indentations 1.5 inches apart. [Note: I absolutely never measure and it’s more intuitive than it sounds when you read the above.] Use a very thin, sharp paring knife (this is my go-to) to cut along these lines to the bottom of the pan. Use the back of a wooden skewer (the dull end) to dock the shortbread wherever it suits you (it’s for aesthetics) about 1/3 of the way into the cookie., Finish baking: Return the shortbread to the oven for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until more deeply golden at the edges. Let cool in the pan, or, if you’re impatient, let them cool for 10 minutes, and then remove them, using one of the extended sides of the parchment paper lining the pan to make it easier. Let shortbread cool completely, then separate the shortbread where they were cut. If needed, use your paring knife again to make clean separations., Squiggle with icing (optional): Space shortbread evenly out on a rack and place over a tray to catch drips. Place powdered sugar in a small bowl and add 1 tablespoon lemon juice, mixing to combine. We’re looking for a thick but drizzle-able consistency. Add all or part of remaining 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice if needed to achieve it. Transfer icing to a sandwich bag and snip a tiny bit of the corner off and drizzle the icing over the shortbread. Let set for one hour at room temperature., Do ahead: Shortbread keeps for 1 week, if not longer, at room temperature. It freezes well too, just wrap it tight, and don’t squiggle with icing until defrosted.","[('butter', 225, 'grams'), ('water', 1.5, 'tablespoons'), ('flour', 290, 'grams'), ('brown sugar', 145, 'grams'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('vanilla', 1, 'teaspoon'), ('powdered sugar', 60, 'grams'), ('lemon juice', 1, 'tablespoon')]"

Set aside.  , To brown the butter: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. After several minutes, the butter will sizzle and may spatter. Continue to cook the butter, swirling the pan regularly, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until it’s a dark golden brown color and brown bits start collecting at the bottom of the pan; the butter will have stopped sizzling and may also have a layer of foam on the surface.   ,     ,       ,   ,   , , Once the butter is browned, immediately pour it over the sugar mixture (be sure to scrape out the brown bits at the bottom) and whisk vigorously to combine; this helps dissolve the sugar slightly and creates the shiny surface of the baked cookies. (The mixture will stay lumpy and won't become smooth at this point.) Set the empty saucepan aside to cool slightly.   ,     ,       ,   ,   , , To make the tangzhong: In the same saucepan used to brown the butter, combine the milk with 3 tablespoons (23g) of the bread flour and whisk until no lumps remain.    ,     ,       ,   ,   , , Place the saucepan over low heat and cook the mixture, stirring regularly with a whisk and then a flexible spatula, until it’s thickened, paste-like, and starts to come together into one mass, about 2 to 3 minutes.   ,     ,       ,   ,   , , Remove from the heat and transfer directly to the bowl with the butter and sugar. Whisk until mostly smooth; some lumps of the tangzhong mixture are OK.    ,     ,       ,   ,   , , Add the eggs and vanilla and continue whisking until smooth.   ,     ,       ,   ,   , , Weigh or measure the remaining 2 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon (307g) bread flour by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Add the bread flour to the bowl with the butter and sugar, then add the baking powder and baking soda. Using a whisk or flexible spatula, stir until well combined and no dry spots remain.   ,     ,       ,   ,   , , Place the bowl, uncovered, in the refrigerator and allow it to cool for 10 to 15 minutes. , While the batter is cooling, use a serrated knife to roughly chop the chocolate into coarse pieces. Avoid chopping the chocolate too fine, as small pieces will melt when mixed into the dough.    ,     ,       ,   ,   , , Remove the dough from the refrigerator and fold in the chopped chocolate. Cover the bowl and return to the refrigerator for 24 to 72 hours to allow the flavors to intensify.   ,     ,       ,   ,   , , To bake the cookies: When you’re ready to bake, remove the chilled cookie dough from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for about 10 to 15 minutes to allow it to warm up slightly. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the center. , Scoop the dough into 85g to 90g portions; a level scone and muffin scoop works well here. If you’re scooping by hand, the mounds of dough should be about 2 1/4"" in diameter. To make smaller cookies (that are still generous in size), scoop the dough into 50g portions using a jumbo cookie scoop. , Arrange the scooped cookie dough on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them 3"" to 4"" apart. (Five dough balls fit perfectly on a half-sheet pan. The 90g cookies can be arranged in a 2-1-2 pattern; the 50g cookies can be arranged in a slightly staggered 4 x 2 pattern.) For consistently shaped cookies, roll each piece of dough into a smooth ball before baking.  ,     ,       ,   ,   , , Bake the large (90g) chocolate chip cookies for 18 to 22 minutes or the smaller (50g) cookies for 15 to 18 minutes, until the edges are set and the cookies are browned, rotating the pan halfway through baking to ensure even browning. (For best results, bake one pan of cookies at a time.) Remove the cookies from the oven and let them rest on the baking sheets until cool enough to handle, at least 15 minutes.   ,     ,       ,   ,   , , Storage information: Store leftover chocolate chip cookies, covered, for up to 5 days; their slightly crispy edges will soften and the cookies will maintain a soft texture.

In second large bowl, with an electric mixer, cream the sour cream and butter at low speed; add sugar, eggs, and vanilla & mix until combined. (It's okay if it's a little lumpy as long as no butter chunks are visible.) Gradually add the flour mixture to the sour cream mixture, mixing until well combined. Dough will be sticky. (If cookie dough is too thick for your mixture to handle, you can stir it by hand with a wooden spoon.) Divide dough onto two pieces of plastic wrap; flatten dough, wrap tightly, and refrigerate until chilled, 1-2 hours. (Make ahead tip: Dough may be made to this point and refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 1 month.), ROLL, CUT, & BAKE COOKIES:, Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. Generously flour your counter or work surface to prevent dough from sticking. Rub flour on the rolling pin. Put one of the chilled pieces of dough on top of the floured surface and sprinkle the top of the dough with more flour. Starting at the center, roll the dough out to one edge; return to the center and roll to the opposite edge. Continue rolling until dough is an even 1/4"" thick all over, sprinkling with additional flour, if needed, to avoid sticking. Dip cookie cutter in flour and cut out dough shapes. Transfer dough shapes to baking sheets. Continue rolling dough, cutting shapes, and adding to baking sheets until they are filled. Bake 2 sheets at a time for 8-10 minutes, rotating and switching pans half way through cooking time. Bake them just until they are baked all the way through but haven't started browning on the bottom. If a soft textured cookie is desired, it's very important not to over bake them. Transfer hot cookies to a baking rack to cool completely., MAKE-AHEAD TIP:, Cooled, unfrosted cookies may be stacked in a sealed container and stored at room temperature for up to 2 weeks; although the fresher, the better. Freezing them is recommended to maintain their freshness. Unfrosted cookies may be frozen up to a month., MAKE FROSTING:, Combine powdered sugar, softened butter, vanilla, and half of the evaporated milk in a large bowl. Use an electric mixer to combine ingredients on a low speed until its' a thick paste consistency and all of the lumps are gone. Gradually add remaining milk and continue mixing on medium speed until frosting is a smooth, silky, spreadable consistency. If it's still too thick, add more milk 1/2 teaspoon at a time until it's desired consistency. Mix in food coloring, if desired., FROST & STORE COOKIES:, Frost each cookie and decorate with sprinkles while frosting is still wet.

I recommend starting the ganache as the cookies bake!, In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners’ sugar and orange zest, then beat until combined, about 1 minute. Next, add the egg, egg yolk, vanilla extract, and salt. Beat on high speed until combined, scraping down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. Finally, beat in the flour on low speed until combined. The cookie dough will be soft., Lightly flour your hands, work surface, and rolling pin. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Roll each portion out onto a piece of parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat (I prefer the nonstick silicone mat) to about 1/4-inch thickness. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick., Stack the pieces, with parchment paper between the two, onto a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. If chilling for more than a couple hours, cover the top dough piece with a single piece of parchment paper., Once chilled, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Remove one of the dough pieces from the refrigerator and, using a 1.5-inch cookie cutter, cut into shapes. I used the 1.5 inch fluted round cookie cutter from this adorable set. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd dough piece.

Heat the cream in a small saucepan until it begins to gently simmer. (Do not let it come to a rapid boil—that’s too hot!) Pour over chocolate and let it sit for 2-3 minutes to gently soften the chocolate. Slowly stir until completely combined and chocolate has melted. Allow to cool and thicken for at least 30 minutes or until spreadable consistency., Spread the ganache onto the flat side of one cookie and sandwich with the other.

(You can use a flexible spatula to mix by hand, as well.) Add the egg and vanilla and mix until mostly combined (it will look curdled at first but keep mixing), another 1 minute., Add the flour mixture and mix on low just until a smooth and pliable dough forms and no dry streaks remain, about 30 seconds, taking care not to overmix. Transfer to a sheet of plastic wrap and use it to shape the dough into a 6-inch square. Transfer to the freezer until firm but not solid, about 30 minutes., Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper., Have ready a small bowl of flour or place a mound on your work surface. Divide the dough into 16 equal pieces (about 40 grams each) and roll into balls. Working with one piece at a time, dust the ball with flour and place inside the mooncake mold. Press down on the mold firmly, against the counter, and slowly release and remove the stamped cookie. Repeat with the remaining dough, transferring the stamped cookies to the sheet pan, spacing at least 1 inch apart., If you don’t have a mooncake mold, on a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough until it is about 1/4-inch thick. If the dough is too cold and firm to roll out, allow it to soften on the counter for a few minutes. Cut out 2 1/2-inch round or square cookies with a cookie cutter or knife, and knead and roll out the scraps to cut more cookies, spacing these at least 1 inch apart on the baking sheet., Bake 17 to 19 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool on the sheet pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely., Make the glaze: Once the cookies are cool, in a small shallow bowl, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar and orange juice until smooth and runny. To test the consistency of the glaze, dip a cookie into it or use a small pastry brush to paint the cookies. You will have reached the right consistency when glaze stays on the stamped cookie without obscuring its pattern. If the glaze runs off and you can see too much of the cookie under it, the glaze is too thin. If it’s too thick, add 1 teaspoon of orange juice; if it is too thin, add an additional 1 to 2 teaspoons of confectioners’ sugar. (If making simple cut-out, flat cookies, the glaze consistency is less temperamental.) Dip or paint the remaining cookies in the glaze and allow any excess to run off.

Meanwhile, coarsely chop 3 ounces dark chocolate (heaping 1/2 cup) and place in a small microwave-safe bowl., Step 2: Make the cookies:, Finely grate the zest from 5 medium oranges (about 2 tablespoons) into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Add 1 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Pulse in short bursts until the sugar turns a bright yellow color and is very fragrant, about 30 seconds., Step 3: Make the cookies:, Add the butter and 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil. Process until the butter becomes fluffy and loose in consistency, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1/4 cup sour cream and pulse until combined, about 10 (1-second) pulses., Step 4: Make the cookies:, Transfer 1 cup of the batter to a medium bowl. Add 1 cup of the all-purpose flour to this batter and mix with a flexible spatula until an orange dough forms., Step 5: Make the cookies:, Melt the chocolate in the microwave on high in 15-second intervals, stirring between each. Add the chocolate to the remaining batter in the food processor. Sift 2 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa powder over the batter. Pulse, stopping and scraping down the sides of the food processor as needed, until combined and a glossy and smooth batter forms, about 10 (1-second) pulses., Step 6: Make the cookies:, Add the remaining 1 cup all-purpose flour to the food processor and pulse until combined and the dough forms a ball around the blade, about 15 (1-second) pulses., Step 7: Make the cookies:, Place the chocolate dough in between 2 sheets of parchment paper. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a rough 8 1/2 x 11 1/2-inch rectangle about 1/2-inch thick., Step 8: Make the cookies:, Remove the top layer of parchment paper and reserve for baking. Evenly dollop the orange dough over the chocolate batter. Using a spatula or your hands, spread the orange dough into an even layer. Grasping the parchment, slide the cookie dough sheet onto a baking sheet or large plate. Refrigerate until slightly hardened but still malleable enough to push your finger into and make a dent, 8 to 10 minutes., Step 9: Make the cookies:, Slide the dough sheet, still on the parchment, onto a work surface and position with a longer side closer to you. Make 3 parallel cuts, spaced evenly apart, across the dough so that you are left with 4 (2 1/8 x 11 1/2-inch) strips. Slide a long offset spatula or metal bench scrape under the strips to help loosen them, then stack the strips on top of each other. Gently press down on the stack to ensure all the layers are sticking to each other., Step 10: Make the cookies:, Freeze until fully hardened, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with the reserved parchment paper., Step 11: Make the cookies:, Using a knife or bench scraper, trim off the rough edges for the stack of dough. (Don’t throw away the scraps: press them together to form a marbled cookie dough, chill it, slice it, and bake at the end.), Step 12: Make the cookies:, Working quickly to keep the dough as cold as possible, cut the dough crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. If some cookie dough layers fall apart as you’re slicing, simply push them back together. Arrange the cookies on the baking sheet, spacing them at least 1 inch apart., Step 13: Make the cookies:, Bake until the cookies are light golden-brown on the bottom, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely before making the toppings., Step 1: Make the toppings:, Finely grate the zest from 1/4 medium orange (about 1/8 packed teaspoon) into a small bowl. Add 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and rub the zest into the sugar with your fingers until the sugar is fragrant and yellow in color., Step 2: Make the toppings:, Coarsely chop 4 ounces dark chocolate (about 3/4 cup). Transfer heaping 1/2 cup to a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave on high in 15-second intervals, stirring between each, until melted and smooth. Add the remaining chocolate and stir until all the chocolate is melted and smooth., Step 3: Make the toppings:, Dip each cookie halfway into the melted chocolate and return to the baking sheet. Freeze until the chocolate is almost set, 2 to 3 minutes. Immediately sprinkle the chocolate-covered side with the orange sugar and flaky salt.

That's how it should be. Don't add more flour!, Chill the cookie dough in the fridge for at least 2 hours before proceeding to the next step. You can also keep it in the fridge overnight if you want to bake the cookies the next day.Tip: In addition to firming up the cookie dough into something you can actually handle and shape into balls, chilling also ensures that the cookies won’t melt into puddles during baking., Shaping & coating the cookies:, Adjust the oven rack to the middle position, pre-heat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC) and line 2 large baking sheets with parchment/baking paper.Tip: You will bake the cookies in several batches, so you can line 2 baking sheets if you have them on hand.

I like to scoop portions of the cookie dough with a 1 tablespoon measuring spoon that I've dipped in a bit of powdered/icing sugar beforehand. This prevents the cookie dough from sticking to the spoon and makes the whole process easier and faster.Tip 2: If the cookie dough sticks to your hands as you go to roll it into a ball, you can lightly dust your hands with a bit of powdered/icing sugar as well. This will prevent sticking., Roll each ball first in granulated sugar and then in powdered/icing sugar until it's fully coated.Tip: Rolling the cookies in granulated sugar first results in the prettiest cookies, with a lovely white coating of powdered sugar that cracks to give a beautiful random pattern., Baking:, Place the cookie dough balls on the lined baking sheets, at least 1 ½-2 inches (4-5cm) apart.

A word about the butter, we use Sweet Cream Salted Butter when we are baking and I think it tastes great with these sugar cookies too. The butter needs to be softened but still cold. A prime culprit for dry sugar cookie dough is butter that is too warm and soft. I let the butter sit out on the counter for just under an hour before I start making the cookies - this seems to be the perfect amount of time for me. The butter is still cold to the touch but you can press into the stick with your fingers. In the past, when in a rush, I have softened the butter in the microwave but inevitably the dough that I get is on the ""crumbly"" side., Cream the butter and sugar until it is completely mixed (3 minutes on medium-high should do the trick.), Add 2 tablespoons of vanilla and 2 eggs. I know that sounds like a lot of vanilla but this recipe needs a little extra moisture and the cookies will taste great., Mix the cookie dough until light and fluffy (about 3 more minutes.), Add 4 teaspoons of Baking Powder and mix., Mix in the 6 cups of flour two cups at a time. Don't over-mix the dough when you are adding the dry ingredients. Mix it only until the flour is incorporated into the dough., After you have added the 6 cups of Flour the dough should be firm but not dry or crumbly. If the dough seems to dry, add a tiny bit of vanilla or milk (start with a teaspoon) and mix again., Roll a handful of the dough out on a prepared surface until it's about 3/8"" thick., Cut out shapes with cookie cutters., Bake in an oven pre-heated to 350 degrees for 6-10 minutes depending on the size of the cookie cutter you used. Do not over-bake! We like thicker sugar cookies so they will hold a good amount of frosting. If you make your cookies on the thick side as we have done in the pictures here, you should cook them 9-10 minutes. They might not look done to you but they are. Take them out of the oven. You don't want them to start browning around the edges the way a Chocolate Chip Cookie would, for example. The cookies should be set and just bet starting to slightly brown around the edges. Over-baking is the prime culprit if you feel your sugar cookies seem dry. If you roll out thinner cookies, or use smaller cookie cutters than the ones we have used here, you should only bake the cookies 6 or 7 minutes., Let your cookies cool and then they are ready for frosting. We use our Best Buttercream Frosting recipe with these Best Sugar Cookies. The frosting is easy to color and tastes so delicious and yummy on these Sugar Cookies.

Stir in orange zest and vanilla. Chill the mixture, covered with plastic wrap, while you make the cookies., Make the cookies, Sift flour and baking powder into a large bowl. In another bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar until combined. Whisk in milk, melted butter, salt and lemon zest until smooth. Fold the dry ingredients into wet in 2-3 additions, until well incorporated., Finish mixing the dough with your hands and press it into a ball. If it's very sticky add another tablespoon or two of flour until it sticks together, but not more than that. The dough should be smooth and soft., Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for 15 minutes (or even a few hours), this makes handling it easier. As you get ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C - see notes for more) with a rack in the center of the oven. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside., Roll the dough into 2 logs, slice each log into into 44 pieces and shape each one into a smooth ball. Transfer them to the prepared baking sheets, placing them 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart, as they will rise during baking. Press down each ball slightly, so the bottom flattens., Bake the first round for about 10 minutes, until bottoms are golden brown (the tops will remain pale). Rotate the pan halfway through baking. As you take the first tray of cookies out, put the second one in the oven., While the cookies are still warm, cut a circle in the bottom of each cookie and scoop out enough of a cookie for it to hold some filling. (Be careful, don't pierce the cookie too deep or you risk breaking it.) Set the scooped out cookies aside., Repeat the process with the second tray of baked cookies. Next, find a pair for each cookie, you want the halves of the peach to be of similar size. Choosing them at this stage is easier than finding one mid-filling., Assemble the cookies, Combine rum (or juice) with food dye (follow instructions on the package) in a small bowl. Add a tablespoon of water (or juice) to dilute the mix a bit. Also put sugar in another shallow bowl., Fill each cookie hole with enough ricotta filling that it covers it completely (about a teaspoon). Press the two flat sides of each filled half together, so the filling comes out at the ""seam"" and swipe away the extra filling., Brush each peach with food coloring, gently roll it in sugar and place on a large plate. Continue with the rest of the cookies., Chill cookies, covered with plastic wrap, for a few hours before serving. This will harden the ricotta and moisten the cookies.

You don't need to line it if it's non-stick; otherwise, lie a sheet of baking parchment on it., Stir the flour, cocoa, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and fine sea salt together in a small bowl just to combine them., In a slightly larger bowl — I use a pudding basin that I now can't look at without thinking of these cookies — vigorously beat the butter, both the sugars and the vanilla with a small wooden spoon until you have a buff-coloured and creamy mixture. If you aren't a messy person, you could use a cereal bowl for this., Add a generous spoonful of the dry ingredients to the creamed butter and sugar and beat it in gently with your wooden spoon. Then — still gently, unless you want cocoa and flour all over the place — beat in the rest of your dry ingredients, in about three batches. Once the dry ingredients are absorbed, you can beat vigorously until you have a sticky, rich-brown dough, that clumps together, at which point you can stir in the chocolate chips., It's not often I demand this level of precision, but I now weigh this mixture, and divide it in two; you don't need to be fanatical about this, a few grams here or there won't make the difference.

I crouch by the oven, staring through the cloudy glass door feeling like, as the old Joan Rivers joke has it (and forgive me if you've heard me tell this before), Elizabeth Taylor shouting 'Hurry!' at the microwave., Once the surface is cracked, and the cookies have spread, they are ready. They will, however, feel very soft — even uncooked — to the touch, and you will doubt me. But I will forgive you, as long as you obey me. So whip out the baking sheet, leaving the cookies in place for 5 minutes. Only then may you slip a metal spatula under the cookies and tenderly transfer them to a wire rack. For optimal eating pleasure, leave for another 10 minutes before biting into one.

Lay one strip of your puff pastry in front of you, on your work surface, horizontally. Make note of where the center of the strip is., Take the right end, and loop it so that it lands on the center of the strip., Place a finger on each side of the loop. This is to make sure that the krakeling has its characteristic shape, and there is even spacing all around., Take the left end, and loop it around your fingers, until you get the right shape. You may have to stretch the dough a little, Push the dough down gently with the palm of your hand., Place the krakeling on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet, with the looped ends facing down., Repeat this with all your strips of dough., Rest the krakelingen in the fridge for 10 minutes., Sugaring the Krakelingen, Line your work surface with some parchment paper, and put a layer of sugar down., Lay 3-4 krakelingen on the sugar, lengthwise, pointing away from you., Sprinkle a layer of sugar on top of the krakelingen., With a rolling pin, gently roll over the cookies. You want to make sure the sugar adheres to the dough, and elongate the krakelingen by approximately 1.5 to 2 times., Shake off any excess sugar, and place them back on the parchment paper-lined cookie sheet, with the looped ends facing up., Repeat for the remaining krakelingen., Rest the cookies in the fridge for 30 minutes., Baking the Krakelingen, Preheat your oven to 175ºC (350F) in convection mode., Put the krakelingen in the oven, and let them bake for at least 15 minutes before checking them., Check the cookies, and rotate the cookie sheet if necessary. (In our oven, the back is hotter than the front, so rotating them makes it so the back ones don't burn)., Bake them for another 5 - 10 minutes, or until they're golden brown, and the sugar starts to melt. Be careful, if you leave them in too long, the sugar can burn! Sugar goes from nicely caramelized to burnt quickly., Remove the cookie sheet from the oven, and transfer the krakelingen to a rack for cooling., When they are fully cooled, you can store them in an airtight container for several days.

Put the browned butter in a medium bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, scraping in brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the remaining 1/2 cup butter to the bowl and let sit 10 minutes to let the browned butter cool. While the butter cools, measure out the rest of your ingredients., Make the dough: Add 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup granulated sugar into the butter and beat in using a stand mixer or hand mixer — low speed at first so butter doesn’t fly everywhere, then increase to medium high — until creamy and increased in volume by 50% or so, about 6 minutes.

Immediately out of the oven, use a round container with 4- to 5-inches diameter, like a deli container or a mason jar lid or a ring mold, and use the edge of the container to gently push the edges of the cookie toward its center. Once the cookie is “squished” up enough to fit inside the container, swirl the cookies around the inside of the container to get them perfectly round. Sprinkle with a little flaky sea salt and let rest on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, then place on a rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough.

Spread the cherries in a single layer in a small, rimmed baking dish or pan. Sprinkle with the sugar and 2 tablespoons of the bourbon. Roast the cherries in the oven, giving the pan a shuffle every 5 or 10 minutes, until they are oozing juice and beginning to collapse and look like prunes, 20-30 minutes. Watch them closely so that the juices don’t burn. Remove from the oven and let cool., When the cherries are cool enough to handle, pit them (I do this with my fingers, breaking each cherry in half and removing the pit). Be sure to save all the precious juice. Chop the cherries coarsely – you want them in roughly quarters or eighths. (This can be messy, so wear an apron!) Combine the chopped cherries, their juice, and the remaining tablespoon of bourbon in a jar and chill., Ice Cream:, In a medium saucepan, warm the milk with the vanilla bean pod and scrapings, sugar, and salt over medium heat until it steams and small bubbles form on the bottom of the pan, swirling occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat, cover the pot, and let steep 10-20 minutes., Meanwhile, place the egg yolks in a medium bowl, and set the bowl on a damp towel. Place the heavy cream in another heatproof medium bowl and set a fine mesh strainer over the top., Re-warm the milk until steamy hot. Whisking constantly, dribble the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks. Pour the mixture back into the pot and set it over a low flame. Stir the custard constantly with a heat-proof silicone spatula, scraping the bottom and corners of the pot well, until the custard thickens slightly and/or registers 170º on an instant-read thermometer. This will only take a few minutes., Immediately strain the custard into the cold cream. Return the vanilla pod to the custard, and chill until very cold, at least 4 hours and (preferably) overnight or up to 2 days., Remove the vanilla pod from the ice cream base (you can rinse it, let it air-dry, and stick it in a bottle of booze or a jar of sugar). Place the ice cream base in the freezer for 30 minutes to get it really cold, stirring once halfway through. Place the cherries in the freezer, too., Churn the ice cream base in your ice cream maker until it is the texture of a thick milkshake. Gently swirl in the chilled bourbon cherries and their liquid. I like to do this by hand with a spoon, so that the ice cream retains a marbled look of burgundy streaks on white, rather than becoming uniformly pink. Scrape the ice cream into a storage container and freeze until firm, 2-3 hours. For longer storage, press a piece of parchment paper directly to the surface of the ice cream., Cookies:, Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350ºF. Line 2 rimless cookie sheets with parchment paper., Place the butter in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan set over the lowest possible heat. Add 6 ounces (170 g / 1 cup) of the chopped chocolate and melt together, stirring frequently to prevent the chocolate from scorching. Continue cooking until the mixture is pleasantly warm, but not super hot, to the touch. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Whisk together the buckwheat flour and baking powder in a small bowl and set aside., Meanwhile, place the eggs, sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whip on medium-high speed until the mixture triples in volume and is very light and fluffy, 5 minutes. Turn the mixer to low and stir in the vanilla until just combined, then the warm (bot not too hot!) chocolate/butter mixture. Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed until combined. Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a flexible silicone spatula to fold in the remaining 4 ounces (115 g / 3/4 cup) chopped chocolate., If the batter is very runny, let it cool for a few minutes until it firms to the consistency of a thick brownie batter. Use a #40 spring-loaded ice cream scoop or 2 spoons to drop heaping tablespoons of batter onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart. Top each cookie with a few chunks of chocolate and a few flecks of flaky salt., Bake the cookies until puffed and cracked and the edges are set, 7–10 minutes, rotating the pans front to back and top to bottom halfway through baking. Let cool completely on the pans, then transfer to a smaller baking sheet lined with parchment paper, placing the cookies in a single layer to as not to mar their crackly tops, and freeze until ready to assemble., Sandwiches:, Let the ice cream soften until scoopable, 5 minutes, then use a spring-loaded #24 ice cream scoop to form rounded scoops (about 1/3 cup each) of ice cream, placing each one on a chilled baking sheet lined with parchment in the freezer as you go. Chill the scoops until firm, 20 minutes., Remove the cookies from the freezer and divide into pairs of similarly-sized cookies, Then form sandwiches with the scoops of ice cream, gently pressing down on the cookies to squish the ice cream scoops (you may need to let the scoops soften so the cookies don't break when you press them down). Return each sandwich to the freezer when shaped., Store the sandwiches in an airtight container in the freezer, or wrap each in plastic wrap and store in a zip-top bag.

It should be very golden brown in colour. Don’t be conservative – the dark brown gives the cookies tonnes of flavour and weight is important here. Weigh it once browned – it should weigh 130g or close to that.

Add your chopped chocolate, and use the spoon to combine as best you can., Then, use your hands to form into 8-10 balls, with an even dispersion of chocolate.

When measuring the flour, spoon it into the measuring cup and level it with the back of a knife instead of scooping it with the measuring cup, as scooping it will compact the flour and create too dense of a cookie., Cream together the wet ingredients with the granulated sugar in a separate (large) bowl., Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in thirds, mixing each third in well before adding more. I use a hand mixer for this, but you can do it by hand with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon if needed. A large dough ball will form once all of the ingredients are combined. Kneed it with your hands if necessary to form it into a ball., Cut the dough ball in half and wrap each half in parchment paper (not wax paper, which is different). Working in halves just makes it easier to roll out. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, and up to 24 hours., When you’re ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 375° F and remove the two dough balls from the refrigerator, and let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes, which will soften it a little and help it roll out., There are two methods you can choose from to roll out the dough. I prefer to place the dough between to pieces of parchment paper (again do not use wax paper as it will melt in the oven). I use parchment paper 1) so I don’t have to use extra flour to roll out the dough, 2) so I don’t have to grease the baking sheets, and 3) for easy cleanup! You can bake the cookies right on the bottom piece of parchment paper and just put the cookie trays away once they’ve cooled. If you prefer the more traditional method, use your gluten-free flour to flour your work surface and rolling pin, then roll out your dough per normal. Either method you choose, roll out your dough to about 1/8 of an inch in thickness. Thicker dough will yield a softer cookie, and thinner dough will yield a crunchier cookie., Use a cookie cutter to cut your dough into any shape you like. Or, use the top of a pint glass to make round cookies. When cutting the dough, get your cookie cutter shapes as close together as possible. If you’re using parchment paper, just remove the scraps, and leave the cutouts where they are, and transfer the parchment paper to a baking sheet., Bake for 9-11 minutes until the edges are just slightly golden. Try not to let the bottom brown a lot if you want a soft cookie. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, and immediately lift the parchment paper & cookies onto the counter as leaving it on the baking sheet will continue to cook them., Let cool completely before frosting.

Allow to cool for 5-10 minutes. Add the sugars and whisk well to combine. Add the eggs, vanilla, and white vinegar, and whisk until smooth and combined, about 30-45 seconds. Add the red food coloring and whisk in. You'll have a vibrant red - this will become muted after adding the dry ingredients. Stir in the dry ingredients, adding the white chocolate chips last. (It will seem like the dough isn't going to come together at first but it will - it takes some elbow grease! Or, you can get out your mixer for this step.), Scoop & Chill: Scoop the dough into balls that are 65 grams in size. This is about 2.5 tbsp each. Place cookie dough balls into an airtight container lined with parchment paper (to prevent sticking) and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or freeze for at least 30 minutes. Make-Ahead Tip: Cookie dough balls can be chilled in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days, and can be frozen for up to 2 months. Bake from frozen, adding 1-2 minutes to the second part of the bake time as needed., Bake Cookies: Preheat your oven to 400 ℉. Place 5-6 cookies on a parchment paper lined baking sheet, and bake one at a time. Bake for 4 minutes at 400℉, then turn the temp down and bake at 365℉ for 4 to 5 minutes.This will give you a nice crisp exterior, while keeping the cookies soft and gooey on the inside. The edges will appear and feel just set, and the tops will seem fairly set as well. For perfectly round cookies, swirl each cookie inside of a round cutter (or use an upside down glass) as soon as they come out of the oven. If the cookies move on the baking pan easily, that's a good sign they're fully baked!Place cookie sheet on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes or so, then transfer cookies to cooling racks to cool completely before frosting. Or dig in once they've had a chance to cool for 10-15 minutes!, Make Cream Cheese Frosting: In a medium bowl, beat together the butter, powdered sugar, cream cheese, vanilla, and salt until combined and creamy. Don't over mix! If your frosting became a bit weepy, pop it in the fridge or freezer to quickly firm back up., Decorate Cookies: Use a small cookie scoop to drop balls of frosting onto each cookie, then use an offset spatula to spread it out, leaving the edges of the cookie visible. Place the heart cookie cutter in the center, and fill with sprinkles. Tap out the excess, then remove the cookie cutter., Serve & Store: Once cookies are decorated, enjoy immediately! Or, store cookies in an airtight container in the fridge until ready to enjoy. Frosted cookies must be stored in the fridge, and will keep in an airtight container for 4-5 days. Unfrosted cookies can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for 4-5 days.","[('butter', 206.0, 'grams'), ('sugar', 156.0, 'grams'), ('sugar', 163.0, 'grams'), ('eggs', 2.0, None), ('vanilla extract', 1.5, 'tsp'), ('white vinegar', 10.0, 'ml'), ('food coloring', 7.0, 'drops'), ('flour', 374.0, 'grams'), ('cocoa powder', 22.0, 'grams'), ('baking soda', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('baking powder', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('salt', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('white chocolate chips', 1.0, 'cup'), ('butter', 57.0, 'grams'), ('cream cheese', 8.0, 'ounces'), ('powdered sugar', 2.0, 'cups'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('salt', None), ('cookie cutter', 1.0, 'small'), ('sanding sugar sprinkles', None)]"
