Change your seasonings and cheese depending on the menu. Change out of few options and add taco seasoning to your cheese plus some red pepper flakes for a Tex Mex option. Fresh or dried basil and oregano add an Italian flare.","Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Very generously grease a 9- or 10-inch Bundt pan with butter. The good amount of butter is going to give the rolls a nice golden color and extra flavor. I used a dark non-stick Bundt pan and 350F degrees was perfect, so don't feel you need to lower the temperature unless your oven runs hot., Place your desired herbs and cheeses into small dipping bowls. I used about ½ cup of each. Again, see below for tips and ideas for delicious herb and cheese options., Stir 3 minced garlic cloves into melted butter. Cut each biscuit in half and roll into a ball. Complete this step before you start dipping in butter because if your hands are greasy, the rolls won't stay intact., Dip each biscuit ball in butter and garlic mixture. Some of the garlic should adhere to the rolls as you do this. As you start to run low on the butter, more of the garlic will stick, so don't worry if it doesn't as much at the beginning. Roll each ball in desired coating and arrange the biscuits in the pan so the various coatings are alternated., Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until biscuits are done and surface is golden. I highly recommend laying a sheet of aluminum foil on top of the biscuits at around 25 minutes to prevent the top from getting too brown too fast., Cool in pan for 5 minutes. Run a thin, soft rubber spatula around the edge and down the sides of the pan to loosen any stuck cheese, if necessary. Invert onto a plate, then lay serving platter on top and flip bread over onto serving platter., Recipe Tips:, You can assemble the monkey bread up to a day ahead of serving. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and then remove from refrigerator while oven is preheating., Any type of refrigerated dough can work here, like flaky version rolls. Just make sure the total amount used is 32 ounces.","[, (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, m, i, l, k,  , b, i, s, c, u, i, t, s, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', 1, 6,  , o, z, ., ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, a, r, l, i, c,  , c, l, o, v, e, s, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', p, a, r, s, l, e, y, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', p, i, n, e,  , n, u, t, s, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', c, r, a, n, b, e, r, r, i, e, s, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', b, l, a, c, k,  , p, e, p, p, e, r, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', p, o, p, p, y,  , s, e, e, d, s, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', c, h, e, d, d, a, r, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, a, r, m, e, s, a, n, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, a, p, r, i, k, a, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', b, a, s, i, l, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', o, r, e, g, a, n, o, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ]"

5c4f36a2,https://www.thetastiestbook.com/savory-monkey-bread-gruyere-scallions-bacon/,"Savory Monkey Bread with Gruyere, Scallions, and Bacon","4 cups (512 g) unbleached all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 2 teaspoons sugar, 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast, 2 cups lukewarm water, 6 slices bacon (finely chopped), 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, softened, plus more for greasing, 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, 1 tablespoon poppy seeds, 1 cup (120 g; 4 ounces) grated Gruyere cheese, 1 cup (120 g; 4 ounces) grated mozzarella cheese, 1/3 cup (40 g; 1-1/2 ounces) grated Parmesan or other hard aged cheese (divided), 1/4 cup (32 g) unbleached all-purpose flour (more as needed), 5 green onions (white and light green parts, thinly sliced (about 1/2 cup))","Dough, Combine the flour, salt, sugar, and instant yeast together in a large bowl using a whisk or rubber spatula. Stream in the lukewarm water and use a rubber spatula to mix everything together. After a few minutes, the liquid should be absorbed and the ingredients will form a sticky ball of dough. Cover the bowl loosely with a damp (but clean) kitchen towel or piece of plastic wrap and set aside in a warm spot to proof for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, until doubled in bulk., Assembly, While the dough undergoes the first rise, prep the other components of the monkey bread. Heat a medium/large skillet over medium-low heat and cook the bacon until the fat renders and the bacon is crisp, about 10-15 minutes. Place the cooked bacon on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess drippings., In a small bowl, stir together the softened butter, Dijon mustard, and poppy seeds until combined. Grate or shred the mozzarella and Gruyere, transfer to a medium bowl, and stir to combine the cheeses., Grease a 10 or 12-cup Bundt pan or a 3-quart Dutch oven with a generous amount of butter. Grate the Parmesan cheese and scatter half (roughly 1/6 cup) of the grated Parmesan on the bottom of the greased Bundt pan. Reserve the other half for later., Set a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 F., Once the dough has approximately doubled in size, spread 1/4 cup of flour out onto a clean work surface or large cutting board. Use two forks to separate the dough into two, and lift one half of the dough out of the bowl and onto the flour-dusted work surface. Dust your hands and the exterior of the dough, then shape the (very sticky) dough into a rough ball. Divide the ball into roughly 14-16 equal pieces, each about the size of a golf ball. Using the minimal amount of flour required to prevent the dough from sticking, loosely form each small piece into a ball and transfer them to the pre-greased pan until the bottom is filled. This should take about 10 pieces., Top this layer of dough pieces with 1/3 of the butter mixture, 1/3 of the bacon, 1/3 of the sliced green onions, and 1/3 of the mozzarella/Gruyere cheese. Add the remaining ~4-6 dough balls on top, then repeat the step above to form balls from the remaining dough (you may need to add more flour). Finish covering the butter-bacon-onion-cheese layer with dough balls, which should require another 6-8 balls., Top the second layer of dough balls with 1/2 the remaining butter mixture, followed by 1/2 the remaining bacon, 1/2 the sliced green onions, then 1/2 the mozzarella/Gruyere. Cover this layer with the remaining dough balls. You won't have quite enough to fully cover up the cheeses, just distribute the dough balls evenly. Cover the third layer of dough with the remaining butter, bacon, green onions, and mozzarella/Gruyere, then scatter the reserved 1/6 cup of grated Parmesan evenly on top., Let the dough rise in a warm spot, uncovered, for about 20-25 minutes until the dough balls puff up slightly. [Alternatively, you can also cover the pan with plastic wrap at this point at refrigerate it up to 12 hours prior to baking. Remove it from the fridge (and remove the plastic wrap) while the oven pre-heats.], Bake the assembled monkey bread in the preheated oven for 40-44 minutes, until the cheese bubbles along the edges and the top is golden brown. Remove from the oven, let it cool for 5-10 minutes, then invert onto a large plate and serve immediately., Monkey bread is best eaten immediately, but any leftovers can be stored, tightly wrapped, in the refrigerator for a few days or the freezer for up to a month. Rejuvenate by reheating at 300 F until warmed through.","[, (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 5, 1, 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, a, c, o, n, ', ,,  , 6, ., 0, ,,  , ', s, l, i, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 4, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, u, s, t, a, r, d, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, o, p, p, y,  , s, e, e, d, s, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, r, u, y, e, r, e,  , c, h, e, e, s, e, ', ,,  , 1, 2, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, o, z, z, a, r, e, l, l, a,  , c, h, e, e, s, e, ', ,,  , 1, 2, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, a, r, m, e, s, a, n,  , c, h, e, e, s, e, ', ,,  , 4, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, r, e, e, n,  , o, n, i, o, n, s, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, o, u, n, t, ', ), ]"

Place over medium heat and cook, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens into a paste. Remove from heat and transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer., BREAD DOUGH, Add the cold milk and mix to combine, checking with your finger that it is not hotter than lukewarm (the cold milk should cool the hot tangzhong enough). Add the sugar, yeast, milk powder, salt, flour, and oil. Transfer the bowl to the mixer and fit with the dough hook., Mix the dough on medium speed until it is smooth and elastic and clearing the sides of the bowl, about 12-15 minutes. Don’t freak out, as it is sticky - if you have made it by weight you will be fine. Set a timer and walk away from the mixer if you need. If after that time it really isn’t coming together and you’re worried, add flour a teaspoon at a time just until the dough just comes together., The dough should be smooth and elastic, and pass the windowpane test., Turn the dough out onto a surface and flour or oil very lightly if needed to bring into a tight ball with a bench scraper.

Roll each piece into a ball and place into a bowl., Add the Filippo Berio Grilled Vegetable Pesto and gently stir until the balls of dough are completely covered with pesto., Transfer the balls of dough to the prepared pan, arranging so that they sit in a single layer., Cover the dough balls with half of the cheese (15g), sprinkling it evenly over the top., Lightly cover the pan with plastic wrap and leave the dough to rise in a warm spot until almost doubled in size, approximately 30-45 minutes (this depends on your environment). This can be slightly hard to tell, but look for how far it rises up the sides of the pan. You can also leave one little patch slightly exposed so you can do the press test. When dough is properly risen, it will spring back lightly leaving a little indentation when gently pressed with a finger., Toward the end of the rising process, preheat your oven to 350°f / 180°c., Sprinkle the monkey bread with the remaining 15g of grated parmesan., Bake the monkey bread for 20 to 25 minutes, until the bread is baked, springs back when pressed, and the cheese on top is golden brown. It can be slightly hard to tell when the bread is done because of the cheese - If you like you can also take the internal temperature, which should read at 190°f / 90°c (this is an additional measure of doneness)., Remove the monkey bread from the oven and leave to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing.

The bread pudding needs to sit a while so the custard will soak into the dried bread.

6c71ed7e,https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-cheese-bread/,Homemade Cheese Bread - Extra Soft,"1/2 cup (120ml) buttermilk, warmed to about 110°F, 1/3 cup (80ml) water, warmed to about 110°F, 2 and 1/4 teaspoons Platinum Yeast from Red Star (1 standard packet), 2 Tablespoons (25g) granulated sugar, 5 Tablespoons (71g) unsalted butter, melted + slightly cooled, 1 large egg, at room temperature, 1 teaspoon salt, 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 3 cups (390g) bread flour (spooned & leveled), plus more as needed and for hands/work surface*, 2 cups (250g; 8 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese (see note), 2 Tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter, melted, 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley (or your favorite dried or fresh herb)*, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder","Prepare the dough, Whisk the warm buttermilk, warm water, yeast, and sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes., Add the butter, egg, salt, garlic powder, and 1 cup flour. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula, then add the remaining flour. Beat on low speed until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes. *If you do not own a mixer, you can mix this dough with a large wooden spoon or silicone spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle!*, Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st Rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1.5-2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter. Takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), Grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan., Shape the bread, Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and with a floured rolling pin, roll the dough out into a 9×15-inch rectangle (approximately). Sprinkle cheese all over the top, leaving a 1/2 inch border uncovered., Watch the video above to see exactly how I do this step. Tightly roll the dough into a 15-inch log. Place the log on its seam. Using a sharp knife, cut the log in half lengthwise. I find a serrated knife works best. Criss-cross one half, cut side down, on top of the other half—forming an X. Tightly twist the two together. Pinch the outer edges to seal as best you can. If you have any leftover cheese, cut a few small squares and tuck into the dough as shown in the video above. This is optional and simply for extra cheesy pockets! Place in prepared loaf pan and cover with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. (This step can get a little messy.), Allow the covered loaf to rest for 30 minutes. It will slightly rise during this time., Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position. Place a baking sheet on the lower rack to catch any cheese or butter that may drip down. Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C)., Topping, Whisk the melted butter, herbs, and garlic powder together. Drizzle or brush on top of dough., Bake until golden brown and, when gently tapped, the top of the loaf sounds hollow, about 45-55 minutes. If you find the top of the loaf is browning too quickly as it bakes, tent with aluminum foil. (I usually place foil on top after about 25 minutes.) Remove bread the oven and place on a wire rack. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then remove from the pan and cool loaf on the wire rack., Slice and serve. Cover and store leftovers at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Leftover slices taste delicious when warmed in the microwave for 10 seconds.","[, (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 3, 3, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, l, a, t, i, n, u, m,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, a, r, l, i, c,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 7, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, h, e, d, d, a, r,  , c, h, e, e, s, e, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, a, r, s, l, e, y, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, a, r, l, i, c,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ]"

(If too oily and wet, you may have added the butter too quickly — it’s okay, but the gluten won’t form right.), Allow to rise for about 2 hours at room temperature, covered with plastic wrap. The dough should double in size., Break the dough into somewhat consistently-sized balls, 1-2-inches in diameter. Dough is sticky and may not form tight balls; that's okay., Dip one side into the toasted sesame seeds then place each seed-side up, into a buttered large loaf pan. Continue until all of the balls are coated and in pan. Place balls in an even layer, but haphazardly., Cover and allow to rise for 40 minutes., Start preheating your oven 20 minutes before you plan to bake, to 375 degrees., Sprinkle top with sea salt and bake in middle of oven for 50-60 minutes. Top will be golden brown when done., Allow to sit in loaf pan for about 10 minutes to cool before removing. It is a little fragile (sesame seeds may dislodge and the bread crumb may separate a little), so take care when removing from pan. The butter content helps it slide right out. Drizzle top with a little melted butter (though the sesame seeds may flake off -- a butter atomizer may be the trick to prevent this) and serve warm. Present on a platter like a centerpiece so that all at the table may pull off pieces of bread with an audience., If cold, reheat in oven at 300 degrees for about 10 minutes before serving. This bread freezes well if wrapped tightly in foil.","[, (, ', s, e, s, a, m, e,  , s, e, e, d, s, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', d, r, y,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, o, t,  , w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ]"

43875e88,https://sugarspunrun.com/homemade-bread-recipe/,Homemade Bread,"2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast¹ (1 packet), 1 ¼ cups water, ¼ cup whole milk², 2 Tablespoons + 1 teaspoon granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons salt, 2 Tablespoons butter (softened and cut into 4 pieces), 4 - 5 cups bread flour or all-purpose (plain) flour³","Combine milk and water and heat in the microwave (or on the stovetop) until it reaches a temperature between 105-115F (40-46C). Make sure to stir the liquid before measuring the temperature to make sure it is heated evenly., Pour warm milk/water mixture into a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Add yeast and 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar and stir to combine. Allow to sit for about 5 minutes, until yeast is foamy (if yeast does not foam there is something wrong with it, it is likely dead. You will have to throw this out and start over)., Once yeast is foamy, add remaining 2 Tablespoons granulated sugar, salt, butter, and 2 cups (250g) of your flour mixture. Stir well until completely combined (the butter may not be completely combined at this point but as you add more flour it should mix into the dough completely)., Gradually add additional flour, stirring well after each addition (if you are using a stand mixer, stir on low-speed with a dough hook attachment), until dough clings together and forms a ball that pulls away from the side of the bowl. Dough should be slightly tacky to the touch but should not be sticky., Transfer to a clean surface and knead for about 5-10 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic (or continue to stir with mixer on low-speed with dough hook until smooth and elastic, about 3-5 minutes)., Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl, turn dough to coat the surface lightly with oil, cover and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in size (about 1-2 hours)., Once dough has doubled, transfer to a clean, lightly floured surface and use your hands to deflate the dough. Use lightly floured hands or a lightly floured rolling pin to form into an 8x12” rectangle. Starting with one 8” end, roll dough tightly into a log. Pinch the seam to seal the log and tuck the ends of the dough under to form a loaf (see my video below the recipe for a visual)., Transfer to a lightly greased (I use shortening) 9x5” bread pan. If desired, use a serrated knife to score the bread lengthwise across the top. Cover with a clean towel and allow to rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size and loaf has risen about .5-1” above the edge of the loaf pan. While dough is rising, preheat your oven to 400F (200C)., Once dough has risen and oven is preheated, oncover loaf and transfer to 400F (200C) oven and bake for 25 minutes or until loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped,, Immediately invert onto a cooling rack. Allow to cool a bit before slicing and serving.","[, (, ', a, c, t, i, v, e,  , d, r, y,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, h, o, l, e,  , m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, r, a, n, u, l, a, t, e, d,  , s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 3, 3, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r,  , o, r,  , a, l, l, -, p, u, r, p, o, s, e,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ]"
63a84f1a,https://pastrychefonline.com/savory-pumpkin-sage-bread/,Savory Pumpkin Sage Bread,"10 oz roasted pumpkin puree ((I used my own. You can also use canned)), 4 oz butter, melted and cooled to warm (1 stick), 26 oz bread flour ((I highly recommend King Arthur)), 2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast ((you can use Rapid Rise, too)), 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1 Tablespoon each minced sage and rosemary, 1 teaspoon dried poultry seasoning, 7-9 oz slightly warm water, 1 egg yolk combined with 1/2 teaspoon water, 9 sage leaves, 1/2 cup bread flour, 2-3 ice cubes per loaf","In the bowl of your stand mixer, whisk together the pumpkin and butter., In another large bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients, including the minced herbs., Dump the dry ingredients onto the pumpkin mixture., Add about 6 oz (3/4 cup) water to the bowl, fit your mixer with the dough hook, and mix for a good 3-4 minutes until there is no loose flour in the bowl and the dough is starting to come together. Remember, we want a really slack dough, almost more of a very thick batter (think about the consistency of pate a choux, but sproingier because of the gluten formation)., Add another 2 Tablespoons (1 oz) of water and mix (again with the dough hook) for another couple of minutes until the water is all absorbed into the dough. Things should be sticking quite nicely in the bottom of the bowl by now., Increase the mixer speed to medium and watch it for a minute or so. Lots of times, dough that sticks at lower kneading speeds magically clears the bowl at higher speeds. You should still have a ton of sticking in the bottom. If not, add another tablespoon (two, if necessary) of water and keep going., Once the dough is nice and slack, knead for ten minutes. You'll still have a bunch of dough stuck in the bowl, but some of it will also have climbed up the dough hook. Oil your fingers and stretch out a bit of the dough. If it stretches farther than it looks like it should, you're done., If your mixer bowl holds at least five quarts, you can let the dough rise right in your bowl. If your mixer is smaller, you'll have to let it rise in a different bowl., Use a bowl scraper to gather the dough into a ball at the bottom of the mixer bowl, or scrape it all out into another large, oiled bowl. With oiled hands, tuck the edges in and try to pull the top of the ball a little bit taut., Realize that all is going well, even if you're a little sweaty and unsure. Spray the top of the dough with some cooking spray or oil and cover the bowl with some plastic wrap., Heat up some water to boiling in the microwave. Move the mug to one corner of the microwave, add your covered bowl and shut the door. Let the dough proof for 1 1/2-2 hours. The dough will be up to the top of your bowl by then., Oil your hand, or a large silicone spatula, and press out the gases pretty thoroughly. Fold the dough over a couple of times to redistribute the yeast, then, form it into a rough ball again. Spray or brush oil on the top of the dough, Cover and let rise again for 1-1 1/2 hours, or until again doubled or even tripled., Preheat the oven to 425F and put a baking stone on a rack in the bottom third of the oven., Put a cake pan on the rack under the baking stone., Cut 3 squares of parchment and spray each with a bit of cooking spray., Oil your counter lightly. With oiled hands or an oiled bowl scraper, splorch the dough out onto the counter. Be gentle. At this point, you don't want to press out much of the air if you can help it., Cut the dough into three equal pieces (I weighed mine. I won't tell if you just want to eyeball it. Give your friend the smaller loaf and keep the bigger ones for yourself)., With oiled hands, form each piece into a rough round, gathering the excess dough underneath to keep the top somewhat taut. Place each rough round, gathered side down, on its own piece of parchment on a rimless cookie sheet, cookie shovel or pizza peel., Brush the back of a sage leaf with your egg yolk glue. Press it gently into place. Keep gluing and placing until you have 3 sage leaves glued onto each loaf., Liberally sprinkle flour all over the top of the loaves. Cover each loaf with plastic wrap and let sit out until puffy, about 30 minutes. The design on your bread won't be as defined now., Put two of the loaves in the fridge. Take the remaining loaf and sprinkle some extra flour right over the leaves., Take a pastry brush and gently brush off a fair amount of the flour. Make sure to brush any off the parchment, because it will burn in the oven., Carefully peel the sage leaves off., Slide the loaf, parchment and all, onto the hot baking stone., Toss 2-3 ice cubes into the cake pan underneath and quickly close the oven., Bring the second loaf out of the fridge to sit at room temperature while this loaf bakes., Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the internal temperature is right around 200F (195-205F is fine)., Remove loaf to a rack to cool., Repeat with the second loaf, bringing the third out of the fridge when that one goes in the oven., Cool the loaves to room temperature. Enjoy within a day or two. To keep longer, put in a freezer bag and suck out the air with a straw before sealing it. Freeze for up to a month. Thaw in the sealed bag until the loaf reaches room temperature.","[, (, ', r, o, a, s, t, e, d,  , p, u, m, p, k, i, n,  , p, u, r, e, e, ', ,,  , 1, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', o, z, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 4, ., 0, ,,  , ', o, z, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 2, 6, ., 0, ,,  , ', o, z, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', k, o, s, h, e, r,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, g, e, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', r, o, s, e, m, a, r, y, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, o, u, l, t, r, y,  , s, e, a, s, o, n, i, n, g, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, r, m,  , w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 9, ., 0, ,,  , ', o, z, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g,  , y, o, l, k, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, g, e,  , l, e, a, v, e, s, ', ,,  , 9, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', i, c, e,  , c, u, b, e, s, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ]"

Set aside., Whisk together the eggs in another small bowl and set aside., In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the butter and milk until melted. Remove from the heat and add water and vanilla extract. Let mixture stand for a minute or two, or until the mixture reaches 115 to 125 degrees F., Pour the milk mixture into the dry ingredients and mix with a spatula. Add the eggs and stir until fully incorporated. Add the remaining flour and continue to stir for about 2 minutes. The mixture will be sticky., Place the dough in a large, greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest in a slightly warm area until doubled in size, about 1 hour., While the dough rises, grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan., Once the dough has risen, add about 2 tablespoons of flour into the dough and knead it until it's deflated. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rest for 5 minutes., On a lightly floured work surface, use a rolling pin to roll the dough out to about 12-inches x 20-inches.

Sprinkle with all of the sugar and cinnamon mixture and top with the mini chocolate chips., Slice the dough vertically, into six equal-sized strips. Stack the strips on top of one another and slice the stack into six equal slices once again. You’ll have six stacks of six squares.

Add the yeast and 1 tablespoon granulated sugar. Whisk together until thoroughly combined and let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes., Add the remaining granulated sugar and the rest of the dough ingredients (butter through eggs) to the milk mixture, stirring everything until it comes together to form a shaggy ball. Then knead the dough by hand (or with a dough hook attachment) until it’s smooth and elastic - this will take about 10 minutes (or less if using a stand mixer). Shape dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and let it rise until doubled in size, 1-2 hours., While the dough rises, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a small bowl. Set aside., Grease a 9""x5"" loaf pan or pullman loaf pan (for a loaf with perfectly straight sides)., After the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll out dough to a 24""x12"" rectangle., Spread the butter over the dough in an even layer. Sprinkle the brown sugar filling over the butter., Using a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut dough lengthwise into 4 equal-sized strips. Stack the strips on top of one another and cut the stack into 6 equal-sized pieces., At this point, you can layer the dough stacks, cut sides up, neatly in the loaf pan. (It helps to tilt the loaf pan a bit to keep your stacks from folding over on themselves.) Or, for a messier look, cut each dough stack in half, stretch it into a rectangle, fold it in half and then place in the pan with the folded edge perpendicular to the bottom of the pan. It's OK if some stacks stick up higher than others., Cover loaf with a clean kitchen towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour., About 15 minutes before dough has finished rising, preheat oven to 350 degrees., Sprinkle top of loaf with sliced almonds, if using, and bake for 40-45 minutes until golden brown. If the top of the loaf gets too brown before it is done baking, cover loosely with foil., Remove pan from the oven and turn out bread onto a wire rack.

ee4cf42b,https://joythebaker.com/2011/03/cinnamon-sugar-pull-apart-bread/,Cinnamon Sugar Pull-Apart Bread,"For the Dough:, 3 cups all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 envelope) active dry yeast **, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 ounces unsalted butter, 1/3 cup whole milk, 1/4 cup water, 2 large eggs, at room temperature, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, For the Filling:, 1 cup granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground nutmeg, 2 ounces unsalted butter, melted until browned","In a large mixing bowl (I used just the bowl of my stand mixer) whisk together 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Set aside., Whisk together eggs and set aside., In a small saucepan, melt together milk and butter until butter has just melted. Remove from the heat and add water and vanilla extract. Let mixture stand for a minute or two, or until the mixture registers 110-115 degrees F., Pour the milk mixture into the dry ingredients and mix with a spatula. Add the eggs and stir the mixture until the eggs are incorporated into the batter. The eggs will feel soupy and it’ll seem like the dough and the eggs are never going to come together. Keep stirring. Add the remaining 3/4 cup of flour and stir with the spatula for about 2 minutes. The mixture will be sticky. That’s just right., Place the dough is a large, greased bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel. Place in a warm space and allow to rest until doubled in size, about 1 hour. *The dough can be risen until doubled in size, then refrigerated overnight for use in the morning. If you’re using this method, just let the dough rest on the counter for 30 minutes before following the roll-out directions below., While the dough rises, whisk together the sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg for the filling. Set aside. Melt 2 ounces of butter until browned. Set aside. Grease and flour a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Set that aside too., Deflate the risen dough and knead about 2 tablespoons of flour into the dough. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rest for 5 minutes. On a lightly floured work surface, use a rolling pin to roll the dough out. The dough should be 12-inches tall and about 20-inches long. If you can’t get the dough to 20-inches long… that’s okay. Just roll it as large as the dough will go. Use a pastry brush to spread melted butter across all of the dough. Sprinkle with all of the sugar and cinnamon mixture. It might seem like a lot of sugar. Seriously? Just go for it., Slice the dough vertically, into six equal-sized strips. Stack the strips on top of one another and slice the stack into six equal slices once again. You’ll have six stacks of six squares. Layer the dough squares in the loaf pan like a flip-book. Place a kitchen towel over the loaf pan and allow in a warm place for 30 to 45 minutes or until almost doubled in size., Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Place loaf in the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the top is very golden brown. The top may be lightly browned, but the center may still be raw. A nice, dark, golden brown will ensure that the center is cooked as well., Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 20 to 30 minutes. Run a butter knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the bread and invert onto a clean board. Place a cake stand or cake plate on top of the upside down loaf, and carefully invert so it’s right side up. Serve warm with coffee or tea., I think this bread is best served the day it’s made, but it can also we wrapped and kept at room temperature for up to 2 days.","[, (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 0, ., 3, 3, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, s, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', v, a, n, i, l, l, a,  , e, x, t, r, a, c, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, i, n, n, a, m, o, n, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', n, u, t, m, e, g, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ]"

Use a wooden spoon or dough spoon to mix the ingredients together., It will be sticky and dense to manage with a spoon. Let this sit for one hour. This is the autolyse stage. Once the hour has passed you will add the salt and let it sit another 30 minutes., Now you will do your first stretch and fold or coil fold. There are two different options. You can stretch and fold which means you pull the dough up from one corner and stretch it and then fold it over the top fo the dough, rotate and do the same action 4 times for the dough., Coil fold is where you lift the dough from underneath with two hands, pulling the dough up and then folding it down in half on itself as you let it back down. I You then rotate the bowl and repeat this 3 more times rotating the bowl each time.`, Let the dough rest another 30 minutes and repeat the coil fold or stretch and fold. (having wet hands makes this so much easier), Repeat this 3 -4 more times. You can do it up to 6 times., Once you are at this point you will notice the dough has a very different texture and should be very jiggly., Once it had doubled in size, its time to shape your dough and prepare it for the fridge! This is a bulk fermentation. This will make one large loaf or two smaller loaves., If you decide to make two, just divide the filling ingredients., Take your dough and roll it out onto a lightly floured surface. Using your fingers, stretch the dough into a rectangular piece that is about 10 by 13 inches wide or more if you are making one large loaf., Once you have it laid out add your filling ingredients. Sprinkle the brown sugar, cinnamon, rosemary and orange zest over the entire surface., Add the cranberries randomly on dough in an even pattern., Now, fold the sides in toward the center creating a thin shape. Now roll it up on itself to create a ball. Then use your hands and pull the dough towards yourself while creating a ball. This will help add surface tension to the outside of the dough. Be careful to not pull too hard and push all the filling toward the surface of the dough., Flour your banneton or proofing basket and lay your dough with the top side down. Cover with plastic or a towel and put it in the fridge overnight or for 12 hours., In the morning, preheat your oven to 425 degrees with a dutch oven in it., Once it is hot, get your bread out of the fridge and lay it on a piece of floured parchment paper. Use a sharp razor blade or bread lame to cut and score the surface of the dough., Put the dough with the parchment paper in the hot pan and cover with the lid (you do not have to have a lid but I think it makes it rise better), Bake for 25 minutes covered and then remove the lid and bake another 15 minutes uncovered until it is golden brown on top., When it is done, remove it and let it cool completely on a cooling rack before cutting., This tastes amazing with some cinnamon honey butter. You can also make french toast.

Do not over-mix at this stage, or the cookies may spread while baking. Add the egg and vanilla extract. Mix again on low speed, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl intermittently as needed., In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Add to the butter and egg mixture. Mix on low speed until a dough has formed and there are no longer any streaks of butter in the mixing bowl. (The dough will often clump around the paddle attachment while being mixed; this is normal and a good sign that the dough is the right consistency.) If your mixture does not come together and is crumbly, add ice-cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough clumps. The dough should be firm and malleable and easily rolled into a ball between your palms without sticking to your hands. If the dough is too sticky, add additional flour 1 tablespoon at a time., Roll the dough into a disk and cut away 1/3 of the dough. Return this 1/3 portion of dough to the mixer bowl and add the cocoa. Mix until well incorporated. Cover the brown dough with plastic wrap while you shape the rest of the dough. Roll the remainder of the dough into an 8-inch baton. Using an index finger, make an indention along the top center of the dough. Make indentions in the same way on both sides of the dough baton, about 1/2 inch from the top. This creates a bread top (crown) shape. Loosely wrap the baton in wax paper and transfer to the freezer. Chill until very firm, about 15 minutes., Meanwhile, roll the chocolate dough to 1/4-inch thickness between two sheets of parchment paper. When the plain dough is well-chilled, lightly brush the chocolate dough with egg wash and place the chilled dough on top of the chocolate dough; wrap a single layer of chocolate dough around it. Smooth the chocolate dough around the plain dough using your fingers to train it into the grooves and contours until there are no air bubbles between the two doughs. Cut away the excess chocolate dough and reserve for other use (or cut into shapes and bake)., Wrap the cookie dough loosely in parchment or wax paper and transfer to the freezer until partially frozen, about 15 minutes., Preheat the oven to 350°F., When the dough is chilled, slice the baton into 1/4 inch cookies with a large, non-serrated knife. Place the slices on parchment-lined cookie sheets and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cookies are fragrant and the surface has a matte appearance. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely., Buttercream Frosting, Combine the butter and powdered sugar in an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment. Add the powdered sugar and mix on low speed until combined. Mix in the extract. Add milk or cream as needed to bring to spreading consistency. Divide the frosting into two bowls and tint each with the food color; mix well until no streaks of white remain. Add a little of the yellow food color to the bowl tinted moss green, which will make it more similar to avocado color., Decorate, Spread the frosting onto the centers of some of the cookies. Leave others plain for fried egg decors, if you’re making them., Avocado Toast, Use a small fork to make tine marks in the avocado green buttercream; sprinkle on coarse crystal sugar for ‘salt., Buttered Toast, Spread yellow buttercream over toast, or quarter starburst candies and use as ‘butter pats’ affix them to the cookies with yellow buttercream., Egg Toast, Spoon small amounts of melted white chocolate into irregular oval shapes onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Immediately top each with one or two yellow Sixlets candies. Let firm and then affix them to cookies with a dot of yellow buttercream. Pepper can be created from the chocolate cookie portion of an Oreo, crush it fine between your fingers and sprinkle over the egg.

cc4f7cea,https://heathershomebakery.com/2023/11/20/cinnamon-sugar-star-bread/,Cinnamon Sugar Star Bread,"1 1/4 Ounce Pack of Instant or Dry Active Yeast ( .25 ounce if weighing), 1/4 Cup Dark Brown Sugar, spooned and leveled (not packed), 2/3 Cup Whole or 2% Milk, warmed to about 110°, 1/3 Cup Salted Butter, softened to room temperature, 1 Large Egg, room temperature, 1/2 Teaspoon Salt, 2 1/4 Cups All Purpose Flour, plus more for dusting and rolling the dough out, 1 Large Egg, beaten (for the egg wash), 1/2 Cup Salted Butter, softened to room temperature, 2/3 Cup Dark Brown Sugar, packed, 2 1/2 Tablespoons Ground Cinnamon, 1/2 Cup Salted Butter, melted, 1 Cup Powdered Sugar, sifted to remove any lumps, 2 Teaspoons Rodelle Pure Vanilla Paste, 2 Tablespoons Half and Half","Making the Star Bread:Secure your paddle attachment to your standing mixer. Into the mixer bowl, combine the yeast, brown sugar, and warm milk. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes, or until it becomes frothy.Next, add the softened butter, egg, salt and flour to the yeast mixture. With the speed on low, mix the dough for four minutes. Alternatively you can knead the dough by hand on a floured surface for about 5 minutes (or until it becomes smooth and elastic) if you do not have a standing mixer. Form it into a ball.Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 70-80 minutes or until it has doubled in size. I used my proofing oven at 85° and it was perfectly doubled in 75 minutes., Making the Filling:To create the delicious filling for your Starbread, start by combining ½ cup of salted butter that has been softened to room temperature in a bowl. Next, add ⅔ cup of dark brown sugar, whether it's light or dark is fine. Ensure that the brown sugar is packed for a rich flavor. Finally, incorporate 2 ½ tablespoons of ground cinnamon into the mixture, stirring until all the ingredients are well combined. This delightful filling is now ready to be generously spread onto the dough before you embark on the baking process. Get ready to enjoy the sweet and cinnamon-infused goodness of your Starbread!Now this filling will spread slightly out of the dough while it bakes, causing a delightfully caramelized bottom to the bread that is completely irresistible. It’s a tad messy, but oh-so worth out! If you prefer a clean finish, simply omit the butter in the filling and spread the cinnamon and brown sugar mixture over each layer. The goodness of cinnamon will still permeate each layer and be divine., Assembling the Star BreadPunch down the risen dough and divide it into 4 equal parts {I weighed mine and it was roughly 5.8 to 5.9 ounces per dough ball}. Roll out one portion of the dough into a circle about 10 inches in diameter on a floured surface.Place the rolled-out dough circle onto a parchment lined baking sheet.Spread 1/3 of the cinnamon mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.Repeat this process with the remaining 3 portions of dough, stacking them on top of each other with filling in between.Place a small 3” round object (like a glass or a small bowl) in the center of the dough stack to create a guide for the center of your star.Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the dough into 16 equal segments from the edge to the center guide.Remove the guide from the center.Take two adjacent segments and twist them away from each other three times, pinching the edges. Repeating this process for all pairs to create the star shape.Cover the star bread lightly and allow it to rest for 15 minutes. Preheat your oven to 350°F. Brush the beaten egg over the top of the star bread for a golden finish.Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and cooked through., Making the Vanilla Bean Glaze:When the bread is about halfway baked, make the glaze. Melt the butter in a microwave safe bowl on high for 30-45 seconds. Be cautious when removing as it could be hot. In a mixing bowl, combine the butter, sifted powdered sugar, Rodelle Natural Vanilla Paste extract, and 2 tablespoon of half and half. Whisk until you have a smooth glaze. If you prefer a thinner consistency, add one more tablespoon of heavy cream., Final Touch:Drizzle the vanilla bean glaze over the warm star bread or serve it on the size as a glorious dipping sauce. Serve immediately. Store any leftovers at room temperature in an airtight container for up to three days. Best serve day of. Refrigerate any leftover glaze. You can warm this up prior to serving., This delightful treat is perfect for sharing with friends and family on special occasions or as a cozy homemade snack, and courtesy of Rodelle! The layers of flaky dough and buttery cinnamon and sugar make it a showstopper. Serve it fresh out of the oven and watch it disappear.","[, (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, o, w, n,  , s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 0, ., 6, 6, 6, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 3, 3, 3, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, o, w, n,  , s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 6, 6, 6, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, i, n, n, a, m, o, n, ', ,,  , 2, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, o, w, d, e, r, e, d,  , s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', v, a, n, i, l, l, a,  , p, a, s, t, e, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, a, l, f,  , a, n, d,  , h, a, l, f, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ]"

Prepare two 9 by 5-inch loaf pans (or one 12 x 5-inch loaf pan by spraying generously with cooking spray. Set aside., Reserve a lengthwise half of a banana. Place the rest of the bananas in a medium bowl and use your hands to break them up into smaller chunks. Use a fork or a potato masher to mash these banana chunks until you have a chunky mixture. Set aside., In another medium bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Whisk together until the ingredients are fully combined. Set aside., In the bowl of a freestanding electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar and 2 large eggs. Beat on medium speed for around 2 minutes, until fluffy. Lower the mixer speed to its slowest setting and add 2/3 cup vegetable oil, 1/3 cup buttermilk, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon dark rum. Beat on medium-low speed for around 2 minutes, until well combined. Lower the mixer back to its lowest setting and add the mashed bananas (from the 2nd step). When all the bananas have been added, sprinkle the dry ingredients (from the 3rd step) over the mixture and beat on the mixer's slowest setting until just combined. At this point, it's okay to stop the mixer even if you still have one or two flour streaks left — you can finish mixing these in by hand, with a rubber spatula. Be careful not to overmix, or you'll end up with a dense, heavy cake and it'll be the worst!, Transfer the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Smooth the top of the batter with an offset spatula and place the reserved banana half on top. Sprinkle the banana and the rest of the cake top with the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoon of demerara sugar., Transfer to the preheated oven and bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a cake skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, with minimal crumbs. Once the loaf is done, transfer to a wire rack to cool completely in its cake pan.","[, (, ', b, a, n, a, n, a, s, ', ,,  , 6, ., 0, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, a, k, i, n, g,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, a, k, i, n, g,  , s, o, d, a, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, o, w, n,  , s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 7, ., 0, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, s, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', l, a, r, g, e, ', ), ,,  , (, ', v, e, g, e, t, a, b, l, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 5, ., 3, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 2, ., 6, 5, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', v, a, n, i, l, l, a,  , e, x, t, r, a, c, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', r, u, m, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ]"

Once melted, stir in the sliced onions and salt. Cook over low heat, stirring often, until the onions deeply caramelize, about 1 to 2 hours. Be sure to consistently check them and stir! While the onions are caramelizing, work on the dough., In a bowl, stir together the water, yeast and honey. Let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes until foamy., In the bowl of your stand mixer, add the flour, garlic powder, 1 tablespoon of salt, 1/2 cup of olive oil and the yeast mixture. Stir, using the dough hook, until the mixture comes together. Knead it on medium-low speed for 5 to 6 minutes. If it's super sticky, sprinkle in a bit of extra flour. You want it to be silky!, Put the dough in an oiled bowl and cover it. Place it in a warm spot and let it rise for 1 hour, or until it's doubled in size., Once the dough has doubled, remove it from the bowl and divide it into 4 equal pieces. Roll and press the dough out until it’s about 6 to 8 inches in length and 4 or so inches in width. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Sprinkle the parchment paper liberally with flour so the dough doesn’t stick too much. Place the dough pieces on the baking sheets. Press the dough to make finger marks so it looks like traditional focaccia. Place the sheets in a warm spot and to rise again for 20 to 30 minutes., After 30 minutes, heat your grill over medium heat – around 450 degrees F.

Chop your favorite fresh herbs., Flour a pizza peel or cutting board very well (or something where you can easily slide the dough from the peel to the grill). Transfer the dough pieces one at a time to the floured peel, moving quickly so they don’t stick. Press to make more finger marks and brush with olive oil., Quickly transfer the dough by sliding it from the floured peel to the hot grill. Once it hits the grill, you can’t really move it without tearing the dough. Grill for 1 to 2 minutes, until the dough begins to bubble up and char. The dough can be flipped once it easily lifts from the grill. Flip the dough and grill for 1 to 2 minutes more, or again, until golden and puffed and brown. Remove the dough and place it on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining focaccia., Brush the hot focaccia with the garlic butter. Sprinkle with the herbs. Sprinkle with the flaked sea salt.

Add the butter to the hot milk and stir until completely melted, then allow to cool slightly., In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, brown sugar and salt and mix well. Add the apple cider or water, beaten egg, and the warm milk/butter mixture. Stir until the dough forms into a ball and then knead for five minutes, until smooth. This can be done in a stand mixer using a dough hook., Transfer the dough to a clean, oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. All to rise until doubled, about 1 hour., Apple Filling, While the dough is rising, prepare the apple filling by combining the diced apples, brown sugar, butter, lemon juice, vanilla, cinnamon and cornstarch in a large skillet and cooking over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the apples soften and release their juices. The juices will thicken slightly from the cornstarch, but it will still be very syrupy., Remove from heat and allow to cool while the dough rises., Assembly, Prepare 2 large bread pans with a parchment paper sling., Divide the dough into two equal-sized portions. On a very clean, lightly floured surface, roll out one portion of dough into a rectangle. Evenly spread have of the apple filling mixture, including juices, over the dough. Roll the dough starting from the long edge, cinnamon-roll style. Don't worry about the syrup leaking out too much as you roll., Using a bench scraper or sharp knife, cut the loaf diagonally in 1-inch slices, then change your angle and cut again in the other direction, creating an ""X"" pattern and slicing the rolled dough into small chunks., Scoop the chunks of dough and apple filling into the prepared bread pan, using the bench scraper to scoop up and add any spilled syrup into the pan. This part gets messy but it's the best way I've found to make sure there is even distribution of apples and syrup throughout the bread loaf. Repeat with the remaining bread dough and apple filling, then cover the loaves lightly with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes., Heat oven to 350 degrees. Bake loaves for 35-45 minutes, until brown on top and cooked through. When done, immediately remove the loafs of bread from the pans and place on wire racks., Prepare the glaze by whisking together the powdered sugar, butter, vanilla and apple cider or milk in a bowl.

9d46fcd5,https://amybakesbread.com/caramelized-onion-sourdough-bread/,Caramelized Onion Sourdough Bread,"40 grams ripe sourdough starter, 40 grams bread flour, 40 grams water, 100 grams ripe/bubbly/peaked levain, 450 grams bread flour (12.5% protein content), 50 grams whole wheat flour, 375 grams water (25 grams reserved for after fermentolyse), 10 grams salt, 100 grams caramelized onion jam (see recipe notes), 100 grams shredded Asiago cheese (see recipe notes)","Levain (1:1:1, 3-4 hours before, 78 degrees F), Mix Levain: Mix together ripe/active sourdough starter with bread flour and water. Cover loosely and let sit 3-4 hours at 78°F until doubled, bubbly & peaked., Caramelized Onion Asiago Sourdough, Note: Maintain the dough temperature at 78-80°F during the bulk fermentation for best results., Fermentolyse: Once the levain is ready (bubbly, doubled in size, milky sweet smell), mix together 100 grams levain, 350 grams water (warm the water if the ingredients are too cold and cool water if the ingredients are too warm), 450 grams bread flour and 50 grams whole wheat flour. Let rest for 30 minutes., Mixing: After 30 minutes, add the reserved 10 grams salt and 25 grams of water. Combine using your hands by squeezing the dough between your fingers, pinching chunks of dough and reincorporating together. The dough will break apart and then reform in the bowl through this process. Pick up one side of the dough and fold it over on itself. The dough will be sticky. Wet your hands as needed and continue to work with the dough until all the salt and water has been incorporated. Transfer the dough to a plastic container or a glass bowl and cover., Stretch and Folds: Perform a series of “stretch and folds” throughout the next 2 hours. The goal is to strengthen the dough. To “stretch and fold,” wet your hand (so it doesn’t stick to the dough). Reach around the dough down to the bottom of the bowl, pull the dough up and over and place it on top of the dough. Turn the bowl a quarter turn and repeat the stretch and fold. Turn another quarter turn and repeat. Perform one more quarter turn, stretching and folding the dough. Cover and set aside. Take note of how the dough feels through this process. It will go from feeling a little shaggy to smooth and elastic. Cover the bowl and wait about 30 minutes in between stretch and folds, Stretch and fold #1: 30 minutes into bulk fermentationStretch and fold #2: 30 minutes later, During this stretch and fold, spread the onion jam and asiago on top of the dough. Perform stretch and fold #2, adding the inclusions in as you fold.Stretch and fold #3: 30 minutes later Stretch and fold #4: Optional, if you want to disperse the inclusions more or you think your dough needs a little more strength., Rest: Cover the dough and let rise for 1.5-2 more hours. You’ll know the dough is ready to shape when the dough is puffed up, jiggles when you shake the bowl, has scattered bubbles visible on the sides and top., Pre-shape: Tip the bowl upside down, allowing the dough to fall onto a clean counter surface. Be gentle to avoid degassing the dough as much as possible. Wet your hands and the bench knife if needed and push the bench knife under the dough on one side and your free hand on the other side to tuck the dough under itself. The goal is to introduce some tension into the dough. Repeat this process, going around in a circle until you have a ball of dough., Bench Rest: Let the dough rest uncovered for about 30 minutes at room temperature. The dough will flatten (like a pancake) during this period of time. This allows the gluten in the dough to relax and prepares the dough to be shaped., Shaping: Prepare a bowl or banneton. Place a kitchen towel or hair net in the bowl and liberally flour as needed. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough. Using a bench knife, lift the dough up off the counter and place it on top of the countertop – floured side down. This ensures that the flour is staying mainly on the outside of the dough. Going around in a circle, pull the dough sideways towards you and then fold up to the top of the round. Move 90 degrees and repeat the same process pulling the dough sideways and then folding up to the top. As you continue this process around the dough, increase the tension as you pull. Gather the bread into a circle and place into a lined bowl. Remove any caramelized onions that have popped out on the surface of the dough to prevent burning in the oven., Cold Fermentation: Cover the dough with the tea towel/shower cap/plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or up to 12-20 hours. If you want to bake the same day, you can let the dough rise for about 3-4 hours until puffed up and risen. Then bake according to recipe directions., Preheat: Put a Dutch oven (top and all) into the oven and preheat to 500°F for 30 minutes. You are working with very high temperatures, so make sure you have some good hot pads. Once preheated for 30 minutes, pull the loaf out of the refrigerator. Remove the covering. Place a piece of parchment paper on top of the dough. Flip the dough over so it is now sitting on the parchment paper. Take off the bowl/banneton and the kitchen towel., Scoring: Use a very sharp knife or bread lame to score the dough. Take the bread lame and score on one side of the dough, at a shallow angle, about 1 inch deep. Remove any inclusions that pop out. Score straight from the refrigerator for best results., Baking: Carefully remove the Dutch oven from the 500°F oven. Take the lid off and place your bread into the Dutch oven (including parchment paper - this helps with the transfer). Put the lid on and put back in the oven. Lower the temperature to 450°F and bake for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, take the lid off the Dutch oven and continue baking for 20 minutes until the bread is a crackly deep brown. Remove the Dutch oven and let bread cool.

If there is any flour in your frying pan that might have burnt in the heat, make sure you wipe out the pan in between each naan., To make the naan a garlic naan, Brush the naan with a little garlic oil, add some chopped up fresh coriander and a little salt.","[, (, ', y, o, g, h, u, r, t, ', ,,  , 2, 6, 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 2, 5, 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', x, a, n, t, h, a, n,  , g, u, m, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, a, k, i, n, g,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ]"
ee9da767,https://www.melskitchencafe.com/cinnamon-sugar-twisted-croissant-bread/,Cinnamon Sugar Twisted Croissant Bread,"1 cup salted butter, cool room temperature, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, 2 cups warm water, 105-110 degrees F, 1 tablespoon instant or active dry yeast, 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 4 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting, Cinnamon sugar for sprinkling (see note)","For the butter packet: grab a piece of parchment paper about 16 1/4-inches by 12-inches (doesn't have to be exact, but should be close to those dimensions). Fold the two short edges of the parchment in toward each other about 4 1/2 inches. They will overlap a bit. Crease the edges well., Keep those edges folded in and fold the top and bottom edges in about 1 3/4-inches. It should form a little parchment packet when folded with the center rectangle dimensions about 8 1/2-inches by 7-inches (see note below for a visual). Set aside., With an electric mixer (handheld or stand mixer), whip the butter with the granulated sugar and cinnamon until well-combined., Unfold the parchment. Scrape the butter into the center square. Fold up the packet using the pre-creased folds and flip over so the folded edges are on the bottom., Use a rolling pin (or press with your hands), lightly roll the softened butter into a thin sheet so it reaches all the edges of the parchment packet and has a relatively even thickness. Chill in the fridge until firm., For the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, add the water, yeast and sugar, and let sit until foamy, 2-3 minutes. Add the salt and flour and mix until a soft dough forms that clears the sides of the bowl. Add additional flour, a little at a time, if the dough is sticking to the dough hook or sides of the bowl. The dough should be soft but not overly sticky., Knead for 3-4 minutes until the dough is soft and smooth. Cover the bowl or transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl and cover. Let rise until doubled, about an hour., Lightly deflate the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured counter. Roll into a rectangle about 18-inches by 11- or 12-inches., Take the butter packet out of the refrigerator, and unfold the parchment (but leave the butter on the parchment paper). Place the butter packet face down on the center of the rolled out bread dough. Peel the parchment carefully off the butter leaving the butter sheet on the dough., Work quickly and don't over work the dough during the next couple steps of folding and rolling so the butter doesn't get too soft!, Fold one short side of dough about halfway to 2/3 over the butter. Fold the other short side of dough over the butter, overlapping the first folded side by about an inch., Fold the top and bottom edges over about 1/2- to 1-inch and press to seal., Fold the dough in half (from right to left or vice versa) once more.Starting in the center, roll the dough out into a long, thin rectangle, about 8-inches by 22-inches. If the dough springs back when rolling, let it rest for 5-10 minutes to let the gluten relax and roll again., Fold one short edge of the long rectangle into the center. Repeat with the other short edge so they meet in the middle. Fold the dough in half (from one of the short sides). Let the dough rest for 2-3 minutes., Prepare two half sheet pans by lining with parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (400 degrees F for a darker crust)., Roll into a 12-inch or 13-inch square. If the dough springs back when rolling, let it rest for 5-10 minutes to let the gluten relax and roll again. Cut the square into four strips., Take each strip, twist it 3-4 times and place on the prepared sheet pans (two strips per sheet pan, spaced several inches apart)., Cover and let rise until noticeably puffy (the dough can rise in the refrigerator overnight or for several hours – when taking out of the refrigerator, if it hasn't risen enough, let it come to room temp and continue rising until nearly doubled). You don't want to let these loaves rise in an overly warm spot or the butter will melt before it hits the oven and you won't get the flaky, buttery layers., Bake the loaves until nicely golden, 20-22 minutes., Immediately out of the oven, use a pastry brush to brush any leaked butter on the sheet pan over the top of the loaves. Sprinkle the tops of the loaves with cinnamon sugar., Serve warm or at room temperature. Bread can be sliced or torn into pieces.","[, (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, i, n, n, a, m, o, n, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 4, ., 7, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ]"

Set aside for 10 – 15 minutes, or until the mixture starts frothing., In a separate bowl, mix together the psyllium husk and 240 g (1 cup) water. After about 15 – 30 seconds, a gel will form., In a large bowl, mix together the buckwheat flour, potato starch, brown rice flour and salt, until evenly combined., Add the yeast mixture, psyllium gel and apple cider vinegar to the dry ingredients. Knead the dough until smooth and it starts coming away from the bowl, about 5 – 10 minutes. You can knead by hand or using a stand mixer with a dough hook., Transfer the bread to a lightly oiled surface and knead it gently, forming it into a smooth ball. Place the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, seam side down, cover with a damp tea towel and allow to rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size., Once risen, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead it gently while forming it into a tight ball (see post for step-by-step photos). Flip it seam side down onto a part of the work surface that isn’t covered in flour and rotate in place to seal the seams., Place the dough into a 7 inch round proofing basket that you’ve dusted with some brown rice flour with the seams facing upwards. Cover with a damp tea towel and proof in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size., While the loaf is proofing, pre-heat the oven to 480 ºF (250 ºC) with a cast iron skillet on the middle rack or a Dutch oven/combo cooker on the lower middle rack. If you’re using a skillet, place a baking tray on the bottom rack of the oven., Once the dough has doubled in size, turn it out of the bread basket onto a piece of baking paper and score the top with a pattern of choice (the easiest pattern is a cross, about ¼ – ½ inch deep), using a bread lame or sharp knife. Take the hot cast iron skillet or Dutch oven/combo cooker out of the oven and then transfer the bread along with the baking paper into it.For a skillet or combo cooker, this is easiest by sliding a pizza peel or baking sheet underneath the baking paper and then using it to slide the bread along with the baking paper gently into the hot skillet/combo cooker. For a Dutch oven, use the sides of the baking paper as handles to transfer the bread into it., If using a skillet: place the skillet in the oven, pour hot water into the bottom baking tray, add 3 – 4 ice cubes around the bread (between the baking/greaseproof paper and the skillet), and close the oven door., If using a Dutch oven/combo cooker: add 3 – 4 ice cubes around the bread (between the baking/greaseproof paper and the walls of the Dutch oven/combo cooker) and close it, then place it into the pre-heated oven., Bake at 480 ºF (250 ºC) with steam for 20 minutes – don’t open the Dutch oven or the oven doors during this initial period, as that would allow the steam to escape out of the oven., After the 20 minutes, remove the bottom tray with water from the oven (for cast iron skillet) or uncover the Dutch oven/combo cooker, reduce the oven temperature to 450 ºF (230 ºC), and bake for a further 40 - 50 minutes in a steam-free environment. The final loaf should be of a deep, dark brown colour. If the loaf starts browning too quickly, cover with a piece of aluminium foil, shiny side up, and continue baking until done., Transfer the loaf onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely., Storage: The gluten free bread keeps well in a closed container or wrapped in a tea towel in a cool dry place for 3 – 4 days.","[, (, ', a, c, t, i, v, e,  , d, r, i, e, d,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 8, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, p, e, r, f, i, n, e, /, c, a, s, t, e, r,  , s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, r, m,  , w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 3, 9, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, s, y, l, l, i, u, m,  , h, u, s, k, ', ,,  , 2, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, c, k, w, h, e, a, t,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, 3, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, o, t, a, t, o,  , s, t, a, r, c, h, ', ,,  , 1, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, o, w, n,  , r, i, c, e,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 9, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', t, a, b, l, e,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', a, p, p, l, e,  , c, i, d, e, r,  , v, i, n, e, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ]"

It may take longer to rise properly in colder, drier weather and less time in warmer, more humid weather., When the dough has nearly reached the end of its rise, preheat the oven to 375°F., Remove the plastic wrap, and using a sharp knife or lame slash the top of the loaf about 1/4-inch deep. If using the optional seeds, brush the top of the risen bread gently with melted butter, and sprinkle with the seeds., Place the pan in the center of the preheated oven. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the internal temperature of the bread reaches about 195°F on an instant-read thermometer.

It should feel warm, but not hot, to the touch. Let it sit to activate for about 10 to 15 minutes. You should notice it start to to bubble, and then it will get nice and foamy on top., In a bowl or liquid measuring cup, mix together the psyllium husk, olive oil, and water. Whisk together, breaking up the psyllium, and let it set for a few minutes until it’s thickened and gel-like., In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, mix together all of your flours, starches, and salt. Whisk to combine., Add the psyllium gel and the activated yeast mixture to your dry ingredients. If using a stand mixer, fit it with the dough hook and let it mix up the dough until combined and smooth, scraping down the sides a few times during the process, and flipping the dough around to make sure it’s fully mixed on the bottom too. You can also do this by hand. If doing it by hand, I like using a dough whisk to get it mostly combined. Then, turn it out onto the countertop and use your hands to knead the rest of the flour in., Use your hands to knead the dough and shape it into your desired shape. Then, place it in the banneton (seam side up) or loaf pan (seam side down) for the final proof., Cover with a tea towel and let the loaf rise for one hour in a warm place. It should just about double in size, and it will feel light and puffy to the touch when it’s ready. Preheat the oven to 425℉ while it rises with a Dutch oven inside, if using., Once it’s risen, score the bread (carefully flipping it out of the banneton onto parchment or a silicone sling if baking in a Dutch oven). If you’re baking in a loaf pan, you may want to brush the top with oil to get a nice golden crust and help soften it slightly., Place into your baking vessel if using a Dutch oven. If using a loaf pan, just place right into the oven. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, removing the lid for the last 15 minutes if baking in a Dutch oven. It should be golden brown and crusty., Remove from the baking pan and set on a cooling rack to cool completely. This is definitely the hardest part, but you really need to let the loaf cool completely so the inside can set. I try to let it cool overnight, but you’ll want to let it cool for at least four to five hours. It should be fully cool to the touch before cutting into your loaf., Slice and eat.

Move the top oven rack to the middle rack. Preheat your oven to 350°F. I used both a 9-inch x 4-inch Small Pullman loaf pan., Add the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and instant yeast to a large bowl and stir to combine the ingredients., Add the olive oil, honey, and apple cider vinegar, and warm water to the flour mixture and mix on low for 1 minute. If you are using a stand-up mixer use the paddle attachment, not the dough hook., Add the egg whites and the salt to the dough and mix on medium for 1 minute. The dough will look like a thick cake batter., Pour the dough into a greased 9-inch x 5-inch bread pan or the 9-inch x 4-inch small Pullman loaf pan. I HIGHLY recommend using a 9-inch x 4-inch Small Pullman loaf pan. Spray plastic wrap with gluten-free cooking spray and cover the top of the pan. Cover the pan with a kitchen towel and allow the bread to rise in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes., Place in the oven to bake for 30 minutes at 350°F. Bake the bread on the middle rack horizontally. The bread will be golden brown and have the internal temperature between 205-210ºF., Allow the loaf to cool for 10 minutes in the pan. Remove the loaf from the baking pan and place it on a cooling rack. If the bread completely cools in the pan, the steam can get trapped and the loaf can get soggy, especially on the bottom. Allow the bread to cool completely before slicing., Store the leftover bread in an airtight container, once it’s completely cooled. It may be kept on the counter at room temperature. It is also best not to pre-slice the bread before you store it, so just store the left-over portion of the loaf., The bread can be frozen once it is completely cooled. Wrap the loaf tightly in plastic wrap, then wrap it in foil or freezer paper. Place the wrapped loaf in a freezer bag. The bread can be frozen up to 3 months. Thaw the bread in the refrigerator overnight.","[, (, ', a, l, l, -, p, u, r, p, o, s, e,  , g, l, u, t, e, n, -, f, r, e, e,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', x, a, n, t, h, a, n,  , g, u, m, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, l, u, t, e, n, -, f, r, e, e,  , b, a, k, i, n, g,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', r, a, p, i, d,  , r, i, s, e, /, i, n, s, t, a, n, t,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', p, a, c, k, e, t, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, x, t, r, a,  , v, i, r, g, i, n,  , o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, o, n, e, y, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', a, p, p, l, e,  , c, i, d, e, r,  , v, i, n, e, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, r, m,  , w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g,  , w, h, i, t, e, s, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ]"

Stir the sugar into the warm water and until dissolved, then add the yeast and stir again. Leave in a warm spot for 5-10 minutes for the yeast to activate. It should form a lovely froth on top when it's ready., Add the gluten free bread flour, xanthan gum and salt to a large mixing bowl and stir to mix together., In a separate mug or bowl, add the eggs, oil and vinegar and lightly whisk to combine., Once the yeast/water mixture is active (frothy), add it to the flour along with the egg/oil mixture.

Add the honey, olive oil, and water. Place on mixer and mix briefly to incorporate. Turn the mixer up to medium high and knead for 5 minutes. Remove the dough hook and scrape the dough into a cohesive mass using a plastic dough scraper or a rubber spatula (or scrape into another bowl). Cover and place the bowl in a warm, draft-free area and allow it to rise (proof) for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in volume., Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight, but up to 10 days., On baking day, remove the dough from refrigerator and dump it out onto well-floured surface. Knead until fairly smooth, adding more flour as necessary. If not using the psyllium husks, it will be a somewhat sticky dough so keep a small bowl of flour on hand to sprinkle the dough and/or surface with extra flour., To shape into a boule, simply form into a round ball, pulling the dough up and under the ball and pinching on the bottom. Place on parchment paper. To shape into a baguette, smooth the dough and roll into a rope shape, tapering it at the ends, adding more flour as necessary. Roll out as thick or thin as you'd like and as long as you're able to fit in your oven (make sure it will fit on your pizza steel or stone). Place it on a sheet of parchment paper., Place the loaf or loaves, covered loosely with plastic wrap, in a warm, draft-free area to rise until visibly puffed and slightly larger, but not doubled in size, about 1/2 to 1 hour. This time will vary depending on the warmth of your proofing area., BAKING STEEL OR STONE METHOD: Set up your oven for baking. Place a baking steel or stone (or overturned baking sheet) onto the middle rack with a shallow pan on a rack underneath. Preheat the oven to 450° F., DUTCH OVEN METHOD: Place a Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid into the oven and preheat it to 500° F. You won't need the shallow pan with steam as enough steam will be created in the Dutch oven once the bread goes in. NOTE: This will only work with boules or loaves that can fit into the Dutch oven. If you're making a longer batard or baguette, you'll need to use the first method., When the dough has finished rising and is visibly puffed, run a serrated knife under hot tap water and cut slits in the dough swiftly but uniformly, about ½-¾ inch deep., BAKING STEEL OR STONE METHOD: Fill a measuring cup with one cup of very hot water (from the tap is fine). Using a pizza peel (paddle), slide the loaf (or loaves) onto the baking steel (or stone), parchment and all. Immediately pour the cup of very hot tap water into the shallow pan. Quickly shut the oven door., DUTCH OVEN METHOD: Remove the lid carefully and carefully lower the dough, parchment and all, into the Dutch oven. Replace the lid and shut the oven door. Immediately reduce the temperature down to 450° F., BAKING STEEL OR STONE METHOD: Bake for about 30 minutes for baguettes, or about 40 minutes for boules, OR longer for larger boules (some larger boules can take up to an HOUR or more). If the loaves are getting too browned, you can cover them loosely with foil. The loaves will look crusty and done on the outside, but will feel light when picked up. If they feel heavy, they're not done yet. Allow them to bake for another 5-10 minutes and then check again, picking up the loaf with two gloved hands. If they're still feeling heavy, allow them to bake for another 5 minutes and check again., DUTCH OVEN METHOD: Bake the bread for 40 minutes with the lid on. Remove the cover and continue to bake for another 20 minutes. Check for doneness by picking up the loaf (with gloved hands). If the loaf feels relatively light for its size, it's done. If it feels at all heavy, it's not done and give it another 5-10 minutes before checking again., Remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack. Allow to cool COMPLETELY before cutting (or it will be gummy on the inside).","[, (, ', k, i, m, ', s,  , g, l, u, t, e, n,  , f, r, e, e,  , b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r,  , b, l, e, n, d, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', x, a, n, t, h, a, n,  , g, u, m, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, s, y, l, l, i, u, m,  , h, u, s, k, s, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, s, y, l, l, i, u, m,  , h, u, s, k,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', i, n, s, t, a, n, t, /, r, a, p, i, d,  , r, i, s, e, /, f, a, s, t, -, a, c, t, i, n, g,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', k, o, s, h, e, r,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 7, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, o, n, e, y, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ]"

If your oven does not have a bread proofing setting, heat the oven to 100 degrees then turn it off (see notes if your oven doesn’t display what temperature it’s at while preheating)., Add the gluten free flour blend, baking powder, sugar, instant yeast, and salt to the bowl of an electric stand mixer, or a large glass bowl if using a hand-held mixer, then mix on low to combine. Note: if you’re using a hand-held mixer, use a whisk to combine the dry ingredients so they don’t fly everywhere., Microwave water for 35-40 seconds then stir and take a temperature with an instant read thermometer — we’re looking for 110-115 degrees., Pour the water and vinegar into the dry ingredients in the mixing bowl then beat on medium speed until well combined. Let the dough rest for 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil then beat on low speed until just combined. Turn speed up to medium then beat for 1 minute. The dough will be very sticky and similar to cake batter consistency — that’s ok!, Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl and give the dough a big stir to ensure the ingredients are well combined. Cover the bowl with a tea towel then place inside the preheated oven and let rise for 30 minutes., After 30 minutes, remove the bowl from the oven, place the oven rack into the center position, then raise the temperature of the oven to 375 degrees., Spray a 9x5” glass loaf pan very well with nonstick spray then add 1 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil inside and tilt the pan to evenly coat the bottom. Scrape the dough inside then spread into an even layer. Use the tip of your spatula to dollop the top of the dough to make small peaks which will mimic the dimples usually found on top of focaccia bread after baking (see photos for example). Drizzle remaining Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil on top then sprinkle on salt, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and crushed rosemary, all to taste., Once the oven has reached 375 degrees, bake bread for 33-35 minutes or until the top of the bread is deeply browned. Avoid under-baking or the bread can be dense and gummy. Let bread rest in the baking pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool slightly. Slice then serve while warm., Bread is best baked and eaten on the same day. If there are leftovers, wrap in foil then store on the counter for 1 day. Reheat wrapped in foil in a 350 degree oven until hot, 15-20 minutes., To freeze: Bake focaccia bread then let cool completely. Wrap tightly in foil then place inside a Ziplock freezer bag and freeze. Thaw then bake still wrapped in foil in a 350 degree oven until hot, 15-20 minutes.","[, (, ', g, l, u, t, e, n,  , f, r, e, e,  , b, a, k, i, n, g,  , f, l, o, u, r,  , b, l, e, n, d, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  ,  , (, ', b, a, k, i, n, g,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  ,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  ,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  ,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  ,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 7, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  ,  , (, ', a, p, p, l, e,  , c, i, d, e, r,  , v, i, n, e, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  ,  , (, ', e, x, t, r, a,  , v, i, r, g, i, n,  , o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  ,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  ,  , (, ', g, a, r, l, i, c,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  ,  , (, ', i, t, a, l, i, a, n,  , s, e, a, s, o, n, i, n, g, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  ,  , (, ', r, o, s, e, m, a, r, y, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ]"

It should be on the rise and have a domed top when you measure it into the bowl. To fit this around a normal work schedule, I’d suggest feeding your starter at 5.30pm, and then waiting until bedtime (or the peak of your starter) to make the pre-ferment., Once the starter is ready to go, mix it with the water and then add the flour. Stir until combined and cover with cling film or a wrap. I hate recommending cling film but it does do a good job here., Leave this in a reasonably warm, draft free place overnight. I use my oven with just the light, not the heat turned on., To make the loaf:, In a medium sized mixing bowl, combine the psyllium husk, water, honey and salt. Whisk to combine, and then leave for 5-10 minutes to thicken into a gel., While you’re waiting, combine the flours in a large glass or plastic mixing bowl., Once the psyllium gel has thickened, mix the pre-ferment into it and whisk to combine. Add this wet mixture to the flours and use a spoon to combine the mixture as much as possible. Once it’s almost mixed, use your hands to squelch the dough around, picking up dry bits of flour as you go. If you’ve weighed everything diligently there shouldn’t be a need for extra water, but you can add 1-2 tablespoons if it’s truly truly necessary. You should be able to pick up the dough and shape it., Once the dough is completely mixed through and formed into a rough ball, tip it onto a very lightly (white rice) floured bench. Use your hands (and the Youtube links above) to close any seams as much as possible. Make sure the side with no seams is the top of your loaf., When the dough is shaped, lightly flour your banneton or bowl with white rice flour. Place the nice side of the dough (aka the side with no seams that you’ve chosen as the top of the loaf) down into the banneton. The base of the loaf (with all the seams) should be facing upwards now., Cover the loaf with a lightly oiled showercap or the cling you used for the pre-ferment. Place the loaf in a warm, draft free place (again, I use my oven with just the light on) for 2-3 hours, or until it’s a little jiggly and a finger poke springs back halfway., To bake the loaf:, Half an hour or so before baking the loaf, place your dutch oven in the oven get the heat up to 250C or 500F. Making sure the dutch oven is very hot is integral to getting oven spring., When the oven and loaf are both ready, take a long piece of baking paper and lay it on the bench. It needs to be long enough that you can lower the loaf into the dutch oven without burning your arms. In my experience, dropping the loaf into the dutch oven results in a flat and gummy loaf., Invert the loaf onto the centre of the baking paper, leaving the edges for lowering handles. Use a lame (sharp scoring blade) or a sharp knife to make a reasonably deep incision in the loaf. Google ‘bread scoring’ for some pattern ideas, or just keep it simple., Get all your oven gear ready to work quickly for this next step. Carefully and quickly remove the super hot dutch oven from the oven. Shut the oven door while you work. Take the lid off and quickly lower in the bread. If you’re using an ice cube for extra oven spring, add it now. Pop the lid back on and quickly return the dutch oven to the oven. Turn the oven down to 200-220c., Bake the loaf with the lid on for 40-50 minutes. If you prefer a less caramelised (aka dark) crust, leave the lid on a little longer. Once the time is up, remove the lid and continue to bake your loaf for another 40 or so minutes, or until the crust sounds hollow when you knock on it and is deeply caramelised brown in colour., Once cooked, remove the loaf from the oven and baking paper and place it on a cooling rack. Allow to cool completely (3-4 hours AT LEAST) before slicing into it, as you can compress all the air in the loaf and end up with extremely gummy bread., You can store the loaf in a bag or freeze it in slices.","[, ', (, s, o, u, r, d, o, u, g, h,  , s, t, a, r, t, e, r, ,,  , 1, 5, 0, ,,  , g, ), ', ,,  , ', (, w, h, i, t, e,  , r, i, c, e,  , f, l, o, u, r, ,,  , 6, 0, ,,  , g, ), ', ,,  , ', (, w, a, t, e, r, ,,  , 1, 5, 0, ,,  , g, ), ', ,,  , ', (, p, s, y, l, l, i, u, m,  , h, u, s, k, ,,  , 2, 0, ,,  , g, ), ', ,,  , ', (, w, a, t, e, r, ,,  , 2, 5, 0, ,,  , g, ), ', ,,  , ', (, w, a, t, e, r, ,,  , 2, 7, 5, ,,  , g, ), ', ,,  , ', (, h, o, n, e, y, ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ), ', ,,  , ', (, s, u, g, a, r, ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ), ', ,,  , ', (, s, e, a,  , s, a, l, t, ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, q, u, i, n, o, a,  , f, l, o, u, r, ,,  , 5, 5, ,,  , g, ), ', ,,  , ', (, s, o, r, g, h, u, m,  , f, l, o, u, r, ,,  , 1, 0, 0, ,,  , g, ), ', ,,  , ', (, t, a, p, i, o, c, a,  , f, l, o, u, r, ,,  , 7, 5, ,,  , g, ), ', ,,  , ', (, w, h, i, t, e,  , r, i, c, e,  , f, l, o, u, r, ,,  , 6, 0, ,,  , g, ), ', ]"

Mix on low speed to let the dough come together, about 1 minute., Increase speed to medium and beat for 5 minutes, scraping down paddle and bowl halfway through. The batter will be thinner, slightly thicker than cake batter., Grease a 9X5 or 9X4 baking pan. Pour into the pan and smooth top evenly with a spatula. Spray a large piece of plastic wrap with nonstick cooking spray. Lay the plastic, greased side down, over the pan., Set in a warm, draft-free place to rise until the bread reaches two-thirds to the top of the pan (do not let it go over this point because it rises more in the oven). This should take about 30-45 minutes. Meanwhile preheat oven to 350°F., Remove plastic and bake bread on middle rack for 40-45 minutes, tenting a piece of foil loosely over the bread halfway through. The internal temperature of the bread should read 190-200°F., Allow the loaf to cool for 5 minutes in the pan and then remove to a cooling rack.

You will notice the texture of the dough change. This step is very important to ensure that the flour hydrates properly., Leave the dough in the mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise for 1-2 hours, until double in size. Rising time will depend on the temperature of the room -- if it's cold, it will take longer to rise. If it's warm, the rising time will be shorter. It is important that you do not underproof or overproof the dough., Prepare the Loaf, Line a loaf pan with parchment paper and sprinkle a little flour evenly on the bottom of the pan., Oil a spatula or cover it with cooking spray. Use the spatula to fold the dough (this is the equivalent of kneading it after it's second rise). If the dough begins to stick to the spatula, re-oil it., Put your dough into the prepared loaf pan. The dough won't be thin enough to pour, so guide it into the pan with the spatula., Oil with the spatula again and use it to smooth the top of the bread. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rise for an additional 30-45 minutes., Preheat the oven to 450 degreed Farenheit with on rack in the middle and one on the bottom. Place a small roasting pan (or somthing similar) to the bottom rack. When you put the bread in the oven, you'll pour hot water into the pan to create steam. You want the oven to be very hot and at temperature, so I like to have it running a good 30 minutes before I plan to put the bread in the oven., Bake the Loaf, Remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the top of the dough with flour (not necessary, but makes it look more artisinal!) Have 1 cup of hot taper water ready to use when you place the dough in the oven., Place the dough on the middle rack and quickly pour the hot water into the pan on the bottom rack. Close the oven door quickly. This technique creates steam which helps the bread rise and also get a nice crust., Bake the loaf for approximately 40 minutes, it will be a deep dark brown., Once the loaf has cooled slightly, remove it from the pan and place on a cooling rack. Let the loaf cool COMPLETELY befor cutting into it. If you cut it too early, the texture will not be as good., Store the Loaf, After you have cut into the bread, store it in a paper or plastic bag. If using a plastic bag, do not seal it completly. You can also loosely wrap it in plastic wrap. It is best if eaten within 2 days, but I've kept it longer and it holds it's texture pretty well.","[, (, ', g, l, u, t, e, n, -, f, r, e, e,  , b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r,  , m, i, x, ', ,,  , 5, 2, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ]"

Mix for about 3-4 minutes until you have a smooth dough. It will be a very soft, sticky dough., Grease the inside (base and sides) of a non-stick 2lb loaf tin with a little olive oil. Then use a spatula or dough scraper to transfer the bread dough into the tin. Wet your fingers and use them to gently level and smooth out the top of the dough., Rub one side of large piece of cling film (larger than your loaf tin) with a little olive oil and lay, oil-side down, over the bread tin and dough. Ensure it is slightly baggy, to allow the dough space to rise, rather than maing it taut. Then leave to prove for about 1 hour, or until the dough has reached the top of the tin. On a cold day it may take slightly longer, on a warm day slightly less., Once proved, preheat your oven to 200C (fan). Lightly brush the top of the loaf with oil and use a sharp knife with a wet blade (just run under water - it helps ensure the dough does not stick to the nife) to make 5 slashes (about 1 cm deep) across the top of the loaf., Place on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 35 minutes. After this time the loaf should be golden and the bottom will sound hollow when tapped., Remove from the tin (if should come out really easily) and set on a wire rack to cool...or enjoy it warm if you are finding it too irresistible! Once fully cooled, store in an airtight container (or wrapped in cling film) and it will keep for a couple of days.

Use the dough hook to mix until all ingredients are combined, the dough comes together, and there isn't any loose flour left., Bulk Fermentation: Gently form the dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled and floured medium glass bowl. Loosely cover and leave in a draft-free place for 6-10 hours. 6 hours if your house is on the warm side and up to 10 hours if your house is cooler. I generally let mine rise for about 8 hours. At this point, you don't want your dough to double in size., 2nd Proof/Retard (around 8pm): After the first rise, transfer the bowl to the refrigerator to finish proofing in the refrigerator for 12 hours. You can keep the dough in the same bowl or you can gently reshape it and place it in a floured Banneton Basket., Day 2 (Around 8 am), Place your Dutch Oven on the center rack and preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Let the Dutch Oven preheat at 500 degrees for at least 30 minutes., When the Dutch Oven has preheated, remove from the dough from the refrigerator. Turn the dough out onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper., With generously floured hands, gently re-shape to a tighter ball and use the flour to smooth the dough. The dough should be completely coated with a layer of flour. (Skip this if you proofed in a Banneton Basket), Use a sharp knife or bread lame to slash the bread, you want the slash to be at least 1-inch deep. You can make it decorative or keep it simple to start and just do an X in the middle., Remove the Dutch Oven from the preheated oven. Use the corners of the parchment paper to lift the dough and carefully place it in the Dutch Oven so you don't burn yourself. Place 2 large ice cubes in the Dutch Oven between the parchment paper and sides of the DO and quickly cover with the lid., Place the Dutch Oven back on the center rack and lower the temperature to 450 degrees. Bake at 450 for 40 minutes., After 40 minutes lower the oven temperature to 425 degrees and then remove the lid from the Dutch Oven. Bake for an additional 40 minutes, uncovered, at 425 degrees., When the bread is done, it should have an internal temperature of at least 210 degrees and the bottom of the bread should sound hollow when you knock on it.

Or you can bake in a large dutch oven with a lid., In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt., In another bowl, combine eggs and buttermilk.. Make sure the eggs are combined well with the other ingredients., Pour all of the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients at one time. With a large spoon, stir by hand a few times. The dough will come together pretty quickly. The dough should not be sticky and should form a ball easily in your hands. If it seems sticky, add a small amount of flour or flour your hands to see if it holds its shape. Once it does, place it on the parchment paper on the baking sheet or in a dutch oven., Using a sharp knife, cut a “plus sign across the top of the dough about ½ inch deep. Cover with the large oven safe bowl or lid of dutch oven and place in the hot oven. Bake covered for 45 minutes. Remove the bowl/lid and continue baking for another 5 minutes uncovered., The bread is done when it reaches 200 degrees. If you don’t have a thermometer, make sure to remove it by 50 minutes. Let it cool for at least an hour before cutting it. It will be very sticky inside if you cut it while it is still warm. Let it cool and it will cut nicely. After cutting it, you can reheat it by popping it in the microwave for about 15 seconds.","[, (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, a, k, i, n, g,  , s, o, d, a, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, a, k, i, n, g,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, s, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ]"

In the bowl of a stand mixer, place butter, eggs, cottage cheese, and water. Use a fork to whisk together until blended., Add dry ingredients to the egg mixture. Place..., Add dry ingredients to the egg mixture. Place bowl in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Turn mixer on low and mix until the dry and wet ingredients are blended. Turn speed up to medium high and mix for 4 minutes. Stop mixer and use an oiled rubber spatula to scrape down the sides of the dough once or twice., Turn out dough into a large oiled bowl, brush top with oil, and cover with plastic wrap. Place covered bowl in a warm, draft-free place to rise for 1 hour. I use the inside of my oven as a rising space. I make it a bit warm before I put the bowl in by preheating the oven at 350 degrees F (176 degrees C) for 20 seconds and then turn off., While the dough is rising, grease with oil and flour with tapioca flour a 8.5 x 4.5 x 2.75 in (21.59 x 11.43 x 6.99 cm) loaf pan (sometimes called a 1 pound Loaf Pan)., After the dough has risen for 1 hour, it should be noticeably puffed up.

You want to be careful not to squish down the rising that it has done. Brush top with oil. Lightly cover with plastic wrap while preheating the oven., Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (176 degrees C) for half an hour. Since it takes my old oven a fairly long time to get to the correct temperature, I use this time for additional rising. I preheat the oven for a good half an hour—which allows the bread to rise some more in the pan. Also, I set the pan on top of the stove to take advantage of the heat from the preheating oven. Don’t let the dough rise more than about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) above pan., After half an hour, uncover the dough and bake for about 45 minutes or until the inside of the bread reaches at least 205 degrees F (96 degrees C) when tested with an instant read thermometer. I find that the bread turns a medium dark brown on the top with little darker spots on it where the cheese curds are. If it starts burning on the top, cover with aluminum foil., Remove from oven and place pan on a cooling rack for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, carefully run a knife along the inside edge of the loaf and carefully turn it out onto the cooling rack. I use an old trick I learned years ago to let it cool on one long side for about 20 minutes and then switch it so it’s laying on the other long side for another 20 minutes. Then set it upright. This helps the bread not settle down and get squished-looking., Cool bread completely before slicing. It is doing..., Cool bread completely before slicing. It is doing the last bit of baking while cooling and if you cut it too early, it will be very gummy inside.

Add flours. Mix with fork until dry, then finish incorporating flours with hands until no flour streaks remain., Let rest, covered with a damp cloth, for 45 minutes. This is the autolyse stage., When autolyse is complete, add salt and squeeze liberally into dough. Mix dough with your hands for 3 minutes, kneading and really working the salt into the dough. Then perform your first set of stretch and folds. Let rest for 30 minutes, and repeat set of stretch and folds. Do this 2 more times, for a total of 4 sets of stretch and folds., When that is finished, let dough rest, cover bowl with a damp cloth and let dough rise until just about doubled, but not quite. You will see some small bubbles around the edges of the top of the dough, and it will be a bit domed, and tiny bubbles all throughout the inside of the dough when you look at the sides of the bowl. This is when bulk fermentation is complete. With my house at 70 degrees F, this took about 4 hours from the last set of stretch and folds., Gently move dough onto a lightly floured surface. Let rest for 15 minutes, covered. Then shape your bread and use a bench scraper to put dough into banneton, seam side up. and put into a banneton.

Add the salt and mix to disperse.In a separate bowl or pitcher, add the yeast to the water (75-80F). Mix to disperse lumps., Using a large spoon or fork, stir the liquid into the flour. When all the water has been added it will be a rather sticky lump. With wet hands, knead the dough by pushing, pulling and stretching it. There are many examples of kneading dough on YouTube., After kneading for a few minutes, the dough will become less sticky and wet, beginning to look like a bread dough., Cover and let sit on the counter for 1- 2 hours. This is proofing time (the dough is rising). It will rise more quickly if the kitchen temperature is 70+F. if it is less than 70 F it will take longer which is the reason for the 1-2 hour range., Preheat oven to 375 F., Now the dough needs to be handled gently so as to not deflate it. Scrape dough out on to a lightly floured counter. This is the final shaping (examples of methods on You Tube). Round it up and shape it into an oblong loaf., Place in a bread pan that has been oiled with both butter and olive oil. Use this combination for best release. Cover the dough to keep it from drying out. Leave it on the counter and let it proof while the oven heats, about 30-45 minutes., Place dough in the preheated oven and bake for about 35-45 minutes.

If your starter is thick, you can increase your water., Presoak the flour by combining all 1000g of flour with all 720g of water. Mix for 3-5 minutes into a shaggy dough, then cover for one hour (this is called an autolyze)., After the presoak, add the salt to the dough and mix enough to combine it. Add the sourdough starter and mix thoroughly. After about 3 minutes of vigorous mixing, it should start to look like bread dough. After 3 minutes of mixing with a dough whisk, switch to your hands and mix for another minute or until you have a smooth bread dough., Tip: wet your hands to help the dough not stick. If you flour your hands, you risk incorporating too much flour into the dough., Mixing the sourdough into the pre-soaked flour is a little challenging part of this recipe. It can be done by hand or mixer. By hand you should use the “pincer method” of pinching and turning the dough. If you use a mixer, you may have to stop the mixer and use a wooden spoon to stir the pre-soaked dough and starter together. This will help the starter and presoak begin to combine and then you can continue mixing. Once you get the combination started with a wooden spoon, the mixer will be much more successful., When mixed into a smooth bread dough, place the dough in a large mixing bowl and cover for a bulk ferment of several hours depending on the temperature of the room. If the temp is more than 70F it will double in size in a few hours. If it is less than 70F, it will take longer so keep an eye on it., Once about doubled in size, stretch and fold by grabbing the dough and pulling it up and toward the center in four stretches at 90 degrees each, top, left, bottom, right. Cover and repeat the same stretch and fold in twenty minutes. (The dough needs twenty minutes to relax between stretch and folds). You can decide how many stretch and folds to do, anywhere from 2-5 is common. The dough will get stronger with each stretch and fold., Divide into two equal portions, shape and place in bannetons (or greased bowls), or greased bread pans. Cover with a plastic bag and place in the refrigerator for 12 hours., After the 12 hours, If the dough looks fully proofed (has nearly doubled in size) you can bake it right away. If it looks like it could use more proofing time, keep it in the plastic wrap and set it on the counter to proof a bit more before baking., Heat oven to 425F – 450F. If you are using a Dutch oven, place the Dutch oven in the oven when you start the preheat. A good half hour preheat is required for Dutch ovens., Dutch oven method - slash the dough with a razor blade and place it in the preheated Dutch oven. Cover and bake for about 25 minutes. For a darker crust, remove the cover from the Dutch oven after 15 minutes., Bread pan method - slash the dough and place in the oven. Reduce the heat to 350F and bake for about 40 minutes. For a darker crust, cover the pan with foil and remove the last 10-15 minutes. For a softer (and lighter) crust, cover the loaf the whole time., At the end of the bake time check the inside temperature of bread with a thermometer. It should read 195-205F when done., Remove from pan or Dutch oven immediately and let cool on a rack that will allow air to circulate under the bread., It is important to understand that it takes practice to get the feel of sourdough baking. If you are not getting the results you desire, you can increase the amount of starter or adjust the hydration. Every time you combine flour, water, salt, and starter, it is an experiment so have fun with it.","[, (, ', h, e, r, i, t, a, g, e,  , w, h, i, t, e,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, 0, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 7, 2, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', a, c, t, i, v, e,  , s, o, u, r, d, o, u, g, h,  , s, t, a, r, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, 5, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ]"

If the bottom is not brown enough for your liking, let it bake bottom-side-up for another 10 minutes at 375F., Cool Fully Before Slicing, Allow the loaf to fully cool before slicing (this is important as the loaf may disintegrate if it’s still hot when you slice).","[, (, ', g, l, u, t, e, n, -, f, r, e, e,  , a, l, l, -, p, u, r, p, o, s, e,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', x, a, n, t, h, a, n,  , g, u, m, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, l, u, t, e, n, -, f, r, e, e,  , b, a, k, i, n, g,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', i, n, s, t, a, n, t,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, n, f, l, o, w, e, r,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 0, ., 3, 3, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', a, p, p, l, e,  , c, i, d, e, r,  , v, i, n, e, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', u, n, s, w, e, e, t, e, n, e, d,  , a, l, m, o, n, d,  , m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, s, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ]"

Pour room temperature water over the top of the soaker. Leave out at room temperature for about 6-8 hours. If you forget to do this, you can pour hot water (hot to touch) over the soaker before you start preparing the ingredients for the bread., For the Dough:, Line the inside of a 8.5L x 4.5W x 2.75H inch loaf pan (23cm X 13cm) with criss crossing parchment with enough hangover on all sides to later help shape the dough and to be used as handles for removing the bread from the pan. If you have clips to clip the parchment to the sides, use them., UPDATE 5/20: Some makers have commented that they ""poured"" the dough into the baking pan. Please note that the dough should be of a sticky thickish batter-like consistency where it is scraped into the pan and holds together. The dough should not be pourable. In order to achieve this batter-like consistency, Psyllium Husk Powder is essential. I do not recommend substituting this ingredient. *If still concerned about a pourable batter, hold a little bit of the water out instead of adding it all at once, then add more as needed. Mix the Dough: In a large mixing bowl, add the starter, water and maple syrup (or honey). Whisk until the starter is incorporated. Set aside.In a medium mixing bowl whisk the brown rice flour, millet flour, oat flour, tapioca flour, psyllium husk powder and fine sea salt. Mix throughly so that when the psyllium husk powder hits the water, it wont clump. To the water/starter mixture add the flour mixture. Use a fork to mix the flour into the water until the dough starts to stiffen, about one minute. The dough will feel like a thick batter. Add the soaker and knead the dough with your hand, incorporating the soaker until the mixture is evenly distributed, about one minute. Use the fork to scrape any excess dough off your hands and fingers. The dough will be very sticky. Set the bowl aside for about 10 minutes to rest. It will stiffen a bit as it rests., Shape and Pan the Dough: There are two ways to approach shaping. a. if you're in a hurry or b. if you have a bit more time and patience. Either will work but I find I get a better shape out of b. (note that a. was used in the images seen above). A. Scrape the batter into the loaf pan. Use a moist rubber spatula (remoisten as needed) to gently shape the top nudging the edges of the loaf inward to produce a nice dome shape loaf bread is known for. This takes a little practice and finessing. Just do the best you can. Use the 'handles' of the parchment and pull opposite sides inwards towards the center of the dough, helping to round and shape the edges. Moisten your fingers or small spatula and smooth the top to rid any lumpy areas. B. A bench scraper for this method is needed. Moisten your work surface with a bit of water (I use a spray bottle and sprits it a few times). With moistened fingers, nudge the dough out of the bowl and onto the moist surface. The dough will be very sticky. Re-moisten your hands and pat the dough into a rough rectangle/log a little smaller than the size of the loaf pan using the bench scraper as needed to move the dough. Pat and smooth the edges as needed using wet hands (no flour here), rocking the dough back and fourth to help shape it, smoothing and rounding the top into a rectangular dome. This takes a little practice and finessing, just do the best you can. Using one swift move, scoop up the shaped dough with a bench scraper and transfer it to the loaf pan. Use the 'handles' of the parchment and pull opposite sides inwards towards the center of the dough, helping to round and shape the edges. Do this several times. Moisten your fingers or small spatula and smooth the top to rid any lumpy areas. Use a moist rubber spatula to gently shape the top nudging the edges of the loaf inward to produce a nice dome shape loaves of bread are known for.Now is a good time to refresh (feed) your starter and store it for next time., Bulk Ferment: Remove the clips from the pan if using. Cover the dough with a wet tea towel and allow the dough to ferment overnight at room temperature (it's okay if the wet tea towel touches the top of the loaf). Fermentation will take anywhere between 12-14 hours depending on how active your starter is and ambient temperature. In my chilly kitchen at 66F, the dough takes about 14 1/2 hours to rise overnight. There is no proof for this recipe. Go right into baking the loaf after bulk fermentation. The loaf is ready to bake when the dough increases to 1 1/2 times in size and has risen to about 1.1/2"" (3.8cm) above the lip of the pan at the center. The dough will spring back when gently pressed on top., Bake the Loaf: Place a oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 550F (288C). Lightly spray or brush the top of the dough with water and sprinkle 1-2 Tbs of rolled oats over the top. Decrease the oven temperature to 475F (246C) and bake the loaf 55-60 minutes or until the internal temperature of the bread is between 200F-205F. If the bread starts getting too dark on top, tent the bread with foil. The bread pictured here is untented. After 10 minutes out of the oven, transfer the bread to a cooling rack. Cool completely, at least for two-three hours, better if cured overnight, before slicing into it. You'll notice the bread is very hard, but will soften as it cools., How to Store and Enjoy!: After the bread is completely cool, slice it with a serrated knife. The slices can be stored at room temperature in a closed container for up to three days or frozen for longer storage. For freezer storage, slices can go from freezer to toaster directly.You'll notice the interior of the bread to be tacky. This is normal. I find this gluten free sourdough needs to be toasted before it's enjoyed... sometimes double toasted to bring out its best flavor and texture.","[, (, ', f, l, a, x,  , s, e, e, d, s, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, h, o, l, e,  , r, o, l, l, e, d,  , o, a, t, s, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', q, u, i, n, o, a, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, n, f, l, o, w, e, r,  , s, e, e, d, s, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, /, 3, ,,  , ', c, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, l, u, t, e, n,  , f, r, e, e,  , s, o, u, r, d, o, u, g, h,  , s, t, a, r, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, /, 3, ,,  , ', c,  , +,  , 2,  , t, b, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2,  , 1, /, 2, ,,  , ', c,  , +,  , 2,  , t, b, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, a, p, l, e,  , s, y, r, u, p, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, o, w, n,  , r, i, c, e,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, i, l, l, e, t,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, a, t,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1,  , 1, /, 4, ,,  , ', c, ', ), ,,  , (, ', t, a, p, i, o, c, a,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, /, 2, ,,  , ', c,  , +,  , 1,  , t, b, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, s, y, l, l, i, u, m,  , h, u, s, k,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, i, n, e,  , s, e, a,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 3,  , 1, /, 2, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, h, o, l, e,  , r, o, l, l, e, d,  , o, a, t, s, ', ,,  , 1, -, 2, ,,  , ', t, b, s, ', ), ]"

Unlike other bread recipes, the dough for this bread will feel wet and sticky rather than dry., (Optional: If you do not want any sour flavor or tang in your finished loaf, add the 1/2 tsp. of baking soda and mix until well combined. Be aware, though, that the bread will not be true sourdough bread with the addition of the baking soda.), Knead the wet dough for a minute or two. This part will be messy. I usually just keep the dough in the bowl to knead it to avoid extra mess on the counter. This type of bread doesn't need to be kneaded as thoroughly as other bread recipes., Place dough into a greased 9x5 inch bread pan. Cover with a damp dish cloth or tea towel, with another dry towel over it and let rise for about 8-14 hours, or until fully risen. You want the dish towel touching the bread to stay damp because that will help to prevent the top of the dough from drying out and forming a crust, which could prevent the dough from rising as much. (I find it convenient to prepare my bread dough in the evening and then bake it the next morning.), Once it has risen, the dough should be light and fluffy and form an indentation when you press your finger into it. (If you have a glass bread pan, you can see little bubbles in the dough through the sides and bottom of the pan.), Bake at 350 degrees for about 45-50 minutes or until bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when you tap on it.","[, (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, o, u, r, d, o, u, g, h,  , s, t, a, r, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, o, l, a, s, s, e, s, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, a, k, i, n, g,  , s, o, d, a, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ]"

If dough seems sticky after this point, add another 1/4 cup of flour at a time until dough is a soft, moist, but not gooey-sticky texture. Add another minute of mixing with every 1/4 cup of flour added., If you did not need to add additional flour after 12 minutes, just continue mixing (kneading) for a total of 15 minutes (so, about 3 more minutes at this point). It's ok to add a few minutes to kneading time if you feel dough is not soft enough, though. You should reach the windowpane stage at this point, where you can stretch a small amount of dough and see through it, and it holds up without tearing., (Note: if kneading by hand, it should take nearly double the amount of kneading time above.), Transfer to a large bowl (at least twice the size of the dough). Cover with plastic wrap, then a kitchen towel. OR cover with two thin flour sack towels (I'm transitioning to using only these in my kitchen.), Set in a warm, draft free area and let rise for approximately 1 hour., After dough has doubled or nearly doubled, divide into two equal portions. Use a little flour to shape into loaves, and place in two greased (buttered) loaf pans (or line with parchment paper). You can use regular-sized 1-lb loaf pans for taller loaves, or the longer bread pans that hold approx. 2 lbs (13x5 in) for a larger, more standard bread loaf., Brush olive oil (or olive oil cooking spray) onto plastic wrap and place over both loaf pans; top with a kitchen towel. Again, instead of plastic wrap, you can use two flour sack towels., Return pans to your warm countertop and let rise again for approximately 1 hour, or until dough is just risen above the rim of your loaf pans. The initial higher oven temp will help finish the rising process, in most cases- keep this in mind so you don't over-proof your dough., Preheat oven to 400 degrees F., Carefully remove the towel (and plastic wrap, if using this) from loaves and place in preheated oven. Bake for 10 minutes at 400 degrees., Remove from oven and use a basting brush to brush each loaf with milk., Reduce oven temperature to 350 F and put bread right back in oven (no need to wait for temp to cool). Bake for approximately 11-13 minutes or until temperature in center of each loaf reaches 200 degrees F on a digital thermometer. (If you forget to reduce oven temp, it's ok! You'll just end up with a darker crust and your overall bake time will be reduced.), Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Slice with a large serrated bread knife.

(Different types of flour retain more water), 3/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon room-temperature water, 1 teaspoon salt","Combine the starter, flour, and water in a large bowl and mix well until all of the flour is moistened and the dough has formed a cohesive mass. Add extra water or flour if needed (a little at a time) to create a soft, tacky dough., Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and let it rest for 20 minutes. This rest allows the flour to absorb the water, which starts the dough’s gluten formation and makes it easier to knead., After the rest, add the salt and knead the dough until it’s smooth and supple, though still somewhat soft and tacky to the touch., Place the dough back in the bowl, cover, and let it rise for 1 hour., Give the dough a fold: Turn it out onto a floured surface and, using a scraper or wet hands, fold it like a business letter upon itself. Turn the dough 90 degrees towards you, gently flatten it a bit, and repeat the fold., Return the dough to the bowl, cover, and let it rise for another hour., At the end of the rise, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface., Gently shape into a round and cover with a kitchen towel., Let rest for 20 more minutes., After this rest, shape the loaves into a tight round or oval by folding the dough over onto itself and placing the seam side down in your Banneton that has the liner floured., Cover and let rise in a warm spot (70-75 degrees) until light and airy, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours., About 30 minutes before the bread is ready to bake, place a small empty cast-iron skillet on the bottom rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 450., When the loaf has risen, gently turn it out onto parchment paper. Slide the parchment directly onto a baking sheet., Pour 1 cup of boiling water (I microwave it in a coffee cup for three minutes) into the cast iron pan.

Grease and lightly flour a regular loaf pan. I rub a generous amount of butter around every inch of the pan and then spoon approximately a tablespoon of flour into the pan. I then tip the pan and tap to distribute the flour. Rotate pan and tap. Continue until there is a light coating of flour on every surface., Whisk together flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder in a small bowl. Set aside. Mash bananas in a small bowl and set aside. Grate the peel of half a lemon. Be extremely careful not to get any of the bitter white pith. It will ruin the taste of your bread and we don’t want that! I am probably overly cautious and would rather use more of the lemon than risk bitter bread., Grate the peel of half a lemon. Be extremely careful not to get any of the bitter white pith. Combine with the sugar to allow the oils to begin to infuse the sugar., AHC instructs us to “work butter until soft, then work in sugar, a little at a time, until smooth.” I took this to mean mash the butter around the bowl with the back of a wooden spoon until malleable and then gradually add in sugar while continuing to mash it into the butter with the back of a wooden spoon., Beat in eggs (by hand with your wooden spoon), one at a time, add the vanilla, grated lemon rind, and mashed bananas., Stir in flour mixture alternately with sour cream. I did my usual three additions ending with sour cream. Mix in nuts being careful not to over mix., Pour into a large prepared loaf pan or two mini pans and bake in preheated oven until toothpick inserted into the center comes out with only a few clinging crumbs. The large loaf should take 45 minutes to 1 hour, while the little ones will take 25 – 35 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes in pans and then remove to cool completely on a rack., Honey Ricotta Spread:, Whisk together honey and ricotta.

092ee72a,https://www.valyastasteofhome.com/easy-soft-and-fluffy-sweet-marbled-bread-recipe/,Soft and Fluffy Sweet Marbled Bread Recipe (Easy to Make!),"1 cup – lukewarm organic whole milk, ¼ cup – sugar, 2 tsp. – dry active yeast, 5 large – eggs ((I used home-raised room temperature eggs)), ¾ cup – sugar, ¼ tsp. – sea salt, 2 tsp. – pure vanilla extract, 6 ½ cups – organic all-purpose flour, 6 oz. – unsalted butter softened to room temperature, ¼ cup – organic cacao ((or cocoa) powder), ¼ tsp. – ground cinnamon, 2 tbsp. – water, 1 large – egg","Making the Dough:, We’ll start by activating the yeast. In a bowl, combine lukewarm milk, ¼ cup of sugar (reserve ¾ cup of sugar for later), and yeast. Making sure that the milk is slightly warm will ensure that the yeast activates properly., Stir it together until the sugar and yeast dissolve. Place it in a warm place and let the yeast activate., Next, beat eggs and the remaining ¾ cup of sugar together on high speed for 5 minutes., Now reduce the mixer speed to low and add the yeast mixture to it, along with sea salt and vanilla extract., Next, switch to the dough hook attachment. Stir in sifted flour, adding ½ cup at a time, for a total of four cups. Then mix in the softened butter., As soon as the butter is mixed in, it's time to divide the dough in two. You’ll notice that the dough is not entirely done yet and it will still be pretty sticky at this point. That is absolutely okay, we will finish kneading it in a bit., Dividing the Dough:, Using a silicone spatula, split the dough into equal pieces and transfer half of the dough into a medium bowl. Set it aside. We will be adding cacao and ground cinnamon to it later after we finish mixing the white dough first., Attach the bowl back to the stand mixer. Now mix in more flour by adding ½ cup at a time, for 1 ½ cups in total. The dough should be soft and stretchy, and it should not stick to the spatula., Transfer the white well-kneaded dough into a second large bowl greased with olive oil. Cover the bowl with plastic food wrap and place it in a warm area to rise., Now it’s time to transfer the dough that you set aside back into the mixer bowl. Next, add ¼ cup cacao (or cocoa powder) and ¼ tsp of ground cinnamon., Mix everything in, by adding ½ cup of flour at a time, for a total of one cup of additional flour. Keep mixing until the dough stops sticking to the side of the bowl. The dough should be stretchy and should not stick to the bowl or spatula., Transfer the chocolate dough back into another glass bowl greased with olive oil. Place the chocolate dough next to the white dough and allow it to rise for about an hour to an hour and a half., Adding the Egg Wash:, Towards the end of the rising time, make the eggs wash. Beat an egg with water until well combined and set aside until ready for use., Braiding the Sweet Bread:, Work with one color of dough at a time. Move the white dough onto a floured surface., Knead the dough into a ball and split the white dough in half. Keep in mind that this recipe makes 2 loaves of marbled bread., Place the second half of the white dough back into the glass bowl and cover it again with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out., Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about ¼"" in thickness. Repeat the same steps with the chocolate dough as with the white. Roll it out into about the same size rectangle, ¼"" in thickness., Now place the chocolate dough on top of the white one. The chocolate dough will want to shrink, so you can just pinch the edges together sporadically, in multiple places. They do not have to be perfectly aligned as you will be rolling the dough out again., Fold the dough into vertical four folds and roll the dough out again to about ½"" in thickness., As mentioned earlier, it doesn't have to be exact or perfect. That's the beauty of working with yeast dough, it will expand in size anyway to give you a beautiful, marbled effect., Now fold that large strip of dough in half and roll it out again to about 1"" in thickness throughout the entire rectangle., Make 3 even cuts in the dough without cutting all the way through to make 3 strips for the dough to be braided., Finally, braid the marbled dough strips and tuck in the edge under the loaf. While braiding, you may turn the strips to reveal the marbled cut sides even more, if you want to., Now, place the marbled braid into a bread pan or baking sheet greased with butter and lined with parchment paper. Tuck in both ends underneath the braid to make sure it doesn’t unravel while baking., Place the dough into a warm place to proof for 45 minutes. Repeat the same instructions with the second half of the dough for your second loaf of Sweet Marbled Bread., Baking the Sweet Marbled Bread:, Start by preheating the oven to 350F (180C) 30 minutes into the final proofing time., Right before placing the bread in the oven to bake, brush both loaves of bread dough with the egg wash multiple times using a pastry brush., Bake the bread in the preheated oven at 350F (180C) for 40 to 45 minutes. Insert a long wooden toothpick into the center of the bread to check if the bread is done. If it comes out clean, then the bread is done baking., Remove from the oven and let the bread cool in the baking pans for about 15 minutes before transferring them onto a cooling rack to cool completely.","[, (, ', o, r, g, a, n, i, c,  , w, h, o, l, e,  , m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', d, r, y,  , a, c, t, i, v, e,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, s, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', l, a, r, g, e, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 7, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, e, a,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, u, r, e,  , v, a, n, i, l, l, a,  , e, x, t, r, a, c, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, r, g, a, n, i, c,  , a, l, l, -, p, u, r, p, o, s, e,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 6, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', u, n, s, a, l, t, e, d,  , b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 6, ., 0, ,,  , ', o, z, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, r, g, a, n, i, c,  , c, a, c, a, o, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, r, o, u, n, d,  , c, i, n, n, a, m, o, n, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', l, a, r, g, e, ', ), ]"

Add one cup of the banana bread batter to the melted chocolate and stir until well combined., Spoon the plain batter and chocolate batter alternately into the prepared loaf pan. Swirl the batters together with a knife (don't overdo it or the colors will get muddled -- up and back 4 to 5 times should suffice).

cd6a1467,https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/marble-loaf-cake/,Marble Loaf Cake,"2 cups (255g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled), 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 cup (8 Tbsp; 113g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature, 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar, 1/3 cup (80ml) vegetable oil, 2 large eggs, at room temperature, 1/4 cup (60g) full-fat sour cream, at room temperature, 1 Tablespoon pure vanilla extract (yes, 1 Tbsp!), 2/3 cup + 2 Tablespoons (190ml) whole milk, divided and at room temperature, 3 Tablespoons (16g) unsweetened natural or dutch-process cocoa powder, optional but recommended: 1/2 teaspoon espresso powder, one 4-ounce (113g) quality semi-sweet chocolate bar, finely chopped (see note), 6 Tablespoons (90ml) heavy cream or heavy whipping cream (see note)","Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and generously grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan., Make the cake batter, Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together. Set aside., Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the oil and beat until combined. The mixture will still be quite creamy. Add the eggs and beat on high speed for 1 minute and then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. The mixture will be lumpy—that’s ok. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer to low speed and as the mixer runs, slowly pour in 2/3 cup (160ml) milk. Beat on low speed just until all of the ingredients are combined. Do not over-mix. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no large lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick., You’ll have around 3-3.5 cups of batter. Transfer a little less than half (just eyeball it, doesn’t need to be perfect) to another bowl. Stir in the remaining 2 Tablespoons (30ml) milk, the cocoa powder, and espresso powder., Layer and swirl the batters, Spread a thin layer of the plain vanilla batter in the bottom of your prepared loaf pan. Now you will layer spoonfuls of each batter on top—cover bottom vanilla layer with a few spoonfuls of the chocolate batter, then a few spoonfuls of the vanilla batter, then more chocolate batter, then more vanilla batter, and so on until all of the cake batter is used. Gently shimmy the pan to level out the batters. Using a knife, make rounded horizontal zig-zags from one side of the pan to the other and then make rounded vertical zig-zags from the top to the bottom., Bake for about 65-75 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. That time is a guideline—all ovens differ, so keep a close eye on the cake after 55 minutes. If the cake is browning too quickly on top, loosely tent with aluminum foil as it bakes., Cool cake in the pan set on a wire rack for 30 minutes before removing from the pan. Note that the cake slightly sinks as it cools and that’s completely normal. Feel free to continue cooling the cake directly on a wire rack or you can top it and slice it while it’s still slightly warm after 30 minutes cooling inside the pan., As the cake cools, make the ganache topping, Place the chocolate and cream in a medium heat-safe bowl set over a medium saucepan of simmering water. (Or use a double boiler if you have one.) Do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water. Stir frequently until chocolate has melted and ganache is smooth. Remove from heat and set aside at room temperature for 20-30 minutes or until slightly thickened., Drizzle or spread topping on cake. Topping sets into a fudge-like consistency after several hours., Cover leftovers tightly and store cake (with or without topping) at room temperature for 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.","[, (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 2, 5, 5, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, a, k, i, n, g,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, 1, 3, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, 0, 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, i, l, ', ,,  , 8, 0, ,,  , ', m, l, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, s, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', s, o, u, r,  , c, r, e, a, m, ', ,,  , 6, 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', v, a, n, i, l, l, a,  , e, x, t, r, a, c, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 1, 9, 0, ,,  , ', m, l, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, o, c, o, a,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, 6, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, s, p, r, e, s, s, o,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, h, o, c, o, l, a, t, e, ', ,,  , 1, 1, 3, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, r, e, a, m, ', ,,  , 9, 0, ,,  , ', m, l, ', ), ]"

dbc26382,https://abeautifulmess.com/how-to-make-marbled-rainbow-toast/,Marbled Rainbow Bread,"1 ¼ cups warm water, a big pinch of sugar (1/8 teaspoon or so), 2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast, 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 3 colors of food dye, liquid or gel","First stir the sugar in with the water. Then sprinkle the yeast over the top of the water and let that sit and activate for a few minutes. The yeast should start to foam a little bit, like in the photo above. That’s how you know it’s working. The sugar in the water just gives the yeast a little something to get it going. Think of it like a cup of coffee in the morning—not necessary, but it certainly helps to get things started., In a large bowl stir together the flour and salt. Pour the yeast water in with the flour mixture and stir until just combined, so the mixture is like a loose dough. We’re going to knead the color into the dough, so you only need to stir it enough here so that it’s combined., Divide the dough into three or more equal parts, depending on how many colors you want to use. I would recommend at least three, but you could use more if you like. Place the dough section on a cutting board or covered surface dusted with flour. I also recommend wearing gloves during this part. Add the food coloring to the dough and knead it in so the color gets well dispersed throughout. If you’ve ever colored fondant before, this will be a very similar process., I tried both gel and liquid food colors because I was curious if one would be easier to work with. I actually had assumed the gel would work better, as that’s usually what works best in fondant or frostings. But I actually liked working with the liquid food dye a little better. It’s easier to spill, so do take care to cover your surfaces and wear gloves (an apron doesn’t hurt either), but I thought it blended into the dough a little better. For the teal and blue doughs (above), I used gel coloring, but the yellow was a liquid coloring., Both work well though, so if you already have one or the other at your house, don’t be afraid to use it. Oh, and if you want to mix two colors together, I would recommend mixing them in a small bowl or something first and then kneading that into your dough as it will more evenly create the color you are going for., Once you have colored all of the dough, roll each section into a small log or thick snake (think elementary school pottery class). Then twist them all together and roll into a ball. Again, this is pretty similar to the marbled clay ring dishes I linked above, but you just don’t flatten it like you do for the bowls. Just leave it in a ball, place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and allow to rise in a warm spot for an hour or until doubled in size., Gently deflate the dough (it will have risen by this point) and shape into a loaf. If you can shape in a way so the darker colors are on the outside, I would recommend it because the crust will brown as the bread bakes, so it will be more noticeable on lighter colors. But this is just something to try if you can, no big deal if not., Place in a lightly buttered loaf pan, cover, and allow to rise for another hour., Then bake at 400°F for 25-28 minutes until the top has lightly browned. Allow to cool before slicing.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 1, 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, o, o, d,  , d, y, e, ', ,,  , 3, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ]"

Cover the jar and keep it at a warm temperature for 5 hours., Autolyse, (1:00 p.m)In a mixing bowl, add the Autolyse ingredients until no dry bits remain. Cover the bowl and let rest for 1-hour., Mix, (2:00 p.m.)Add the salt and levain to the top of the dough in autolyse and use a splash of the remaining water to moisten. With wet hands, mix thoroughly. Add the remaining water if the dough feels like it can handle it. Knead the dough for a few minutes using either the slap and fold technique or folds in the bowl until the dough smooths and becomes elastic. Transfer the dough back into the bowl. Transfer the dough to a bulk fermentation container and cover., Bulk Fermentation, (2:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.)This dough will require 2 sets of stretches and folds during bulk fermentation at 30-minute intervals. After the second set, let the dough rest, covered, for the remainder of bulk fermentation., Divide and Preshape, (5:30 p.m.)Scrape the dough out to a clean work surface. Use water and a wet hand, and your bench knife, divide the dough in half. Lightly shape each half into a round shape and let rest for 30 minutes, uncovered., Shape, (6:00 p.m.)Flour the top of the preshaped round and your work surface. Using your bench knife, flip one of the rounds over onto the floured area. Using floured hands, shape the dough into a bâtard. Gently transfer the dough to a 14-inch long proofing basket, seam-side up. Repeat with the remaining round., Proof, (6:30 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. the next day)Cover proofing baskets with reusable plastic, seal, and place into the refrigerator overnight., Bake, (The next day, 9:00 a.m.)Place an oven rack in the bottom-third of the oven. Due to their oval shape, I baked these loaves in my long Challenger bread pan. Using my oven-steaming technique, you could also bake them directly on a baking surface. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C) for 30 minutes. Take one of the proofing baskets out of the fridge, uncover it, and put a piece of parchment paper over the basket. Place a pizza peel or inverted baking sheet on top of the parchment and, using both hands, flip everything over. Gently remove the basket and score the dough. Slide the dough into the oven. Steam the oven: either cover the Challenger bread pan or pour ice into the preheated pan at the bottom of the oven. Bake for 20 minutes. Vent the steam oven: uncover the Challenger bread pan and remove the lid or remove the steaming pans. Continue to bake for 30 minutes more. When done, the loaf should have an internal temperature of around 204°F (95°C), and the crust should be deeply colored. Let the loaves cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing.","[, ', (, b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ), ', ,,  , 7, 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ,,  , ', (, w, a, t, e, r, ), ', ,,  , 7, 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ,,  , ', (, r, i, p, e,  , s, o, u, r, d, o, u, g, h,  , s, t, a, r, t, e, r, ), ', ,,  , 3, 6, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ,,  , ', (, b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ), ', ,,  , 9, 2, 4, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ,,  , ', (, d, i, a, s, t, a, t, i, c,  , m, a, l, t,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ), ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ,,  , ', (, w, a, t, e, r, ), ', ,,  , 6, 2, 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ,,  , ', (, w, a, t, e, r, ), ', ,,  , 5, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ,,  , ', (, f, i, n, e,  , s, e, a,  , s, a, l, t, ), ', ,,  , 1, 8, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ,,  , ', (, r, i, p, e,  , l, e, v, a, i, n, ), ', ,,  , 1, 8, 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ]"

d9570205,https://theloopywhisk.com/2020/08/16/gluten-free-marbled-banana-bread/,Gluten Free Marbled Banana Bread,"330 g (1 1/2 cups) mashed bananas (3 medium bananas), 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice, 150 g (1 1/3 sticks) unsalted butter, melted, 75 g (3/8 cup) light brown sugar, 75 g (3/8 cup) caster/superfine sugar, 2 UK medium/ US large eggs, room temperature, 1 tsp vanilla paste ((or 2 tsp vanilla extract)), 225 g (1 3/4 cups + 2 tbsp) plain gluten free flour blend, 50 g (1/2 cup) almond flour, 1/4 tsp xanthan gum ((omit if your GF flour blend already contains xanthan)), 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 3/4 tsp baking soda, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, pinch of ground nutmeg, 75 g (2.6 oz) dark chocolate, 60-70% cocoa solids, melted and cooled, 12 g (2 tbsp) Dutch processed cocoa powder","Adjust the oven rack to the middle position, pre-heat the oven to 355ºF (180ºC) and line a 2lb/900g loaf baking tin with greaseproof/baking paper. (Dimensions of the loaf tin: 8inch/21cm long, 4inch/11cm wide and 3inch/7cm high.), Mix the mashed bananas with the lemon juice (to prevent oxidation and browning) and set aside., In a bowl, whisk together the melted butter and both sugars until pale and fluffy., Add the mashed bananas, eggs and vanilla paste, and whisk until well combined., Sift together the plain gluten free flour blend, almond flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg, and add them to the wet ingredients. Whisk or stir well until you get a smooth batter with no flour clumps., Spoon out 1/3 of the batter and mix into it the melted cooled chocolate and Dutch processed cocoa powder, until well combined., Alternately spoon the two batters into the lined loaf tin until no batter remains (see post above for photos on how to do this). Then, use a skewer or knife to swirl the batter around the tin – make sure you reach all the way to the bottom of the tin. Don’t be shy about giving the batter a generous swirl, but also don’t over-swirl it, as it can destroy the effect of having two distinct batters., Bake in the pre-heated oven at 355 ºF (180 ºC) for about 60 minutes, or until well risen, golden brown on top and an inserted toothpick/skewer comes out clean or with a few stray crumbs attached. If the banana bread starts browning too quickly or too much, cover it with aluminium foil (shiny side up) and continue baking until done. It's best to cover it with aluminium foil when it starts becoming a deep golden colour., Once baked, allow it to cool in the tin for 5 - 10 minutes, then remove out of the tin and allow to cool completely on a wire cooling rack. (Although it's rather wonderful still slightly warm.), Storage: The gluten free marbled banana bread keeps well in a closed container in a cool dry place for 3 - 4 days.","[, (, ', b, a, n, a, n, a, s, ', ,,  , 3, 3, 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', l, e, m, o, n,  , j, u, i, c, e, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', u, n, s, a, l, t, e, d,  , b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, 5, 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', l, i, g, h, t,  , b, r, o, w, n,  , s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 7, 5, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, a, s, t, e, r,  , s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 7, 5, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, s, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', v, a, n, i, l, l, a,  , p, a, s, t, e, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, l, a, i, n,  , g, l, u, t, e, n,  , f, r, e, e,  , f, l, o, u, r,  , b, l, e, n, d, ', ,,  , 2, 2, 5, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', a, l, m, o, n, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 5, 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', x, a, n, t, h, a, n,  , g, u, m, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, a, k, i, n, g,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, a, k, i, n, g,  , s, o, d, a, ', ,,  , 0, ., 7, 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, i, n, n, a, m, o, n, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', n, u, t, m, e, g, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', d, a, r, k,  , c, h, o, c, o, l, a, t, e, ', ,,  , 7, 5, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, o, c, o, a,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, 2, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ]"

Warm the milk, sugar, oil, and salt just until warm (try 40 sec in the microwave first and then go from there)., Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and beat it with a mixer for 30 seconds on low stopping to scrape the bowl often. Beat on high for about 2-3 minutes., Divide the batter in half and stir in as much of 1 cup of all-purpose flour as you can to 1 half of the dough. Turn that half out on to a floured surface and knead in more all-purpose flour (you won't be using it all, no worries!) until you get a dough that is smooth and springy (about 6-8 min by hand but only a couple with a stand mixer). Form it into a bowl and put it into a greased bowl to rise (cover the bowl) in a warm location (a sunny window is great!),, To the other half of the dough stir in the molasses, rye flour, stir in as much of the remaining all-purpose flour (probably about 1/2 cup) as you can. Turn it out to a floured surface, knead it just like the other half, and place it into a greased bowl. Let both portions rise in a warm place for about 1 to 1 ¼ hours or until the dough has doubled in size., PUnch the portions down after it has risen. Cover and let rest for about 10 minutes. (kids love helping punch down the dough!), On a lightly floured surface, roll out each half of the dough into a rectangle about 8 inch by 12 in size. Put the dark dough on top of the light and roll it up starting on the shortest side (you want your dough to be shorter rather than longer). Place it in a greased 8inch loaf pan (seam-side down). Cover and let rise until nearly double (20-30minutes), Bake in a 375 oven for 30-35 minutes. Trick: if you tap the bread and it sounds hollow, it is done. Let it cool for a couple beats and then immediately take it out. NOTE: some readers have needed to bake their bread for around 45 minutes. So give yourself plenty of time, if needed., Hint: if you think the bread needs more baking but it is already quite brown...cover the top with aluminum foil for additional baking without browning.","[, (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', o, z, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, o, o, k, i, n, g,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 2, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, o, l, a, s, s, e, s, ', ,,  , 2, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', r, y, e,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ]"

In my case it took 4 1/2 hours at 71,6º F (22ºC)., Dump the dough on a work surface sprinkled with flour and roll out the dough. We will form a rectangle of 14 x 7 inches (36 x 18 cm)., Take the chocolate sheet out from the freezer, remove the film and place it in the middle of the dough. The width of the chocolate sheet and the width of the dough will be the same., Fold the ends of the dough over the chocolate sheet and bring each of them to the center. Seal the joint of both folds well both in the centre and on the sides. The dough must be completely sealed on each side., Lightly sprinkle the work surface with flour and proceed to stretch the dough. Pass the roll of a single pass, from the center towards the ends, and avoiding insisting in the same place., As we stretch the dough, we will try to lift this from the work table from time to time to make sure it does not stick to the table (it could damage the final layers making breaks). In case it is necessary to sprinkle a little flour, we will do it without exceeding., Stretch until reaching about 16 x 7 inches (40 x 18 cm)., Make the first fold, take one end to the center and repeat the same process with the other end placing it on the previous one. Just as if we were closing a triptych., Roll gently on the surface to join the folds., Sprinkle the work surface lightly with flour and strain the dough., Put pressure on it but without overdoing it., Stretch again until reaching the same length as the previous time, 16 x 7 inches (40 x 18 cm), Fold in the same way as the previous time., Cover with film and refrigerate for 30 minutes., Sprinkle the work surface lightly with flour and stretch the dough. We will give dimensions of 10 x 8 inches (25 x 20 cm) approximately., We will make three longitudinal cuts in the dough without being able to cut one of the ends completely. This will keep the braid together., These three strips, we will cut them in two, so that in total we will obtain 6 strips., Braid following the process of the video., Insert the ends and sides towards the bottom of the piece and place them in a pan lined with baking paper., Preheat the oven to 355ºF (180ºC)., After the first 20 minutes, keep an eye on the bread.

Let it sit until foamy, about 15 minutes., Whisk together bread (or all purpose) flour, 25 gram sugar, and salt (if using unsalted butter) in a mixing bowl., Once the yeast solution is foamy, make a well in the flour mixture, crack the egg into the well and pour the yeast solution. Knead until soft, elastic, and non-sticky. If the dough feels too tacky (sticky), add a bit of flour (@10 gram increment). It is common for yeast dough to be tacky at first, but if your persist, at about 10-15 minutes of kneading time, the dough should have formed enough gluten to make it more elastic and less sticky. So try not to add flour at the very early stage of kneading., Add butter into the dough, knead again until the dough is not oily. It should take another 10-15 minutes., Divide the dough into 3 equal portions. Keep one portion plain. Take one portion and add matcha paste, knead until the dough has a uniform green color. Take the last portion of dough and add chocolate paste, knead until the dough has a uniform chocolate color. Shape each portion into a ball. Place in a large plate (or baking tray) lined with parchment paper, set them aside from each other so they don't touch and transfer color from one dough to another. Cover with a wet kitchen towel/saran wrap. Proof until the volume is doubled, about 1 hour in a warm kitchen., Grease one 9"" loaf pan with butter/oil., Punch each dough to release air bubbles, and knead for 2 minutes. Shape each dough into a log slightly longer than the length of loaf pan., Place three logs of dough side by side and braid. Place the braided bread dough into the greased pan. Cover pan with a wet kitchen towel/saran wrap, and proof again until the dough rise to the top of the pan, about 1 hour in a warm kitchen., Preheat oven to 180 Celsius (350 Fahrenheit). Brush the top of the bread dough with egg wash. Bake in preheated oven for 35-40 minutes.

Set aside., Whisk eggs, Whisk together in a separate bowl the eggs and the sugar until the mixture thickens slightly and takes on a pale yellow color. This could take a few minutes. If you’re feeling lazy, use an electric mixer for this step., Whisk wet ingredients, Whisk the oil and vanilla into the egg mixture until fully combined., Fold dry ingredients, Pour the dry ingredients over the egg mixture. Using a rubber spatula, fold/stir just until the dry ingredients are no longer visible. Hold on to that bowl that had the dry ingredients., Mix in cocoa, Pour approximately ⅓ to ¼ of the dough into the empty bowl that had your dry ingredients. Using your rubber spatula, mix in the cocoa powder and milk just until fully incorporated., Rest dough, Cover both bowls with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least two hours and up to overnight. (Can you skip this step? Sure. The dough may be a bit more difficult to work with though.), Preheat your oven to 350°F., Pepare baking sheets, Line two baking sheets with parchment paper., Shape dough, Divide the vanilla portion of the dough into 4 logs, shaping each log approximately 2-3 inches wide, and place two on each baking sheet. (Tip: If the dough is too sticky, lightly wet your hands prior to handling the dough. This is a very sticky dough, and the water will make your life much easier to shape the dough. Alternatively, you can lightly flour your hands. I prefer to use water because I would rather add moisture to the dough rather than make it drier with flour.) Divide the chocolate dough into quarters and mold each quarter into a log the length of the vanilla dough. (The chocolate dough will be slightly easier to work with because the cocoa powder will have absorbed some of the moisture from the dough.) Place the chocolate logs in the centers of the two vanilla logs, or place over the vanilla dough in a zigzag. With wet hands, shape the dough logs., Bake for 30-35 minutes. The vanilla portion of the dough should be slightly browned on top and more browned along the bottom edges. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Slice them diagonally, approximately ½ inch thick each. Allow to cool to room temperature.

Gently lift the towel up between the baguettes to create separation between the loaves. Sprinkle the baguettes lightly with flour, and gently lay another clean towel on top. Let rise for one hour at room temperature., Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 500°F with a pizza stone on the middle rack. Place a small cast iron pan on the bottom rack. Boil a kettle of water. Set aside., After the baguettes have risen, transfer to a piece of parchment paper. Slash the tops of the baguettes with a lame or a sharp chef's knife. The cuts should be at a sharp angle going down the axis of the baguette. Place the parchment paper directly onto the preheated pizza stone.Be sure to wear thick oven mitts for this next step. While the oven door is open, pour the hot water from the kettle into the preheated cast iron pan. There will be a big burst of hot steam, so do this carefully. Slide the pan of water into the oven to create steam in the oven while the baguettes bake. Close the oven door immediately., Bake for 20-25 minutes, rotating halfway if necessary, until the the crust is deeply golden brown, mahogany in places. Allow the baguettes to cool completely before slicing.

b358d546,https://thymewithcaroline.com/marbled-banana-bread/,Marbled Banana Bread,"1¾ cups all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1 cup granulated sugar, 8 tbsp unsalted butter ((1 stick), melted), 2 eggs, 2 large, overripe bananas (mashed), ½ cup plain Greek yogurt, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 9 oz melted dark chocolate (or 7 dark chocolate Dove candies), 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder","Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line the bread pan with parchment paper., In a mixing bowl, whisk together the melted butter and granulated sugar until well incorporated, about 30 seconds., Add both eggs to the bowl and whisk vigorously for at least 30 seconds. The batter should lighten in color and appear smooth and homogenous., Add the bananas and smash any lumps out with your whisk., Add the Greek yogurt, cinnamon and vanilla extract to the bowl and whisk together until well incorporated., In another mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Then add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and use a rubber spatula to mix together until just incorporated. Don't overmix., Melt your dark chocolate in a bowl in the microwave, 30 seconds at a time until completely smooth. Then add the cocoa powder to the chocolate and stir together with a spoon until combined., Take about 1 cup of the banana bread batter and add it to the chocolate mixture. Stir together until combined., Prepare the bread. Spoon the plain banana bread mixture in large tablespoons in a zigzag pattern, leaving gaps throughout. Then, fill those gaps with the chocolate batter. Repeat the process until you run out., Take your knife or skewer and gently stick it through the batter. Swirl it carefully through the bread, and don't over do it! The more you swirl it, the more the colors will combine into one. Less swirling will create more contrast., Place the pan in the oven and bake for 55 minutes, or until a bread knife comes out clean when inserted. Let cool completely and slice!

45b2832a,https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/classic-baguettes-recipe,Classic Baguettes,"1/2 cup (113g) water cool, 1/16 teaspoon (a pinch) active dry yeast or instant yeast*, 1 cup (120g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour*, 1 cup + 2 tablespoons (255g) water lukewarm, all of the starter, 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast or instant yeast, 3 1/2 cups (420g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour*, 2 teaspoons (12g) table salt","Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a large bowl, combine the starter ingredients.,       , , To make the starter: Mix everything together to make a soft dough. Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 14 hours; overnight works well. The starter should have expanded and become bubbly.,       , , To make the dough: Mix and knead everything together — by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough. If you're using a stand mixer, knead for about 4 minutes on medium-low speed (speed 2 on a KitchenAid); the finished dough should stick a bit at the bottom of the bowl.,       , , Place the dough in a lightly greased medium-sized bowl, cover the bowl, and let the dough rest and rise for 45 minutes. Gently deflate the dough and fold its edges into the center, then turn it over in the bowl before letting it rise for an additional 45 minutes, until it's noticeably puffy.,       , , Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Gently deflate it, and divide it into three equal pieces., Round each piece of dough into a rough ball by pulling the edges into the center. Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes; or for up to 1 hour, if that works better with your schedule.,       , , Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough slightly then fold it nearly (but not quite) in half, sealing the edges with the heel of your hand.,       , , Turn the dough around 180° and repeat: fold, then flatten. Repeat this whole process again; the dough should have started to elongate itself., With the seam side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 16"" log. Your goal is a 15"" baguette, so 16"" allows for the slight shrinkage you'll see once you're done rolling. Taper each end of the log slightly to create the baguette's typical ""pointy"" end.,       , , Place the logs seam-side down onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined sheet pan or pans; or into the folds of a heavily floured cotton dish towel (or couche). Cover them with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the loaves to rise until they're slightly puffy (""marshmallow-y"" is the term we use in our baking school). The loaves should certainly look lighter and less dense than when you first shaped them, but won't be anywhere near doubled in bulk. This should take about 45 minutes to an hour at room temperature (about 68°F).  ,         ,   , , Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450°F with a cast iron pan on the floor of the oven, or on the lowest rack. If you're using a baking stone, place it on a middle rack. Start to heat 1 1/2 cups water to boiling., If your baguettes have risen in a dish towel or couche, gently roll them (seam-side up) onto a transfer peel and then roll back over onto a piece of parchment, seam-side down. If you don't have a transfer peel, roll the baguettes onto a piece of parchment (seam-side down) and then place the parchment on a baking sheet. ,       , , Using a baker's lame (a special curved blade) or a very sharp knife held at about a 45° angle, make three to five long lengthwise slashes in each baguette.,       , , Load the baguettes into the oven. If you’re baking on a stone, use a baker’s peel to transfer the baguettes, parchment and all, onto the hot stone. Carefully pour the boiling water into the cast iron pan, and quickly shut the oven door. The billowing steam created by the boiling water will help the baguettes rise, and give them a lovely, shiny crust., Bake the baguettes — on the pan, or on a stone — for 24 to 28 minutes, or until they're a very deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven and cool them on a rack. Or, for the very crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, crack it open about 2"", and allow the baguettes to cool completely in the oven, until both baguettes and oven are at room temperature.  ,         ,   , , Storage information: Store any leftover baguettes in a paper bag overnight; freeze for longer storage. Thaw and reheat just before serving.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 0, 6, 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 1, 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, t, a, r, t, e, r, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ]"

Place the yeast and rye flour in a medium bowl and cover with the water. Submerge the onion and caraway seeds into the water mixture. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and allow to sit overnight., To make the doughs: Get out two small bowls and place 1 ½ Tbsp yeast and 1 tsp sugar in each one. Add 1 cup lukewarm water and allow to sit around 10 minutes, until it becomes foamy on top., In a large bowl or stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, mix together 1 cup rye flour, ½ cup all-purpose flour, the caraway seeds, salt and sugar. After the water-yeast mixture has become foamy, add to flour mixture along with oil and ½ cup of the starter (you will remove the onion-caraway seeds before using). Mix thoroughly., Add another ½ cup of rye flour and ½ cup of all-purpose flour and eggs and mix until smooth., Switch to the dough hook attachment if you are using a stand mixer., Add the remaining ½ cup rye and another ½ cup all-purpose flour, mixing thoroughly and then remove from bowl and place on a floured surface. Knead remaining flour into dough, continuing to knead for around 3-5 minutes. Try not to add too much flour., Place dough in a greased bowl and cover with damp towel., Repeat all these steps with the darker dough, but add molasses and honey at the same time as you add the vegetable oil., Allow both doughs to rise at least 3 hours., Preheat oven to 350 degrees., Split each dough in half, and then divide each half into three even strands. I like using half of the darker dough and half of the lighter in each loaf to create a marbled effect., Braid challah into desired shape. Allow challah to rise another 45-60 minutes, or until you can see the size has grown and challah seems light. This step is very important to ensure a light and fluffy challah., In a small bowl beat 1 egg yolk, 1 egg, ½ tsp water and 1 tsp honey. Brush egg wash liberally over challah using a pastry brush or your fingers.. Sprinkle with thick sea salt and caraway seeds., Bake each challah around 27-29 minutes., Love Jewish food?

9a0d20dd,https://thepracticalkitchen.com/small-batch-mini-baguette-bread/,Small Batch Baguette Recipe,"120 grams all-purpose flour, 3 grams diamond crystal kosher salt, 3 grams instant yeast ((4 grams active dry yeast)), 96 grams warm water","Mixing. Mix the flour, salt, and yeast together in a mixing bowl. Pour the water into the middle of the dry ingredients and mix until combined. Gather it into a messy, sticky ball in the bottom of the bowl. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes., First set of folds. With a damp hand, grab the top edge of the dough and stretch it away from the bowl. Then fold it down over the center of the dough. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn and repeat. Repeat two more times, so you've gone all the way around the dough. Flip the dough over so the seam side faces down. Cover and rest 30 minutes., Second set of folds. Repeat the same folding process as before, going all the way around the bowl. Flip the dough so the seam side is down. Cover and rest 1 hour. The dough will double or triple in size and become quite bubbly and airy., At the end of the hour, preheat the oven to 450°F with a covered Dutch oven inside., Shaping. Dust the top of the dough in the bowl with flour, then turn it out onto a lightly floured countertop. Dust the now top side of the dough lightly with flour, just enough to keep it from sticking to you. Loosely stretch the dough into a rectangle with the long side facing you. Fold the top third of the dough down and use the heel of your hand or your fingertips to seal the edge. Lift the dough and rotate it so the folded edge is now the side closest to you. Again fold the top third of the dough down and seal the edge. Finally, fold the top edge of the dough down to fold the dough in half, sealing the two edges together against the counter. The dough will naturally elongate as you work through the folding process. Dust in extra flour as needed to prevent it from sticking to your hands., Tapering. Roll the dough forward so the seam is underneath. Give the dough one quick roll from the center out to even it out. Then taper the ends by rolling the ends with your hands angled so your pinkies are against the counter. Make sure the baguette isn't longer than your Dutch oven or baking vessel — it will need to fit inside!, Final rest. Dust a clean kitchen towel with flour and gently lift the baguette onto it. Pinch the towel so that it stands up on either side of the length of the baguette to hold it in shape. (Optional: Use binder clips to loosely secure the towel in place, providing room for the baguette to expand as it rises). Cover the baguette with plastic wrap or place it inside a large plastic bag to prevent it from drying out. Let it rise for 30 minutes while the oven preheats., Preheat the oven to 450°F with a covered Dutch oven inside. Fill a small spray bottle with water, get out your lame, and clear a space to put the Dutch oven when you take it out to put the baguette inside., Scoring. Use the dish towel to gently roll the baguette onto a half sheet of parchment paper so it lies on a diagonal corner-to-corner. Score vertically along the length of the baguette. Quickly spray the loaf all over with water and transfer into the hot Dutch oven, spray with more water, and cover immediately., Bake. Bake for 10 minutes covered (don't peek!), 10 minutes uncovered, and then an additional 2-3 minutes directly on the rack if your baguette needs a bit more color., Transfer the fully baked loaf to a cooling rack and let cool before slicing.","[, (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, 2, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 9, 6, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ]"

Add your egg, milk, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, vanilla and blend together with a whisk until combined well and batter is smooth. Set aside while you make your chocolate batter., Make you chocolate batter:, In a large bowl, whisk together almond flour, Swerve, cocoa powder, baking powder and gelatin. Add your egg, milk, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, vanilla and blend together with whisk until combined well and batter is smooth., We poured a very thin layer of the vanilla batter to start, then mismatched the chocolate and vanilla. You can’t go wrong, it always comes out in an interesting pattern. This is a smaller loaf, if you’re using the 1 pound loaf pan, the batter will come up just 1/3 of the way to the top. It will double in size during baking., Remove from oven and transfer your bread to the freezer to cool-about 30 minutes., While you’re waiting for the bread to cool, go ahead and mix together your glaze:, In a medium to large mixing bowl, add your melted butter, vanilla and milk. Sift cocoa, Swerve Confectioner and salt over the top. Blend with a hand mixer or whisk until smooth. If you wish to thicken the glaze, place it into the freezer for 5 minutes–the melted butter will harden, firming up the glaze., Spread glaze over cooled bread and serve., Enjoy! Store any leftovers in an airtight container and place in refrigerator., *These can also be made as muffins, keep in mind baking time will decrease to about 20-25 min.

Set aside and allow the yeast to dissolve and become foamy., Place the bread flour into a large bowl and stir in the salt., Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, and stir in the dissolved yeast., Add the cool water, a little at a time, while stirring, just until a stiff, shaggy dough (watch the video below to see what this should look like) has formed (you may not need to use all of the water)., Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow it to rest for 30 minutes., Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface, gently press it into a rectangle, and fold the short sides into the center. Flatten, turn 90 degrees, and repeat., Place the dough in a large oiled bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Allow it to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk (about 1 to 2 hours)., Divide the dough into 4 equal portions, and shape each one into a long loaf (about 15-inches long and 1 1/2-inches in diameter), with pointed ends., Place the loaves on a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover with oiled plastic wrap, and allow to rise until doubled in bulk (about 30 to 45 minutes)., Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F, and place a pan of water on the bottom rack., Uncover the baguettes, sprinkle them lightly with flour, and make 4 elongated slashes down each one with a lame, razor, or sharp knife., Bake the breads until crusty and brown (approx. 30 to 40 minutes).

28fb8f14,https://www.blessthismessplease.com/french-baguette-recipe/,Classic French Baguette Recipe,"1 1/2 cups + 2 tablespoons cool water (370 grams), 1 tablespoon honey (25 grams), 1 teaspoon instant yeast (3 grams), 3 1/2 cups all-purpose Bob's Red Mill or King Arthur Flour brand flour (500 grams), 2 teaspoon fine sea salt (10 grams)","In a medium mixing bowl add the water and honey to the bowl and stir to combine., Add the yeast, flour, and salt to the bowl and use a wooden spoon to mix well. The dough will be thick, just stir it as well as you can until the flour is incorporated. No need to mix a lot by hand at this point, just get it to come together., Cover the bowl (use a lid, beeswax wrap, or some good cling wrap) and let the dough rest for 30 minutes., After 30 or so minutes stretch and fold the dough. When I say ""stretch and fold"", here's what you do: put your hand between the dough and the bowl on one side and grab the dough, gently pull it up to give it a good stretch (if the dough starts to break, stop pulling, your are just stretching the dough as far as it wants to stretch without breaking it) and then fold it back down into the middle of the bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat the process, working your way around the bowl. I normally think of the bowl as a square and stretch and pull the dough 4 times, once on each side of my square. It'll take 15 or so seconds to do this., Over the next 2-3 hours, every 30 to 45 minutes, do a stretch and fold with the dough. Be sure to cover the dough well after each session. Do around 4 stretch and fold sessions total (a little more won't hurt anything)., See the bakers schedule in the post for more information on how and when I do this (I normally make my dough while I'm making dinner and stretch and fold throughout the evening)., After you have stretched and folded the dough, cover the dough well and place it in the fridge for the next 12-18 hours., You have some flexibility about how long the dough is in the fridge, so feel free to make the baking schedule work with your schedule. I adjust the next days baking depending on when we want to eat the baguettes. If they are for lunch, I'll get the dough out of the fridge 3 hours before we want to eat lunch. If I want them for dinner, I'll get the dough out 3 hours before dinner. If do don't have a set time you want to eat them, you can just do these next steps when you have about a three hour chunk of time to dedicate to it (not all hands-on time but you'll need to be around for things)., Remove the dough from the fridge after it's 12 to 18 hour rest, and remove it from the bowl., Divide the dough into three even pieces., Gently press each piece of dough into a rectangular shape about 1 inch thick. If the dough is very sticky feel free to lightly flour your surface. Cover the pressed out dough pieces with a clean dish towel and allow to rise for 1 hour., After the dough has rest for an hour at room temperature, it's time to shape your loaves. Working with one piece of dough, stretch the dough gently so that it makes a rectangle that is roughly 11 inches by 8 inches. Fold one third of the dough to the middle of the rectangle, fold the other side of the rectangle into the middle of the dough (like you are folding a letter) and then pinch the dough together along the seem to make a log (I have step by step photos of this in the blog post)., Use both of your hands to gently roll the dough out into a 15 inch long log, tapering the ends just a bit with your hands., Place the prepared dough log into your baguette pan., Repeat with remaining dough., Cover the dough in the pan with a clean dish towel and let rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until the dough is light and puffy (it won't be quite doubled in size)., While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 500 degrees F. When you turn the oven on to preheat, add a small dish of water to the oven. I like to use a bread pan that has about 2 inches of water in it. I put it off to one side of the oven so that my baguette pan can fit next to it. I like to let the oven and water preheat for at least 30 minutes so that it has time to get good and hot., When the bread has finished rising in the baguette pan, use a razor blade or lame to cut 3 diagonal slashes 1/2 inch deep diagonally across each loaf OR cut one long 1/2 inch deep slash down the center of each loaf (I like the center slit personally)., Place the bread in the hot oven, being careful when you open the oven as it is hot and steamy., Close the oven door and reduce the heat to 450 degrees F. right away., Let the baguettes cook until they are deep golden brown, 24-28 minutes (I like 25 minutes on the dot). They are going to be very golden!, Remove the baguettes from the oven and allow to cool 10-15 minutes before serving warm., Baguettes are also delicious at room temperature but we have found that we like them eaten fresh they day they are made., Uneaten baguettes can be stored wrapped in a clean towel and make excellent bread for sandwiches. They also reheat well by wrapping them in foil and letting them warm in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, o, n, e, y, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ]"

Butter a 9×5-inch loaf pan, or coat it with a nonstick baking spray- alternately you can line the loaf pan with parchment., Cut two banana strips for decorating the top of the cake and set aside., Melt butter in the bottom of a large bowl in the microwave. Mash the remaining bananas directly into the butter until mostly smooth. Whisk in brown sugar, egg, and baking soda until thoroughly combined. Add 1 cup of the flour. Stir just until it disappears., Pour half of batter into a second bowl. (You can eyeball it, it’s fine. Or you can know that my batter halves were roughly 365 grams each, but weights will vary with banana sizes.) Into one bowl, stir the 2 Tablespoons of flour and the Tajin chile lime salt. In the other bowl, stir in the cocoa powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and ground cinnamon., Drop alternating blobs of tajin and chocolate batter into the prepared baking pan, then marbleize by using a spoon or small offset spatula to gently turn the batter over in three places down the length of the pan, you can swirl a little more than than but not much if you want to maintain the marbleized look when you cut the bread. Top with the two banana strips and sprinkle the top with about another 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of Tajin (I had a spill and ended up with a bit more on the bananas than planned and it was delicious), Bake 50-60 minutes, until a tester or toothpick inserted into the center comes out batter-free. Cool in pan for 10 minutes, then gently run a knife around the edge and invert the banana bread onto a cooling rack., Serve warm or at room temperature.","[, (, ', b, a, n, a, n, a, s, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, 1, 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, 4, 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', b, a, k, i, n, g,  , s, o, d, a, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, 3, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', t, a, j, i, n, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', a, n, c, h, o,  , c, h, i, l, i,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, i, n, n, a, m, o, n, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, o, c, o, a,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ]"

Cover the jar and keep it at a warm temperature for 5 hours., Autolyse, (1:00 p.m)In a mixing bowl, add the Autolyse ingredients until no dry bits remain. Cover the bowl and let rest for 1-hour., Mix, (2:00 p.m.)Add the salt and levain to the top of the dough in autolyse and use a splash of the remaining water to moisten. With wet hands, mix thoroughly. Add the remaining water if the dough feels like it can handle it. Knead the dough for a few minutes using either the slap and fold technique or folds in the bowl until the dough smooths and becomes elastic. Transfer the dough back into the bowl. Transfer the dough to a bulk fermentation container and cover., Warm Bulk Fermentation, (2:15 p.m. to 4:45 p.m.)This dough will require 2 sets of stretches and folds during bulk fermentation at 30-minute intervals. After the second set, let the dough rest, covered, for the remainder of bulk fermentation., Cold Bulk Fermentation, (4:45 p.m. to 9:00 a.m.)After the warm bulk fermentation, place the covered bulk fermentation container in the refrigerator overnight., Divide and Preshape, (9:00 a.m., the next day)Gently scrape the dough from the bulk container to an un-floured work surface. Divide into 325g pieces and preshape the pieces of dough into rounds (my preference) or rough tubes. Because the dough is cold and firm, very little bench flour is needed to pre-shape. Let the preshaped dough rest for 35 minutes, uncovered., Shape, (9:50 a.m.)Prepare a couche and dust it with flour. Shape each piece of dough into a baguette shape., Proof, (10:15 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.)Proof the pieces until they pass the poke test, about 45 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature., Bake, (10:45 a.m.)Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C) for an hour with baking stone/steel inside. Divide the bake into two sessions if you only have one baking surface. Bake three baguettes first, and chill the rest in the fridge for the second session. Prepare a pizza peel with parchment paper matching the width of your baking surface. Grab and end of the couche and pull it out, moving the piece of dough away from the rest. Then, using a dough transfer board (a smaller pizza peel or a small cutting board could also work), place the board to the inside of the baguette (the side closest to the rest of the dough pieces). With the hand holding the couche, quickly flip the dough onto the peel by tugging up and slightly over the transfer board. The baguette should now be seam-side down on the transfer board. Repeat until you have three pieces on the peel. Score each baguette with three overlapping slashes. Transfer the dough onto the baking surface in the oven using the parchment paper. Next, steam the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the steaming pans and bake for another 20-25 minutes until done. Cool on a rack. Repeat the process for the remaining baguettes in the fridge.","[, (, ', w, h, i, t, e,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 7, 4, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 7, 4, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', r, i, p, e,  , s, o, u, r, d, o, u, g, h,  , s, t, a, r, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 3, 7, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, h, i, t, e,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, 0, 6, 8, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 6, 6, 8, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 5, 7, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, i, n, e,  , s, e, a,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', r, i, p, e,  , l, e, v, a, i, n, ', ,,  , 1, 8, 6, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ]"

95ba6f24,https://lechefswife.com/baking-baguettes-for-beginners/,French Baguette Recipe,"8 grams traditional yeast ( or 2 teaspoons), 1 tablespoon honey (natural honey worked better than the squeezable one), 1 1/4 cups warm water (not too hot - you don’t want to cook the yeast, just wake it up), 1 tablespoon fleur de sel ( if you are using table salt, use only a teaspoon), 2 1/2 cups bread flour (I used all purpose flour which also worked fine), 2 tablespoons olive oil","Proof the yeast with the honey and warm water. For bread making novices this means putting the warm water in your big mixing bowl and adding the yeast and honey. Give it a little stir and then let it sit on the counter for 10 minutes. You will see the grains of yeast wake up and rise to the surface and expand (this is a cool process to share with kids!), Once proofed, add salt and slowly add the flour and olive oil until a shaggy dough is formed. I started using a spatula and then dug in with my hands to work in all the flour. Form a round ball in the bowl but be careful not to work the dough too much. No need to use the Kitchen Aid for this recipe!, Dust the top of your dough ball with little bit of flour then cover with a towel. My Nanny’s trick was to wet a thin tea towel with hot water to cover the dough with and then place the bowl on top of the fridge for a little extra heat from the motor. I don’t have room on top of my fridge but placing the bowl on top of my dryer worked wonders. Let the dough rise until it doubles in size (about an hour) then split dough in 2 and roll out your baguettes., Rolling out a Baguette This is where it gets a little technical and where I struggled in my first attempt. Don't expect to make a perfect baguette on your first try. Rolling out dough takes some skill. Sprinkle flour over your countertop. Take the first ball of dough and gently knead it with the palm of your hand, until the dough gains a firmer consistency. Fold the dough over itself. Add a little more flour if necessary. (this is necessary if you are baking in a place with high humidity- don't be afraid to add more dough if the consistency is sticky) Flatten the dough into a rectangle form with your hands (you don't need a rolling pin). Then fold the top of the rectangle down like the top of an envelop, about 3/4 of the way down. Using your fingers, press down on the seam. Roll the folded top of the dough down so that you have a mini oblong rectangle. Press the seams and the flip the seam side down. Spread your fingers on both hands and gently roll the dough down to create a baguette shape. Roll back and forth to elongate the baguette dough until it is about 12 inches long. Set the first baguette on your cookie sheet or baguette pan. Roll out the second baguette. If you have a razor blade you can make incisions on the top of the baguette. A sharp knife also works using just the tip to make deft cuts into the baguette. For beginners I suggest using a pair of kitchen scissors to score the baguettes as show below. See video in the blog post for how Le Chef rolled out our baguettes and then cut (or scored) them beautifully to create tearable pieces to the baguette., Place the baguettes on a cookie sheet sprinkled with flour and then sprinkle a little more flour on top. Sprinkle a little fleur de sel. Let baguettes rise for another 30 minutes (uncovered) while oven preheats., Heat oven to 460 degrees. Once the oven is hot, fill a 9 inch pan halfway with water and place on the bottom rack of the oven. This creates steam and and is the key factor to that crackly crust we love ., Bake for 25 minutes **(oven temperatures vary greatly! Please keep a close eye after 18 minutes - if they look dark golden brown and sound hollow when you tap them, they are done!). Remove the pan of water (very carefully!) and bake another 5 minutes or so. The baguettes should be beautifully golden brown and sound hollow when tapped.","[, (, ', t, r, a, d, i, t, i, o, n, a, l,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 8, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, o, n, e, y, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, e, u, r,  , d, e,  , s, e, l, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ]"

Cover it with a plastic wrap and let it sit for 12-20 hours on the countertop., Flour, The following day, the dough should be wet, sticky and bubbly. Generously flour your hands and the baking sheet., Form Baguette, Take the dough (if it sticks, apply more flour to your hands) and form a baguette shape. You will easily get atleast 2-3 baguettes. For tips on shaping the dough, watch this tutorial. Place it on a baking sheet and sprinkle a generous amount of flour on it. Score the top with a sharp knife and cover it with a towel. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours., Preheat & Bake, Preheat the oven to 450 °F. You will need to have 2 shelves in an oven.

Add water and mix until combined roughly. Dump contents onto table or cutting board and knead for 2-3 minutes until well mixed/combined., Cover dough ball with lid or plastic wrap and bulk ferment for 12 hours at room temperature.  Then place the container and continue fermenting in the refrigerator for 12 hours., Divide risen dough into 3-4 portions. This is where the folding of dough comes into play., Perform what we call the ""envelop fold"", folding all 4 sides into the center of the dough. Do this 3 times, 30 minutes in between each set of folding. Let rest on a linen towel or something similar., The 4th time will be a more overlapping fold with a strong ""pinch"" to gas out and create a seal/seam the length of the dough. Let rest for another 30 minutes., With the palms of your hands, starting at the center of your dough, roll fairly aggressively out, pinching the ends to close them up. Do this 3-4 times until the baguette is long and thin, about 14""-16"". Let rest for 1-1.5 hours, seam side up. At this point, turn your oven on at 500 degrees with your Baking Steel on the top or second from top rack. , 15 minutes before you are going to bake, place a cake tin or sauté pan in the oven and load it up with a good cup or two of ice cubes, creating some steam. , Gently turn the baguettes over to seam side down, lame the top of your baguettes with a razor blade or sharp knife. Open the oven and quickly launch the baguettes on top of Baking Steel. Bake for 15 minutes without opening the oven. (Turn your oven light on if you want to peek!), Open the oven to let some steam escape. Continue the cook for another 5-7 minutes.

1220851e,https://www.melskitchencafe.com/french-bread/,Easy Homemade French Bread,"2 1/4 cups warm water, 110-115 degrees F, 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon instant or active dry yeast (see note), 2 1/4 teaspoons salt (see note), 2 tablespoons olive oil, canola oil, vegetable oil or avocado oil, 5 1/2 - 6 cups all-purpose flour or bread flour (see note)","In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the water sugar and yeast. If using active dry yeast, let the mixture bubble and foam before proceeding (this can take 3-5 minutes). If using instant yeast, proceed with the recipe (no need to let the yeast activate)., Add the salt, oil and 3 cups of flour and mix. Add in 2 1/2 to 3 more cups of flour gradually. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl and form a soft ball that doesn't leave a lot of dough residue on your fingers., Knead for 2-3 minutes until the dough is smooth. If the dough starts to cling to the sides of the bowl (or the center column if using a Bosch or other mixer with a center), add 1/4 cup of flour at a time until a sturdy but soft ball of dough forms., Rising Method 1: Leave the dough in the mixer, cover with a lid or towel, and let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Stir it down by turning on the mixer for 10 seconds or so. Repeat the ""rest and stir down"" cycle five more times., Rising Method 2: Instead of letting the dough rest for 10 minute spurts and then stirring it down, transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl and cover with a towel or greased plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until doubled, about an hour or so, depending on the warmth of your kitchen., Turn the dough onto a lightly greased surface and divide in half. Pat each section into a thick rectangle, 9X13-inches or thereabouts (doesn't have to be exact). Roll the dough up starting from the long edge, pressing out any air bubbles or seams with the heel of your hand, and pinch the edge to seal. Arrange seam side down on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper (I use separate baking sheets for each loaf)., With a bread lame, razor blade or VERY sharp knife, cut several gashes at an angle on the top each loaf (you can wait to score the bread until after it rises, but it can easily deflate if the razor/knife isn't sharp enough)., Cover the loaves with greased plastic wrap or a kitchen towel, and let rise until noticeably puffy and nearly doubled in size, about an hour., Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and make sure an oven rack is in the center position. If you find your bread isn't browning as much as you like, preheat the oven to 400 or 425 degrees and/or move the oven rack up one position (watch carefully so the bread, especially the bottom, doesn't burn)., Optional: for an extra golden, crisp crust, place the loaves in the preheated oven and immediately toss 3-4 ice cubes on the bottom of the oven. Close the oven door quickly but gently. (See note below!), Bake the loaves for 25-30 minutes until golden and baked through., If desired, brush melted butter over the hot loaves (this softens the crust a bit, so if you want a crispier crust, don't butter the top).","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, i, l, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 5, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ]"
2c3177c4,https://theloopywhisk.com/2023/05/04/gluten-free-baguettes/,The Best Gluten Free Baguettes,"25 g (5 tbsp) whole/rough psyllium husk ((If using psyllium husk powder, use only 21g.)), 480 g (2 cups) lukewarm water, 180 g (1½ cups + 1 tbsp) tapioca starch, 180 g (1⅓ cups) millet flour, plus extra for flouring the surface, 60 g (⅓ cup + 2 tbsp) sorghum flour, 25 g (2 tbsp) caster/superfine or granulated sugar, 10 g (2 tsp) salt, 6 g (2 tsp) instant yeast ((If using active dry yeast, use 8g.)), 20 g (1½ tbsp) olive oil, 10 g (2 tsp) apple cider vinegar","Making the dough:, You can prepare the dough using a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment or by hand., Make the psyllium gel: In a bowl, mix together the psyllium husk and warm water. After about 30-45 seconds, a gel will form., In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer (if using), whisk together the tapioca starch, millet flour, sorghum flour, sugar, salt and instant yeast.Tip: If using active dry yeast instead, you need to activate it first. Mix it together with 120g (½ cup) of the water and half of the sugar listed in the recipe. Set aside for 5-10 minutes, or until the mixture starts frothing. Then, add it to the dry ingredients along with the psyllium gel, olive oil and vinegar., Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and add the psyllium gel, olive oil and vinegar., Knead the dough until it's smooth and all the ingredients are evenly incorporated. Use a rubber spatula to occasionally scrape along the sides and bottom of the bowl to prevent any dry patches of unmixed flour.The final dough should come away from the sides of the bowl. It will be fairly soft but it shouldn’t be too sticky to the touch (note that this refers to when you gently touch it with clean hands – it will stick to your hands as you’re kneading it). Resist the temptation to add more flour to the dough, as that can make your baguettes dense and dry., Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and divide into three equal portions, each should weigh about 330g., Give each portion of dough a gentle knead to ensure that they're perfectly smooth. Tip: While you're working with one piece of dough, keep the other two covered with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap/cling film to prevent them from drying out., Shaping the baguettes:, When you shape the baguettes, work on a lightly floured surface (you really want just a sprinkling of flour on your work surface). See the blog post for detailed step-by-step photos of the shaping process., Take a piece of dough and pat it down into a rough rectangle, about ½-¾ inch (1.5-2cm) thick. I usually pat it down to a size of about 6x4½ inches (15x12cm) but don’t worry about the exact dimensions, they’re not really important., Working along the wider end, fold the dough over itself and press down gently to seal. Continue folding the dough over itself (and pressing down to seal) so that you’re essentially rolling it up into a log., Pinch the seam together to seal it. Don’t worry if your dough isn’t perfectly smooth at this point, it will smooth out even further when roll it into the typical baguette shape in the next step., Use the palms of your hands to roll the dough back and forth until you reach the desired length – aim for a length of about 13-15 inches (33-38cm). While you’re rolling it, make sure that you also create the tapered shape: you want the baguette to be thicker in the middle and gradually taper to the ends. You can shape your baguettes with rounded or sharp, pointy ends, whichever option you like best., Repeat with the other two portions of dough., Proofing the baguettes:, Lightly flour the baguettes on all sides to ensure that they don't stick to the proofing couche or kitchen towel that you'll use to proof them., Place the baguettes, seam-side up, into the folds of a floured baguette proofing couche or large kitchen towel. Cover them lightly with plastic wrap/cling film to prevent them from drying out.Tip: Proofing the baguettes between the folds of a proofing couche or kitchen towel helps to maintain their shape and prevents them from spreading out as they’re proofing., Proof the baguettes in a warm spot for about 45 minutes to 1 hour or until they’ve doubled in size., Oven setup & pre-heating the oven:, Place a baking steel or a large baking sheet, turned upside-down, on the middle oven rack and a baking tray (not glass!) on the lower oven rack.Tip 1: If you don't have a baking steel, make sure to use a sturdy, heavy duty baking sheet that's good at holding onto heat.Tip 2: Because you'll add ice cubes to the hot baking tray on the bottom of your oven to generate steam, it will experience quite a huge temperature change. So, don't use a glass baking tray/pan as it could shatter. I recommend cast iron, but a metal baking tray also works great., Preheat your oven for at least 45 minutes at 480ºF (250ºC). You want your oven, baking steel (or baking sheet) and baking tray thoroughly preheated before you put in the baguettes – this ensures maximum oven spring and therefore the prettiest (and most delicious) baguettes.In practice, I usually turn on the oven as soon as I’ve arranged the baguettes in the couche/kitchen towel and let them to proof., Scoring the baguettes:, Place a large sheet of parchment/baking paper on top of either a large pizza peel or a large baking sheet with no rimmed edges (you'll use this to slide the baguettes along with the parchment/baking paper onto the hot baking steel/baking sheet)., Once your baguettes have doubled in size, transfer them to the parchment/baking paper. Place them seam-side down and space them out as much as possible, so that they’ll have plenty of space around them during baking.To transfer the baguettes from the couche or kitchen towel, you can use a baguette transfer board (transfer peel) or simply pick them up VERY GENTLY with your hands – be careful not to deflate them., Use a bread lame or a sharp knife (held at about a 45º angle) to score each baguette with 3-4 lengthways slashes., Baking the baguettes:, Slide the baguettes, along with the parchment/baking paper, onto the hot baking steel or baking sheet. Place 4-5 ice cubes into the bottom baking tray and immediately close the oven door., Bake the baguettes at 480ºF (250ºC) with steam for 10 minutes. Don’t open the oven door during that time., After the 10 minutes, open the oven door to let out the steam and remove the bottom baking tray. Close the oven, reduce the oven temperature to 425ºF (220ºC) and bake for 15-20 minutes longer or until the baguettes are deep golden-brown., Remove them from the oven and cool on a wire rack until they’re *at least* lukewarm before you cut into them. Tip: I know that it’s super tempting to eat them while they’re still hot, but the crumb needs time to cool down and fully set. If you cut them while they’re still hot or too warm, you’ll find the crumb quite sticky., Storage:, These gluten free baguettes are at their very best on the day of baking. However, they keep really well for up to 3 days in a bread box, paper bag or wrapped in a clean kitchen towel.

Keep pushing it over so that the dough is rolled into a tube., Dust the paper with more flour if needed, then cut the tube into 2 shorter pieces.Place the pieces apart on the paper.Cover, then leave for 30 minutes or until the depression left by a finger pressed into the dough slowly rather than quickly springs back. If it springs back immediately then leave to prove for longer., While the dough is provingPreheat your oven to 240C / 220 Fan / Gas 9.Position a shelf just above the middle of the oven and place the large baking tray on it.

Place the flour in the bowl, then add the salt to one side of the bowl, and the yeast to the other., Mix on a slow speed, and slowly add the oil and the water. You might need to use a spatula to get the ingredients mixing if they are just stuck on the sides of your bowl. After five minutes of mixing, turn the speed up to medium and mix for another 5 - 10 minutes. You should have a glossy elastic dough that forms a ball around the hook and stretches when you pull it (see picture method for details)., Lightly oil a large bowl and tip the dough in, using a spatula to get all the dough out. Cover the bowl with cling film and leave to rise for 2 hours, until the dough has doubled in size., Scatter a clean surface with flour. Tip the risen dough onto the surface, and knock the air out by pressing the heels of your hands into it. Divide the dough into 2 pieces., Stretch each piece of dough into a long oblong shape, then roll with your fingers to even out the shape., Line a baking tray with baking paper and dust well with flour. Place the two baguettes onto the tray, and place the whole tray into a large plastic bag that is roomey enough not to touch the dough (a bin bag works well here, even if its not pretty looking - a clean one obviously!). Leave to rise again for 1 hour., Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C. Place another roasting tin on the bottom shelf., Remove the bread tray from the bag and dust the dough with a little more flour, or semolina if you have some. Create 3 diagonal slashes on the top of the dough using a very sharp knife, around 2cm deep., Just before putting the bread in the oven, pour 1 litre of water into the roasting tin at the bottom of the oven. This will create the steam that forms the classic baguette crust. Put the loaves in the oven on the middle shelf, and bake for 25 minutes, then lower the temperature to 160°C and bake for another 10 minutes. The baguettes should be a nice golden brown colour., Remove from the oven, and place on a wire rack to cool completely.","[, (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 2, 5, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, a, s, t, -, a, c, t, i, o, n,  , d, r, i, e, d,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, 8, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', m, l, ', ), ]"

Let the mixture sit for about 10 minutes to allow the yeast to bloom, or grow and become bubbly. Whisk in the salt., Gradually begin to add the flour 1 cup (125 g) at a time on low speed. Increase the speed as the dough begins to come together, kneading on medium-high speed for 6 to 8 minutes. It is ready when the dough no longer clings to the sides of the bowl and is smooth, elastic, and a little bit sticky. This dough in particular is very pillowy and soft., Knead the dough on the countertop into a ball, pulling it toward you on the counter while simultaneously tucking the bottom of the dough underneath itself. Place the dough into a large, lightly-greased bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel. Let the dough rest for about 15 minutes., After the resting period, gently deflate the dough by pressing down on it. Stretch and pull the dough by lifting up a corner of it, pulling away from the dough, and folding it over the top of the dough ball. Repeat this all around the circle of dough and tuck the ends underneath, forming a new ball. Cover the bowl back up and let the dough rise until doubled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours., Deflate the dough again. Bring it onto your countertop and divide the dough into two equal sized pieces. If necessary, lightly flour your countertop. Press the dough out on the counter with your fingertips into a 4 x 6–inch (10 x 15–cm) rectangle., To shape the baguette, fold half of the dough towards the center of the rectangle, like a business letter, and press it into the dough to seal. Fold the other half of the dough toward the center and press it in to seal., Taking the edge of the dough, roll it over the center seam you just created and press the loaf together, pinching and rolling along the entire length, of the little cylinder to enclose the loaf. Flip the loaf over with the seam, on the counter, dragging the loaf toward you to close the seam and create some tension on the loaf. Once the bread is firmly sealed, roll it out into a log about 16 inches (40 cm) long. Taper the very ends of the bread to create pointy tips. Repeat with the second loaf of bread., Transfer the shaped loaves to a couche or floured kitchen towel for the final proof. To create space for both loaves, pull up part of the fabric in between the two loaves; then cover the loaves with the remaining material or plastic wrap. Let the bread rise until nearly doubled, about 45 minutes. They are ready to bake when you make an indentation in the dough with your finger and it remains rather than popping back up., While the loaves proof for a second time, preheat the oven to 475°F (246°C). Place a shallow pan of water in the bottom of the oven to create steam. Line an 18 x 13–inch (46 x 33–cm) baking sheet with parchment paper., Once the loaves have puffed, it is time to shape them into wheat stalks. Carefully transfer the loaves to the prepared baking sheet. With a sharp pair of kitchen scissors, make a neat cut into the loaf crosswise, about, 2 inches (5 cm) from the tapered end. Lift and set the piece of cut dough, which looks a bit like a leaf, to one side of the loaf. Make a second cut another 2 inches (5 cm) above the previous cut, moving the dough over to the opposite side of the loaf. Repeat this process all up the length of the loaf, leaving the opposing tapered end straight. Shape the second loaf in a similar fashion., Bake the loaves in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the loaves are a deep golden brown and sound hollow when tapped upon with your fingertips or a spoon. Let the loaves rest for 15 to 20 minutes before pulling apart!, To store the bread, keep it at room temperature wrapped in plastic or a cloth bread bag for about 1 week.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 4, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ]"

Place it in the bottom of your oven. This will create steam during the bake, and lengthen the rise time in the oven. (If you have a steam oven, you can skip this step.), Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and place the mini baguette loaves on them. Lightly spritz the loaves with some water just to moisten the exterior., Then, using a sharp knife, cut slits on the top of the bread loaves to your liking. (I usually just do 3 at a slight diagonal.), Put the bread into an unheated oven with the tray of water at the bottom. Preheat the oven to 400*F with the bread inside., Bake for 25-35 minutes, until the loaves are firm on the exterior and the internal temperature reaches at least 190*F., Take the bread out, and place it on a cooling rack right away to cool.

You can make a little indent on top of the flour in order to avoid the yeast falling into the water (until the machine starts). Do not combine the salt with the yeast (as the salt can kill the yeast). Place the yeast & salt in separate parts of the bread pan., Place the bread pan back into the bread machine & then plug in the bread machine., Put your machine on the ""Dough"" setting and press the start button. In our bread machine, the kneading & rising on the dough setting takes about 1:30 hours., When your bread machine has finished, unplug the machine & pour the dough onto a cutting board. Wear oven mitts (as the bread pan/bread machine may be hot). Sprinkle some flour on the cutting board (before you pour the dough) in order to avoid the dough sticking to the cutting board., Divide the dough into 4 equal parts if you want to make 4 skinny baguettes (roughly 12 inches long). Or divide the dough into 2 equal parts in order to make 2 thicker french bread ""rolls"". FYI - I usually make 2 thicker & longer loaves with this recipe., Roll the divided dough with your hands into your preferred shape (i.e. baguette or thicker bread roll). See our tips below on shaping the bread dough (especially about making the dough roll about 1/2 the width of your desired end product... as the dough expands as the yeast rises)., Place the shaped dough onto a nonstick baking sheet., Coat the dough with olive oil. Use a small pastry brush., Cover the dough & baking sheet with a light kitchen cloth or plastic wrap in order to protect from dust, etc., Let the dough rise for 1 hour., During this ""rising"" time, preheat your oven to 450 degrees F., After the hour, remove the covering from the dough and ""score"" (slice) the top of each dough roll with a sharp knife. Make diagonal slices about 1/2 inch deep and about 3 inches apart. This will help prevent the bread from cracking during baking. See the tips below about how to score bread., Place the baking sheet in the oven. It should bake at 450 degrees for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Wear oven mitts., At the 8-10 minute mark, turn the baking sheet around in order to ensure an even ""browning"" of the bread. Wear oven mitts., Remove the baking sheet when done and place the bread on a cooling rack. Wear oven mitts.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , m, a, c, h, i, n, e,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ]"

When using a mixer, add flour a little bit at a time until the dough starts to pull off the sides of the bowl (see video for details). If mixing by hand, add enough flour where it is still tacky and start kneading. Once it's time to knead, knead in mixer for 9 minutes or by hand for about 15-20 minutes., Knead until dough is soft and TACKY. Do not over add flour because it will be too dense (See video for details)., Once kneading is done, place in greased bowl (or keep in mixer bowl), cover and rise for about 30-45 minutes until doubled., Once doubled, dough probably will still be tacky. This is good. Lightly dust surface of counter and place dough on counter. Divide into three even dough balls (baguettes) or two even dough balls (French bread). If necessary, lightly dust your hands if too sticky or dip hands in water., With each dough ball, roll out into a rectangle about 10 inches wide and 6-7 inches deep. Don't overthink this, you just want a rectangle., Fold over 1/3 of dough into middle and press seam down. Roll over again to the edge and press seam., Roll dough into a long shape for a baguette or a longer, but shorter, shape for French bread (see video)., Place on baguette or French bread pans (or place on a dusted, clean tea towel with places pulled up to create an edge between each loaf)., Cover and let rise until double., While dough is rising, preheat oven to 425 degrees F, Once bread loaves have doubled (about 30 minutes), score and brush with water or mist with a clean spray bottle. Egg wash can also be used, but it will be more browned., Bake at 425 degrees F for 10 minutes.

Let the mixture sit for about eight minutes to allow the yeast time to active., Next, pull out your handy mixer and mix the 4 cups of flour and 2 teaspoons of salt with a dough hook. Slowly add in the yeast mixture., The dough should come together around the dough hook into a ball. If the dough is too dry add a little bit more warm water – a tablespoon at a time – if the dough is too wet add more flour – a tablespoon at a time., Take the dough off the hook and out of the mixer and place it on a well floured surface. Knead the dough for about 4 minutes and then do the thumbprint test., Place the ball of dough in a spray oiled bowl and cover with a dishcloth., Place the bowl in a warm area for 30 minutes – or until its double in size., Take your beautifully risen dough out of the bowl and place it onto your counter and mold into a ball., Divide the dough into 2-4 pieces – depending on how large of a cookie sheet you have to cook it on. I have a very large one, so I usually divide it into 3 pieces., Take one of the dough pieces and shape it into a flat rectangle on your counter, then fold the outer edges towards the center and pinch the seem together with your fingers., Continue to fold the outer edge toward the center and pinching the seems together, as you do this stretch the dough lengthwise so that it begins to get longer., Once your dough is about 12-14 inches long and 1½ – 2 inches wide, fold in the ends to form the rounded ends of the dough., Continue this process until all of the dough pieces are shaped into baguettes., Place the baguettes seem side down onto the cookie sheet that is lined with foil, sprayed with oil, and sprinkled with cornmeal., Take a knife and make diagonal slits across each loaf that are about ½ inch deep., Cover the loaves with a dishcloth and set in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes., Carefully remove the risen loaves from the oven and turn the oven to 450°. Also, place a second cookie sheet in the oven – one with edges – on the bottom rack. While you are waiting for the oven to heat up, fill a small to medium sized bowl with ice., Once the oven is heated up, place the baguette loaves on the middle rack, pour the ice onto the heated cookie sheet, and quickly close the door to keep the steam from escaping – this will help create a nice crust., Bake for 10-15 minutes until golden brown., Let cool and enjoy!","[, (, ', h, o, n, e, y, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 4, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ]"

Add the salt, and whisk again to combine., Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the water, egg white, honey, vinegar, and butter, and mix to combine., Beat the mixture with the paddle attachment with the stand mixer on medium speed for about a minute. The dough will clump., Increase the speed to medium-high and continue to beat until the dough begins to stick to the sides of the mixing bowl and looks “whipped” in texture. Transfer the dough to a container with a lid that seals tightly, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 days., When you’re ready to shape the dough, turn the chilled dough out onto a flat surface lightly sprinkled with tapioca starch. Dust the top of the dough lightly with more tapioca starch, and turn it over a few times and knead it gently to smooth the dough., Using a large knife or bench scraper, divide the dough into 2 equal portions., Working with one piece of dough at a time, dusting very lightly with more flour as necessary to prevent sticking, shape the bread into a cylinder, pinching together any breaks in the dough to seal them., Position the palms of both hands right next to one another on the top of the cylinder of dough. Roll the dough first away from your body and then back toward it as you move your hands in a half moon motion away from one another, toward the edges of the dough., The shape should be thicker in the center, tapered toward the ends. See the video for a visual of shaping the dough., Place the shaped rolls a couple inches apart on a parchment lined baking sheet. Cover with lightly greased plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft-free environment and allow to rise until risen to about 150% of its original size., Rising will take longer in a dry, cool environment, and less time in a warm, humid environment. Do not place it in a heated oven, to any temperature, to rise, or you risk killing the yeast., As the bread dough is nearing the end of its rise, preheat your oven to 475°F and position the top rack a bit higher than the center of the oven. When the rise is complete, uncover the baking sheet., Using a small, sharp knife or a lame held at a 45° angle to the dough, slash each roll on top 3 times at evenly spaced spots on the dough about 1/4-inch deep. Spray the tops and sides of each roll liberally with cooking oil spray., Place the baking sheet on the top oven rack, toss a few ice cubes on the floor of the oven, and quickly close the oven door., Bake for 18 minutes, and rotate the baking sheet one half turn. Continue to bake for about another 5 minutes or until lightly golden brown all over and an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roll read about 190°F., For a softer crust, wrap the hot rolls in a tea towel as they cool. Allow to cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.","[, (, ', a, l, l,  , p, u, r, p, o, s, e,  , g, l, u, t, e, n,  , f, r, e, e,  , f, l, o, u, r,  , b, l, e, n, d, ', ,,  , 1, ., 7, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', x, a, n, t, h, a, n,  , g, u, m, ', ,,  , 0, ., 7, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', t, a, p, i, o, c, a,  , s, t, a, r, c, h, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', i, n, s, t, a, n, t,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', k, o, s, h, e, r,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, r, m,  , w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 7, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g,  , w, h, i, t, e, ', ,,  , 1, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', h, o, n, e, y, ', ,,  , 1, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', a, p, p, l, e,  , c, i, d, e, r,  , v, i, n, e, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', u, n, s, a, l, t, e, d,  , b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ]"

Stir in flour, mixing until there are no dry patches. Dough will be quite loose. Cover lightly with a kitchen towel but don't seal the bowl airtight. Let the dough rise at room temperature 2 hours (or up to 5 hours)., Bake at this point or refrigerate, covered in an airtight container, for as long as two weeks. When ready to bake, cut off a grapefruit-size piece with serrated knife (I have only ever made two loaves out of the batch of dough so I just divide the dough in half to form my first loaf). Turn the dough in your hands to lightly stretch the surface, creating a rounded top and a lumpy bottom. Put the dough on a piece of parchment paper set on a pizza peel or a rimmed baking sheet turned upside down., Slashing: you can dust the top of the dough lightly with flour and slash now (before rising) or wait until after the loaf has risen. I've found waiting and slashing the dough after rising can sometimes cause the loaf to collapse, so after making this bread for years, my preferred method is to dust the top of the loaf lightly with flour at this step, before rising, and slash the top with a baker's lame or sharp knife 3-4 times., Let the dough rest for 40 minutes for room temperature dough; if you have used the dough out of the refrigerator, let it rest for 1 1/2 hours. Repeat with remaining dough or refrigerate it., Place a broiler pan on the bottom rack of the oven (if you don't have a broiler pan - no worries! Tossing 5-6 ice cubes in the bottom of the oven when you put in the bread works really well, too). Place a baking stone on the middle rack and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Heat the stone at that temperature for 20 minutes before baking., After the dough has rested and is ready to bake, if you haven't already (see step #3), dust the dough lightly with flour, slash the top with serrated or very sharp knife three times., Slide the dough (with the parchment paper) onto the baking stone. Pour one cup of hot water into the broiler pan (or toss 5-6 ice cubes in the bottom of the oven) and shut the oven quickly but gently to trap the steam.

Pour in the water and gently mix together with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon. The dough will seem dry and shaggy, but keep working it until all the flour is moistened. If needed, use your hands (as I do in the video tutorial below) to work the dough ingredients together. The dough will be sticky. Shape into a ball in the bowl as best you can., Keeping the dough in the bowl, cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and set on the counter at room temperature (honestly any normal room temperature is fine!). Allow to rise for 2-3 hours. The dough will just about double in size, stick to the sides of the bowl, and have a lot of air bubbles., You can continue with step 4 immediately, but for absolute best flavor and texture, I strongly recommend letting this risen dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours and up to 3 days. Place covered dough in the refrigerator for 12 hours – 3 days. I usually let it rest in the refrigerator for about 18 hours. The dough will puff up during this time, but may begin to deflate after 2 days. That’s fine and normal—nothing to worry about., Lightly dust a large nonstick baking sheet (with or without rims and make sure it’s nonstick) with flour and/or cornmeal. Turn the cold dough out onto a floured work surface. Using a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut dough in half. Some air bubbles will deflate as you work with it. Place dough halves on prepared baking sheet. Using floured hands, shape into 2 long loaves about 9×3 inches each (doesn’t have to be exact) about 3 inches apart. Loosely cover and allow to rest for 45 minutes. You will bake the dough on this prepared baking sheet., During this 45 minutes, preheat the oven to 475°F (246°C)., When ready to bake, using a very sharp knife or bread lame (some even use kitchen shears), score the bread loaves with 3 slashes, about 1/2 inch deep. (“Score” = shallow cut.) If the shaped loaves flattened out during the 45 minutes, use floured hands to narrow them out along the sides again., Optional for a slightly crispier crust: After the oven is preheated and bread is scored, place a shallow metal or cast iron baking pan or skillet (I usually use a metal 9×13-inch baking pan) on the bottom oven rack. Carefully and quickly pour 3-4 cups of boiling water into it. Place the scored dough/baking pan on a higher rack and quickly shut the oven, trapping the steam inside. The steam helps create a crispier crust., Place the shaped and scored dough (on the flour/cornmeal dusted pan) in the preheated oven on the center rack. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Gently tap the loaves—if they sound hollow, the bread is done. For a more accurate test of doneness, the bread is done when an instant read thermometer inserted in the center reads 195°F (90°C)., Remove the bread from the oven and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Store leftovers loosely covered at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.","[, (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 4, 3, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', i, n, s, t, a, n, t,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 6, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, o, a, r, s, e,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 9, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 3, 6, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', m, l, ', ), ]"

Let that sit for a few mins. Add the sugar in and let sit for another min. or two., Add flour & salt to the large mixing bowl & stir all the ingredients together., The bread should be just a little sticky but not too much, if it's really sticky & wet add a little extra flour, if the dough is super dry then add a little more water (sometimes I have to add a little extra water to mine)., Cover the bowl but not airtight (I placed a clean kitchen towel over the top of the bowl) & let it rise for 2 hours., After 2 hours place the dough onto a well floured surface. If you want to make 2 smaller sized loafs of bread then divide the dough in half., Shape the dough by picking it up & using your hands to fold the edge of the dough under until you have a loaf shape with smooth edges.

DO NOT PUNCH THE DOUGH DOWN - you want to keep all those nice air bubbles intact so you have an airy, delicious loaf of bread. (Note: If the dough is sticking to the bowl a little bit, wet your hand with a bit of cold water and gently separate the dough from the bowl to get it all out)., Shape the dough into a round loaf: Pull each corner of the dough in towards the center (like you're folding an envelope) and repeat until the dough feels tight and begins to resist your folds.

Whisk thoroughly until combined, with a fork. Add flours, and mix together first with the fork to start to incorporate, then with your hands until a shaggy dough is formed, and the bits of flour left just disappear. Sprinkle the salt on top and do not mix in, just leave it on top. Cover with a damp cloth., Autolyse: let dough sit for one hour, covered and undisturbed., Bulk ferment: Now you will knead the salt that is sitting on top, into the dough for about 2 1/2 minutes. There is no precise way to do this, just think of working the dough through your hands and up against the bowl, push and pull. You will start to feel the dough relax a bit around 1 minute. Then leave the dough alone, covered, for 30 minutes. This counts as your first set of stretch and folds., After those 30 minutes pass, perform a set of stretch and folds. Repeat 2 more times., Now you will let sit, undisturbed and covered with a damp cloth, for the remainder of its bulk fermentation. You will know it is finished with its bulk ferment when the dough has risen about 75% (just short of doubling) in size, is smooth and puffy on top, with a few bubbles around the edges. It will not be as jiggly as some sourdough you've made before. I find this takes between 5-7 hours, depending on the temperature of your home. If the temperature in your home is above 72 degrees, this will be on the lower end; if it is cooler it will take on the longer end. Always go by the look and feel of your dough to know when it is finished proofing rather than time., When finished with bulk fermentation, lightly dust your work surface with flour. Put dough onto the work surface, and pre-shape. Then let sit for 15 minutes on your work surface., Then shape your dough using the video attached here as a guide., Place dough into your flour dusted banneton, (or flour dusted linen lined banneton) seam side up. (Optional, you can wait 15 minutes after placing it in banneton, and pinch the perimeters of the dough into the center to hold the shape even more, called stitching.) The dough will now go through its final rise. You can do this on the counter, which will take about 1 1/2 to 2 hours at 70 degrees F for the dough to puff up and be jiggly. It will not double. OR you can do the final rise overnight in the refrigerator, with the banneton covered in a plastic bag or with a very damp cloth. You need this for holding moisture in., Time to bake. Preheat your oven to 475 degrees F, with your dutch oven preheating inside the oven. When the oven is preheated, flip your dough out gently onto parchment paper and score your dough. If you did the final rise in the refrigerator, take it straight from fridge to scoring. You should score it cold, and DO NOT need to let it come to room temp., Then put scored dough into the dutch oven on the parchment, and put cover on. Turn oven down to 450 degrees F and slide dutch oven in. Bake for 20 minutes, then remove cover., Turn heat down to 430 degrees F, and bake for 20 to 25 more minutes, until crust is golden brown and crackly.

Note: You may not need all of the water. Just make sure the dough is a tad bit moist. Add a little bit of flour at a time to get it to a less sticky consistency. Continue on with the steps 1-11 below., Technique 2, In a liquid measuring cup add 1/4 cup of lukewarm water, add the yeast and 2 teaspoons of granulated sugar. Check back in 10 minutes to make sure it has bubbled and foamed up. If it has then add lukewarm water up to the 2 cup mark of the measuring cup. Note: If it didn’t then you need to try another packet / jar of yeast., In a bowl blend the flour and salt, mix well. Next pour the water 1/2 cup at a time into the flour mix using your fork to blend. Continue to add as much of the water/yeast mixture that you need. Please note you may not need all of the water. You want the dough to be just a tad bit moist. Flour your hands and begin to form the round ball. Continue on with the steps 1-11 below., Continue with Steps 1-11 below, Next, sprinkle with a bit more flour and work it with your hands to make a ball. It’s not necessarily kneading per say. You are just rolling and tucking in gently to get a smooth ball, Take the dough and gently mold it into a smooth but firm ball with an elastic feel., Put the dough back into the bowl and cover with a kitchen towel and let it rise. This could take anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour. It all depends on the temperature in the house and the humidity. Since I am in Houston, Texas this takes me about 45 minutes., Once it rises take a little more flour, pat it down and roll it into a ball again., {OPTIONAL} Put the dough back into the bowl and let it rise 1 more time. When you let the bread rise twice it really makes for a better bread but if you are short on time then don’t worry about it., After you are done with all the rising, you will take the dough and put it on the parchment paper that is on a baking tray. The dough should be elongated and oval-shaped, with tapered and rounded (not pointed) ends., Take about 1 tablespoon of olive oil and coat the dough with it. This will make it nice and crunchy on the outside., After you rub it down with olive oil you can sprinkle a bit of sea salt or sesame seeds on top., Next, score the top of the dough with a sharp knife at a 45 degree angle. See image below in my post., Bake 30 minutes, until you hear a hollow sound when you tap the bottom., Allow the bread to cool slightly before serving, and enjoy!","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, e, s, a, m, e,  , s, e, e, d, s, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ]"

Sprinkle the yeast on top and allow it to proof for a few minutes as you measure the remaining ingredients. Add the flour and salt to the bowl and stir until it is fully incorporated., Cover the bowl with a lid, clean kitchen towel, or piece of plastic wrap. Set the bowl in the refrigerator and allow it to rest for 2-4 hours. A longer proof in the refrigerator leads to a better tasting loaf. Two hours should be sufficient if the water was warm to the touch and the yeast was allowed to proof before adding the dry ingredients. You will know that the dough is ready to shape when it has risen slightly and has visible bubbles on the surface., Brush the bottom surface and sides of your cast iron skillet with Baking Pan Release Spread or add a light coating of cooking spray or neutral tasting oil., Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Sprinkle flour on a clean work surface. Remove the dough to the floured surface. The dough will be very sticky at first. Knead and turn the dough, shaping it into a ball as you go. Turn the dough a quarter turn with each kneading motion. Add more flour if necessary. The dough will quickly take shape and begin to lose its sticky texture. I usually knead it about 30 turns., Place the ball of dough in the middle of the prepared skillet. You can use a sharp knife to score the top of the loaf if you wish. Scoring the loaf will create a beautiful pattern on the baked loaf, but it isn't necessary to bake a delicious and beautiful loaf. Allow the dough to rest for around 30 minutes, While the bread is resting, prepare your oven or grill for baking by preheating to 420-425 degrees Fahrenheit., When the 30 minutes have elapsed and your oven or grill is holding temperature, transfer the skillet to the preheated oven/grill. Set a timer for 30 minutes., Unlike an oven, grills can vary in heat during the cooking period. So, when I am baking these loaves on the grill, I usually check the temperature by glancing at our grill’s thermometer every ten minutes or so. If your grill runs a bit hotter than you would like, open the lid, adjust the heat down slightly, and consider baking your loaf for a few minutes less if necessary. It will all come out delicious in the end, I promise., When 30 minutes have passed, the loaf should be brown and the top surface should be crisp. Carefully remove the hot skillet from the oven or grill and transfer to a safe place to cool for 5-10 minutes., Transfer the loaf from the skillet to a serving board or platter. Serve and enjoy every last bite with plenty of butter!","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, o, n, e, y, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 7, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, h, e, a, t,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ]"

If you want to do this with your hands, oil the work surface and your hands with a little olive or vegetable oil, and knead for 10 minutes. It will be a sticky dough - this is fine., Once kneaded, place the dough in an oiled bowl (wiped with a little olive or vegetable oil). Cover with clingfilm or a wax wrap and prove for 1 hour - until doubled in size., Sprinkle the work surface with 1/4 cup (30g) flour and tip the dough out onto the flour. You'll probably need to use your hands to tease it out of the bowl, as it will still be quite sticky. Sprinkle with a tablespoon of the flour., We DON'T want to knock the air out of the dough at this point. We simply want to shape the dough by grabbing a piece from the outside and pulling it into the middle., Continue this, pulling the dough in all the way around until the dough no longer wants to stick in place (see the video for a visual on this). You may need a little more flour to prevent it sticking., Then turn the dough over and use your hands just to finish off rounding it out., Place the dough in a well-floured proving basket or floured bowl - SEAM-SIDE-DOWN., Cover with clingfilm or a wax wrap and prove for 30 minutes., Meanwhile, place a dutch oven (approx 25cm/10"" diameter) in the oven and preheat the oven to 230C/450F (fan)., When the dough has finished its second prove, remove the cover, take a long piece of parchment or greaseproof paper and place it on top of the bowl., Gently tip the bowl upside-down the dough ends up on the paper., Very carefully take the hot Dutch oven out of the oven and remove the lid (leave a tea towel on top of the lid, so you don't forget it's hot and grab the lid without thinking)., Use the edge of the baking parchment to carefully lower the bread into the Dutch oven.

Add water and mix together until incorporated and all the flour is mixed in. The dough will look and feel sticky and shaggy. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for a minimum of 5 hours and up to 24 hours., Shaping: After a long rest, the dough should be risen and have bubbles on top of the dough. Dust a clean surface with flour. Dust your hands with flour as well. Using your hands or a bowl scraper, scoop out your dough onto the floured work surface. View your ball of dough as having 4 corners. Using a bench scraper or your hands, pull in each corner to gather into a round ball, creating a seam on top. Turn it over so the seam is now on the table and with your hands, continue to gently reinforce the round shape, by cupping your hands around the dough, and turning it several times., Rest: Place the dough ball on a proofing basket seam side up, or on a piece of parchment paper seam side down and then transfer it to a bowl to rest. Both of these items help it rest and keep its shape, but if either of those are unavailable, you can just let it rest on a parchment lined baking sheet. Dust the top lightly with flour.Cover with plastic wrap or a light towel and let the dough rest for 45-60 minutes. Meanwhile, place your dutch oven in your oven and preheat to 450° F. If you don't have a dutch oven, you can cook on a baking sheet or baking stone, the exterior of the bread just may be less crusty., Baking: After its rested and risen slightly, place in your dutch oven. If you wish, you can keep the bread on the parchment paper and transfer it over that way. It also makes it easier to remove the bread when finished as well. You can score the bread into a design before putting into the oven but you don't have to.Bake with the lid on at 450° for 25 minutes. Then remove the lid and bake for an additional 8-12 minutes, or until it gets a nice golden finished color. The bread will sound hollow when you tap it. Let it cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting., Storing: This bread stores wonderfully. You can wrap it airtight and leave on the counter for a few days or you can wrap it up and store it in the freezer for a few months. Just let it thaw at room temperature, cover with foil, and let it reheat in the oven before serving for best results.

Cover with plastic wrap and a towel, set it and forget it for AT LEAST 12 hours., Next day: using a well-floured hand, pull the (very risen and bubbly!) dough from the bowl and onto a floured work surface. Keep flouring the dough as you fold it over itself a few times, forming a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let it sit about 20 minutes. Then fold it over itself another few times (like, three to five times) and reshape the ball. Lightly flour the top and cover with a towel for another two hours., In the meantime, preheat your oven to 450. Place a large, lidded dutch oven in the oven while it preheats. Transfer the ball of dough to the pot, place the lid on it and slide it in for 30 minutes.

Don't worry about mixing it too much, just make sure everything is uniformly wet. It WILL be messy and sticky. You can scrape what's left on the spoon with a silicone spatula. (photo below provided for what the texture should look like - if it seems too wet, add 1-2 tablespoons more flour at a time until it is more like the photo. If it seems too dry, do the same thing with more water)., Allow to rise in a warm place., Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or place the container to the lid on ajar). Leave it for 2-3 hours to rise in a somewhat warm place until it's doubled in volume, like photo in previous step (If it's cold out, I like to preheat my oven for a few minutes, then turn it off, then place the bowl in the oven, trapping the heat inside. If your house is warm just leave it out, or if it's warm outside you can place it there)., Bake or refrigerate., After the two-three hour rise time when the dough has about doubled, you have two options: bake, or store in the fridge. See notes for how to store., Preheat the Dutch oven., 30 minutes to an hour before you are ready to bake, preheat your oven to 450 degrees F. Place your Dutch oven in the oven, with the lid ON, while the oven is preheating. Once the oven reaches 450, keep it preheating for another 20 minutes, so the Dutch oven gets good and hot., Flour parchment paper and add dough., Scrape the dough into the edge of a piece of parchment paper dusted with flour. Make it into as much of a ""loaf"" shape as you can by folding the edges up on top of it (a silicone spatula works well for this)., Shape the loaf., Then, use the edges of the parchment paper to flip the loaf over so the floured side is on top and the loaf is in the center of the parchment paper. Don't worry about it looking beautiful or smooth on top. My Dutch oven is an oval, so I made an oval shape. You can do a circle if yours is round., Score the loaf., Optional: use a very sharp knife or clean razor blade to cut a few slits across the top of the loaf about 1/2"" deep, across the entire top. I did this in a cross shape for mine., Place loaf in hot Dutch oven carefully., Take out the preheated Dutch oven and take off the lid, carefully! Grab the parchment from the sides and place the loaf in your Dutch oven., Bake., Place the cover back on the Dutch oven and place in the preheated oven on the center rack. Bake for 35 minutes at 450 degrees F (40 minutes if dough was cold from the fridge). Remove the lid and bake for another 5-10 minutes, until a golden brown color forms- longer if necessary. Remove the loaf from the dutch oven (grabbing the sides of the parchment paper works well here) and place it on a wire rack or cutting board to cool for at least 10 minutes (preferably 30 minutes - an hour, if you have time) before slicing.","[, ', (, w, a, t, e, r, ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , c, u, p, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, y, e, a, s, t, ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , p, a, c, k, e, t, ), ', ,,  , ', (, s, a, l, t, ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ), ', ,,  , ', (, f, l, o, u, r, ,,  , 3, ., 2, 5, ,,  , c, u, p, s, ), ', ]"

You should get a scale.)","Combine salt with flour in a mixing bowl, then add water and mix either by hand or with a dough whisk until fully incorporated into a ""shaggy mass."", Add starter and mix / squish by hand until fully incorporated. The process of incorporating the starter is a bit of primary kneading and should result in the dough smoothing out some, but don't go nuts. As soon as the starter is fully incorporated, you're done., Cover mixing bowl and let sit., First Bulk Fermentation Period, The first (of three) bulk fermentation period is at room temperature which for me is 73 - 75 degrees F, and lasts about 10 hours., At about an hour in, do 5-10 minutes of hand kneading (see notes and video below) until the dough develops some strength and elasticity and becomes noticeably smoother. Cover and let sit., Every 1-2 hours (exact timing is not important - really!) do a short round of stretching and folding to re-develop the dough's elasticity (see notes and video below). Then re-cover and let sit., Second Bulk Fermentation Period, After about 10 hours, or whenever the dough has risen to about 1.5 times its original volume, put the covered bowl of dough into a cold (~40 F) refrigerator and let sit (for me, this is overnight) for about 10 hours., Third Bulk Fermentation Period, Remove dough from refrigerator and let sit at room temperature again., As the dough warms up, resume periodic stretch and folds. Dough should be feeling progressively more lively, developing a bit of sour aroma, and eventually starting to bubble some., This final bulk fermentation period is the hardest to put a time length on. Getting it right matters, and it will totally depend on how active your starter is, how warm your kitchen is, and a whole host of other mostly invisible things. You are shooting to finish this period when the dough has risen to 2 - 2.5 times its original volume and ideally is actively blowing a few bubbles. I've had this take anywhere from 4 - 8 hours depending on this and that. Your mileage may vary. Try not to overshoot this - you'll probably have a better result erring on the too soon side than the too late side., Shaping and Proofing, (See notes and video below), Prepare a lined proofing basket by generously flouring the inside and set it aside., Lightly flour a large work surface and turn the dough out onto it., Wet your hands, punch down the dough and then stretch and flatten it into a large thin rectangle., Fold dough in half from top to bottom and press top into bottom, flattening again but not as big as the initial rectangle. At this point, you want the height of the dough rectangle to be right about the length of your proofing basket (no more than that)., [Optional] Lightly flour the top of the dough (and your hands)., Start at one end and roll the dough rectangle into a cylinder., Keep track of the seam and transfer the dough cylinder into the lined, floured proofing basket seam-side up., Cover and let sit for 1 - 1.5 hours., Baking, From 30 - 60 minutes after transferring dough into proofing basket, pre-heat oven and clay baker to 450 degrees F ~ about 20 - 30 minutes., Uncover dough and transfer from proofing basket into base of clay baker, score top of dough, cover and bake at 450 F for 25 minutes., Uncover clay baker, reduce oven temperature to 400 F and bake uncovered for another 20-25 minutes (or until desired crust color develops)., Remove bread and place on cooling rack for at least a couple hours before cutting.","[, (, ', w, h, o, l, e,  , r, e, d,  , f, i, f, e,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 4, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, h, o, l, e,  , h, a, r, d,  , w, h, i, t, e,  , w, h, e, a, t,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 2, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 5, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, o, u, r, d, o, u, g, h,  , s, t, a, r, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 3, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ]"

Whisk this together and then zero out the scale again., Add in 500 grams of unbleached all-purpose flour. Mix this together using your hands or a dough whisk. It will feel a bit dry. Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel and let it rest for 30 minutes., After 30 minutes has passed, zero out the scale again and sprinkle on 13 grams of fine sea salt and 75 grams of filtered water. Use your hands to massage and combine the water and salt into the dough. It should be pretty sticky by the time it is all combined., Perform 4-6 series of stretch and folds every 15 minutes until the dough is firmer and holding its shape. Read the next steps on how to stretch and fold your dough., Wet your hands and grab the dough at..., Wet your hands and grab the dough at one edge of the bowl in both hands, pulling and stretching a thin piece of dough up and then folding it back over the dough to the opposite side where you first grabbed it., Turn the bowl 45 degrees and repeat the stretch and fold. Turn the bowl 45 degrees again, stretch and fold. One last time, turn the bowl, stretch and fold. So to recap you are doing four stretch and folds around the bowl for one series., Cover the dough with the kitchen towel and let it rest for 15 minutes. Repeat 3-5 more times till dough is more firm., Cover the dough with a damp kitchen towel to keep the moisture in and let the dough rest in a warm (not too hot) area until it has doubled in size. This may take between 8-12 hours depending on the temperature of your home and the strength of your sourdough starter., Once it has doubled in size, you can shape the dough., Keep a small bowl of water nearby. You will need to wet your hands slightly to work with the dough., Scoop your dough out onto a clean surface. It does not need to be floured to work with the dough since your hands are slightly wet. *note: if you have doubled the recipe, this is when you will divide the dough into two equal pieces using a bench scraper or sharp knife. Follow the remaining instructions for both pieces of dough., Stretch the dough out onto your clean work surface into a thin stretched out rectangle. Tri-fold the dough over on itself like you would a hand towel, so that it forms a long thin rectangle., Fold the dough onto itself lengthwise of the rectangle creating a dough ball., Begin to roll your dough into a tighter ball by pushing with the heel of your dominant hand along the work surface and then pulling it back towards you with the fingers of your dominant hand. Repeat the push pull motion for a minute or two until the dough ball is holding its shape., You may need to repeat the folding and push-pull after letting the dough rest for a few minutes if it seems like it is not holding the shape well., After you have shaped the dough, place it in a banneton bread proofing basket. Line the basket with linen dusted with flour for a smooth finish, or just the banneton basket dusted with flour to get those pretty rings on the dough., Cover the dough with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours. When the dough is in the fridge, this slows down the rise of the dough and adds flavor. It will also give the dough that nice crispy crust when you bake it later. You can bake after 6 hours or up to 48 hours of being in the fridge., Place your dutch oven, lid and all, into your oven and set to 450℉. When the oven is close to temperature, take your dough out of the refrigerator., Flip the dough out onto a piece of parchment paper that is twice the size of your bread dough. Sprinkle a little bit of flour on the dough and smooth out with your hands., Using a bread lame or sharp razor, score your bread., Pull the dutch oven out of your oven when it has come to temperature. Take the lid off and place your parchment paper lined dough into dutch oven. Grab the corners of the parchment paper together to hold it and lower it into the dutch oven. Place the lid back on and carefully place it into the oven., Bake for 20 minutes with the lid on., Once 20 minutes is up, pull the rack out and remove the lid. Push the dutch oven back in and bake for another 20 minutes., Pull your beautiful rustic sourdough loaf out of the dutch oven. Place it on a cooling rack so the dutch oven doesn't continue to bake the bottom of the loaf. I do this by grabbing the corners of the parchment paper I used to lower it into the dutch oven., Allow it to cool for 30 minutes before cutting into it to finish the baking process.

Mix together. Cover and let sit at warm room temperature (78-80ºF) for about 3-4 hours until the mixture is bubbly, doubled in size and just about to fall. Once the levain has doubled in size and has reached it's peak height, it is ready to use., No-Knead Beginner Sourdough, Mix Dough: Mix 230 grams of ripe levain, room temperature water, flour and salt in a bowl using a wooden spoon or dough whisk (affiliate link). The dough will look “shaggy” (rough, craggy and a little bit lumpy) at first but mix until it forms a ball. Cover the bowl and let rest for 1 hour at 78-80ºF., Stretch & Fold #1: After an hour, uncover the bowl and do a series of three ""stretch and folds"". To do this, pick up the underside of the dough and fold it on top of itself, turning the bowl after each fold and picking up a different section of the dough to fold and turn. An example of this folding technique is found here (halfway through the video). Cover the bowl again and let it rest for another hour, keeping the dough at 78-80ºF., Stretch & Fold #2: After an hour, uncover the bowl and repeat the series of three stretch and folds. Notice how the dough is coming together. It doesn’t feel shaggy anymore and is becoming more stretchy and cohesive. Cover the bowl again and let rest at a warm temperature 78-80ºF for one hour., Stretch & Fold #3: Uncover the bowl and repeat the series of three stretch and folds. This is your final set of stretch and folds. Cover the dough and let rest for another hour, keeping the dough warm 78-80ºF., At this point about 4 hours should have passed from the time you initially mixed the dough. The dough should have risen 30-40%, have some scattered bubbles over the top of the dough, pull away from the sides and start to dome toward the center and feel more elastic. If it doesn't look that way, let it keep fermenting for another 30 minutes and check again. Check your dough temperature and make sure your dough is in the 78-80ºF range., Cold Bulk Fermentation: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid and put it in the refrigerator to rest overnight. The dough can stay in the refrigerator for 12 to 48 hours. See recipe notes for instructions on baking the same day., Pre-heat the Oven: The next morning (or whenever you are ready to bake your bread), put a dutch oven into your oven with the lid on and set the oven to 500ºF. Preheat the dutch oven by leaving it in the oven for 30 minutes., Shaping: Immediately after setting the dutch oven to preheat, pull out a piece of parchment paper. Take your dough out of the fridge. Dump dough on the counter and use your hands to shape the dough into a round ball, gently dragging the dough on the counter as you shape it into a ball. The dough should be fairly easy to work with because it is cold. Use wet hands if the dough is sticky., Scoring: When your dutch oven has preheated for 30 minutes, score the top of your bread with a bread lame (affiliate link), sharp knife or razor., Bake the Bread: Take the dutch oven out of the oven. Warning: This is a VERY HOT dutch oven. Keep those oven mitts on and be very careful not to burn yourself. Take the top off the dutch oven and place the dough and parchment paper into the dutch oven. Place the top back on the dutch oven and close the oven door. Immediately decrease the baking temperature to 450 degrees and bake for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, take the top off the dutch oven and continue baking for 20 more minutes. The internal temperature should be 205ºF when finished baking., Pull the bread out of the oven. Wait until cool to cut into it.

207760fc,https://vanillaandbean.com/rustic-sourdough-bread/,Rustic Sourdough Bread Recipe,"1/2 cup (100 grams) Sourdough Starter (100% hydration, previously feed and bubbly), 1 1/2 cup + 1 tablespoon (350 grams) Water (80 Fahrenheit (26 Celcius)* see note for a lower hydration tip), 2 tablespoons (40 grams) Maple Syrup ( or honey), 1/2 C + 2 tablespoons (100 grams) Whole Wheat Flour, 2 1/2 cups + 1 tablespoon (375 grams) Unbleached Bread Flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons (13 grams) Fine Sea Salt","Mix the Dough: In the evening, whisk the starter, water, and maple syrup together in a large bowl with a fork. Add the flours and salt. First, mix with a fork, the dough will be shaggy. Then mix by hand, mixing, folding and pushing the dough until the flour is fully incorporated and no dry bits are present. It will seem dry at first, but the more you work the dough, the more hydrated it will become. The dough will become moist and sticky and it will stick to your fingers as you go. Do this for about 3-4 minutes. Use the fork to scrape off the dough on your fingers as much as you can. Cover bowl with a damp tea towel. Set a timer for for 45 minutes and allow the dough to rest for 45 minutes. Now is a good time to feed/refresh your starter., Fold the Dough: After the dough has rested, fold the dough. To do this, grab a portion of the dough while it remains in the bowl, stretch it up and fold it over, pressing your fingertips into the center of the dough. You'll notice the dough is sticky and stretchy at this point. Repeat, until you've worked your way around the dough. This is the first fold, and you can stop here and begin bulk fermentation, but If time permits, and optimally, you'll want to repeat at least one to two more times as it improves the final dough's structure and crumb. Allow for about 45 minutes between folds., Bulk Fermentation (first rise): After the last fold, cover the bowl with two damp towels and allow to rise overnight at room temperature (see note** on optionally retarding the dough). This will take about 8-10 hours at 70 Fahrenheit (21 Celsius), but in a cooler kitchen the dough can take up to 12-14 hours to rise - this is the norm in my chilly kitchen at 68 Fahrenheit (18 Celsius). Use the time as a guide and not a determining factor. The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense, is jiggly when the bowl is wiggled, and has about doubled in size. You may see some bubbles on top of the dough., Shape the Dough: In the morning, and with damp fingertips, coax the dough into a floured work-surface. Pre Shape: With moist fingers, take a portion of the dough, gently stretch it towards you and fold it over towards the center, pressing it down gently. Repeat this process until you work all the way around the dough. Using a bench scraper flip the dough over, cover with a tea towel rest the dough for about 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, line a 10 inch oval banneton with a flour sack (as seen in the photos) or you can lightly dust the banneton with flour (I like to dust with white rice flour). Alternatively, you can use a 9 inch round banneton or bowl, following my Multigrain Sourdough Bread for shaping.Shape the Dough: Flour the work surface and using a bench scraper flip the dough back over. Use the photos in the blog post to help guide shaping. Gently shape the dough into a rough rectangle by gently dimpling the dough (think focaccia), to roughly 6-7 inches wide and 8-9 inches long. Fold the short side 2/3 over onto itself towards you and crease it firmly using the pinky side of your hand. Fold the bottom 1/3 piece up towards the crease and pinch the seam closed. Fold in the ends, coming in about an 3/4 inch - 1 inch and pinch the seam closed. Flip the bread over, seam sides down and rock it back and fourth a bit and gently fluff the ends in. Cover with a tea towel and allow the dough to rest for about 5-10 minutes. Using lightly floured hands and/or your bench scraper, cup the back of the dough and gently pull it towards you as needed until the surface is taught. Gently ""fluff"" the ends in again if needed to fit into the banneton. If not using a flour sack to line the banneton, sprinkle flour over the surface of the dough and smooth it around with the palm of your hand, covering the top and sides of the dough. Once the surface of the dough is taut and with one swift move, use the bench scraper to scoop the dough up and, place the dough into the prepared banneton - bottom side up., Proof the Dough (second rise): Cover the banneton with a damp tea towel and let rest for 30 minutes to 45 minutes. The dough is ready when it looks puffy and has risen slightly but has not doubled in size. Get Ready to Bake: Preheat the oven to 475 Fahrenheit (245 Celsius). Arrange an oven rack in the center of the oven and place a sheet pan on the bottom rack. This helps prevent a *too* dark bottom. Cut a sheet of parchment paper large enough to fit the size of your lidded baking vessel, I use a 10 Inch Cast Iron Skillet with Deep Dish Skillet for a lid. Crumble the parchment paper, then uncrumble the parchment, and smooth it open for easier handling., Score: To turn the dough out of the banneton, place the parchment over the dough and invert the banneton to release onto the parchment. Using the tip of a lame or a razor blade, score the dough about 1/2 inch (8 millimeters) deep, off center, in an gentle arch shape the length of the dough or any way you like. Use the parchment to transfer the dough to the baking vessel and place the lid on the vessel., Bake the Dough: Place the vessel into the oven, on the center rack, and bake for 30 minutes at 475 Fahrenheit (245 Celsius) with the lid on. Remove the lid, reduce the oven temperature to 450 Fahrenheit (232 Celsius) and continue baking for another 10-15 minutes tenting the loaf with foil if it starts getting too dark (my ear always gets extra dark).The bread is ready when the internal temperature of the loaf is between 190 - 205 Fahrenheit (87 - 96 Celsius). When done, transfer the bread to a wire rack. Cool completely before slicing., Storage Notes: Sourdough is best consumed on the same day it's baked, but it lasts for 3-4 days stored at room temperature. Store at room temperature cut side down.This bread freezes beautifully. Store baked bread, sliced, in a freezer bag either whole or sliced for up to two weeks. Thaw at room temperature.

Alternatively, cover dough and refrigerate overnight (no need for it to rise first, pop it right in the fridge)., When dough has risen, scrape out onto a generously floured surface and form into a ball with your hands. If the dough is too sticky to handle, sprinkle a light amount of flour over the surface, adding more as needed to handle/shape the dough., Stretch and fold: Grasp the dough at the top (think 12 o’clock, if the dough were a clock face) and stretch it over the bottom (6 o’clock). Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat. Repeat this step two more times for a total of 4 stretch and folds. I demonstrate this in the photos above and in the video, if a visual helps!, Use your hands to form the dough into a ball again (don't be afraid to shape it, you want it to be more round than flat!), place on a large piece of parchment paper (the parchment should be large enough that you can lift it up and lower it into a Dutch oven), and lightly cover with plastic wrap., Allow dough to rest, covered, for 30 minutes.

Put your dough into the bowl and turn it over to coat both sides with oil., Cover the bowl with a towel and put in a warm place to rise. I like to put mine in my oven that is off. Allow to rise for about 1 hour, or until double in size., Gently push the air out of the dough with your fist. Lightly oil a cast iron skillet (I use a 10"" skillet, but an 8"" or 12"" will also work. See notes) or other oven proof skillet. Place the bread dough into the oiled skillet and dust the top of the dough lightly with flour.

At this point, the dough needs to be quite sticky. Stir in the chopped olives and ensure that they are equally distributed throughout the batter. (Alternatively, you can use your clean hands to mix and feel the stickiness.), Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let it sit in a warmer part of your house for 18-24 hours.In my tests, I found that the bread baked after 18 hours of rising time was perfect, but the 24-hour one was also good. One important thing to mention here is that at the end of the rising time you might see a thin (kind of hard - for the lack of a better word) layer at the top of the dough. Don’t be alarmed by that. In the next step, we will fold that into the dough and since it is a sticky one, the additional rising time will help soften it., Lightly flour a piece of parchment paper, gently remove the dough from the bowl, and place it onto the parchment. While removing, you will realize that it is quite sticky. However, if you take your time and gently pull it by folding it onto itself, you will see that it will come out easily without any dough remaining in the bowl. For a visual, be sure to watch the video below., Form the dough into a ball tucking the sides of the dough under. Lightly dust it with a little bit of flour, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size. Again, I recommend letting it sit in a warmer part of your house., Towards the end of the rising time, place your dutch oven in the oven and pre-heat it to 450 F degrees., When ready to bake, carefully take the now-very hot dutch oven out of the oven. Using the edges of the parchment paper place the dough into the dutch oven. Put the lid on and bake for 30 minutes. Then remove the lid and continue to bake another 20-30 minutes or until the top is nicely golden brown as you see in the photos., At the end of the baking, remove it from the dutch oven, place it onto a cooling rack and let it cool for 30-45 minutes before slicing.","[, (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', a, c, t, i, v, e,  , d, r, y,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', k, o, s, h, e, r,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', l, u, k, e, w, a, r, m,  , w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 3, 3, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', k, a, l, a, m, a, t, a,  , o, l, i, v, e, s, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ]"

c363f567,https://homesteadandchill.com/zucchini-sourdough-bread-recipe/,Rustic Zucchini and Walnut Sourdough Bread Recipe,"120 grams active sourdough starter, 455 grams total flour - we use 295 grams of white bread flour, 140 grams of whole wheat, and 20 grams of rye flour, 1.25 cups filtered water (in very humid climates, start with 1 cup of water and add more as needed), 9 grams salt - sea salt, kosher salt, or Himalayan salt is preferred over iodized table salt (plus a sprinkle on the zucchini), 1 medium zucchini, grated (approximately 1 to 1.5 cups, see sliding scale notes below), 1/2 cup walnuts - we use raw, unsalted, halves & pieces, optional: ½ tsp of garlic powder and 2 tsp of onion powder","Before making the dough, be sure to feed your sourdough starter at least twice, allowing it to reach peak activity level., Make an autolyse by combining the flour and water in a bowl until thoroughly mixed. Let it sit covered at room temperature (70-75 degrees is optimal) for about an hour. (The dough may seem more dry than usual sourdough, because the zucchini will add more moisture soon), While the autolyse is resting, prepare the zucchini - which also needs to sit and rest after grating. Use a box grater to shred one medium zucchini into a colander or strainer. Next, sprinkle the zucchini with a few light shakes of salt, and toss to mix. Rest the strainer in a very clean sink, or set it over a larger bowl. Over the next 15 to 30 minutes, the salt will draw excess water out of the zucchini. Toss and lightly press (wring out) the zucchini a few times while you wait - about 5 to 10 minutes apart. Do not add the collected zucchini water to the recipe!, After the autolyse has rested for nearly an hour, mix in the called-for active sourdough starter, salt, and grated drained zucchini until thoroughly combined. Mixing with your hands is normal and acceptable. (Also add optional ½ tsp of garlic powder and 2 tsp of onion powder)., Optional: Lift the dough ball (which may be quite loose) out of bowl and on a clean counter use the “slap and fold” technique to tighten the dough., Once finished, put the dough back in the bowl and allow to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel or similar. This begins the ""bulk fermentation"" time., After 30 minutes, add the walnuts and then start the first round of “stretch and fold” - gently lifting up on one side of the dough and folding it back over itself. Give the bowl a quarter turn and continue to stretch and fold the dough until it is taught and resists pulling. Avoid tearing the dough. Use wet hands to prevent sticking. Cover the bowl again, and let sit., Repeat the stretch and fold process every 30 minutes for a total of 3 or 4 rounds., After about 4 hours of bulk fermentation at room temperature, stretch and fold the dough one final time to help it tighten up., Next, set the dough on a lightly floured surface and shape the loaf into a similar shape as your banneton (proofing basket - e.g. a round loaf, or long oval loaf). Let the dough “bench rest” for a final 10 minutes., After the final bench rest, place the dough in a flour-dusted (and potentially cloth-lined) banneton proofing basket of choice. Cover with a breathable towel, and place in the refrigerator to proof for 8 to 16 hours. We usually do this overnight., After cold-proofing in the refrigerator, preheat the oven to 475 to 500 degrees F. (Experiment to see what temperature works best for your oven). If you’re using a dutch oven or combo cooker, place it in the oven to preheat for one hour., After an hour of preheating, quickly and carefully transfer the cold dough (straight from the fridge) out of the banneton and into the hot combo cooker or dutch oven. Line the combo cooker or dutch oven with parchment paper first. Score the top of the loaf with a bread lame if desired. (See Note 1 below), Bake the loaf covered for approximately 40 minutes, and then remove the lid and bake for an additional 5 minutes uncovered. (See Note 2 and Note 3 below), Once done, immediately remove the finished sourdough loaf from the oven and combo cooker and place the loaf on a wire rack to cool., Let the sourdough bread loaf sit at room temperature for several hours before cutting. The steam trapped inside is important moisture to retain!, Enjoy!, To store your bread, I suggest wrapping it in a lint-free tea towel before putting it inside a paper bag. That way, you can enjoy it over four to five days.

Sprinkle almost all of the cinnamon sugar evenly on top (reserve about 2 Tablespoons for topping). It’s a very thick layer of cinnamon sugar. Carefully pour/spread remaining batter evenly on top. The top layer of batter will want to stick to the cinnamon sugar filling, making spreading a little tougher to do, but use a spoon to carefully spread it out as best you can. Sprinkle with the rest of the cinnamon sugar. Using a knife, make a large swirl down the loaf pan, as shown in the video tutorial below. Avoid over-swirling, which will mix the layers together too much., Bake the bread for 50-65 minutes, covering loosely with foil about halfway through to prevent the top from over-browning.

Loosely cover and allow to sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy and frothy on top. *If you do not own a stand mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon or silicone spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula is a better choice.*, Add the remaining sugar, the butter, 1 cup flour (about 130g), and the salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula, then add another cup of flour. Beat on medium speed until relatively incorporated (there may still be chunks of butter). Add the remaining flour and beat on medium speed until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes. If the dough seems too wet to a point where kneading (next step) would be impossible, beat in more flour 1 Tablespoon at a time until you have a workable dough. Dough should be soft and a little tacky, but still manageable to knead with lightly floured hands., Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 8–10 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 8–10 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need; you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading., 1st Rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1.5-2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter. Takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), Grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan. (I usually use this one or this one.), For the swirl, In a small bowl, whisk 1/4 cup (50g) sugar and the cinnamon together., Shape the dough, When the dough is ready, punch it down to release the air. Lightly flour a work surface, your hands, and a rolling pin. Roll the dough out into a large 8×20 inch rectangle. It does not have to be perfect—in fact, it will probably be rounded on the edges. That’s ok! Using a pastry brush, brush the surface with beaten egg white, then sprinkle on the cinnamon-sugar, leaving a 1-inch border uncovered. Roll it up into an 8-inch log. Place the loaf, seam-side down, into the prepared loaf pan. If any cinnamon-sugar filling spilled out of the sides, don’t waste it! Sprinkle it on top of the bread in the loaf pan., 2nd Rise, Cover the shaped loaf and allow to rise for 1 hour, or until it’s about 1 inch above the top of the loaf pan., Adjust oven rack to a lower position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). (It’s best to bake the bread towards the bottom of the oven so the top doesn’t burn.), After the dough rises, melt the remaining 1 Tablespoon of butter. Using a pastry brush again, gently brush it on top of the loaf. Be gentle, so as not to deflate the dough. Bake for 35–45 minutes, or until golden brown. Check on the bread about halfway through baking—if the top of the loaf is browning too quickly, tent with aluminum foil. To test for doneness, if you gently tap on the loaf, it should sound hollow. For a more accurate test, the bread is done when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf registers 195–200°F (90–93°C)., Remove from the oven and allow bread to cool for a few minutes in the pan on a cooling rack. Remove loaf from the pan and cool it directly on a cooling rack for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Feel free to let it cool completely before slicing, too., Cover leftover bread tightly and store at room temperature for 6 days or in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, i, n, n, a, m, o, n, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ]"

Let it rise until it is about double, 30 minutes., Topping: In a pie dish, whisk the melted butter and corn syrup together. In a separate dish, whisk together the sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon., Preheat the oven to 350º and line two nine by five inch loaf pans with parchment paper., Cut 4 deep slashes across the top of each loaf, cutting about half way through. The dough will be very soft and will deflate as you work with it. Dip each loaf into the butter mixture, turning to coat both sides. Then place it in the brown sugar mixture making sure it is completely coated and the topping has gone into the slashes. Place in the loaf pans., Pour the remaining butter mixture over each loaf. Sprinkle the remaining brown sugar mixture over the top. Bake until lightly brown, about 25 minutes. Lift the bread out of the pans and let cool on a baking rack for about 15 minutes.","[, (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 7, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, i, n, n, a, m, o, n, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 6, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, o, r, n,  , s, y, r, u, p, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ]"

Set aside., In a saucepan, set over medium heat, melt the butter. When melted, turn off the heat and pour in the milk and vanilla. The residual heat from the pan will warm the milk., Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand-up mixer with the dough attachment (alternatively you could do this by hand with a spatula), add the bread flour, sugar, instant yeast and kosher salt. Give a mix until combined. And then pour in the egg and egg yolk, butter/milk mixture and knead until combined and smooth, about 5 minutes. Grease a bowl with some oil or cooking spray and transfer the dough to the bowl. Put it in a warm and cozy place in your house so it can rise for 1 hour, or doubled in size., To Make the Filling:, In a small bowl, combine the cinnamon, white sugar, brown sugar and salt. Melt the butter and set aside., To Assemble the Swirl Bread:, Grease a 8x4-inch loaf pan and set aside., Lightly flour your work surface. Punch down the dough and roll it out into an 8x18-inch rectangle. Brush it with half of the melted butter and sprinkle with the filling. It should be an even layer of cinnamon and sugar. Pour the remaining butter on top of the filling. This will help moisten the filling to help it stick when we roll it up., Tightly roll the log up and pinch the seams. Carefully transfer it to the loaf pan, seam-side down. Cover it and place it in a warm place in your house for 1 hour, until it’s about 1 inch out of loaf pan., To Bake the Swirl Bread:, Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the top with the egg wash. Transfer to the oven to bake until golden brown, about 35 minutes., Allow it cool in the pan for 10 minutes and then transfer to a cooling rack. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Slice it up and eat it with softened butter.","[, (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 0, ., 7, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', v, a, n, i, l, l, a,  , e, x, t, r, a, c, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', c, i, n, n, a, m, o, n, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ]"

Don’t worry about getting it all to dissolve. (I added the yeast, then the flour and then the salt on top of the flour to avoid killing any of the yeast, but apparently this is unnecessary.), Mix in the flour: Add all of the flour at once, measuring it with dry-ingredient measuring cups, by gently scooping the flour, then sweeping the top level with a knife or spatula; don’t press down into the flour as you scoop or you’ll throw off the measurement by compressing. Mix with a wooden spoon. If necessary, reach into your mixing vessel with very wet hands and press the mixture together. Don’t knead! It isn’t necessary. You’re finished when everything is uniformly moist, without dry patches. Dough should be wet and loose enough to conform to the shape of the container., Allow to rise: Cover with a lid (not airtight) that fits well to the container you’re using. Allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse (or at least flattens on the top), approximately two hours. You can use a portion of the dough any time after this period, but fully refrigerated dough is less sticky and is easier to work with. So, the first time you try this method, it’s best to refrigerate the dough overnight before shaping a loaf.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 6, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ]"

88098631,https://amybakesbread.com/cinnamon-raisin-sourdough-bread/,Cinnamon Raisin Sourdough Bread,"35 grams sourdough starter (ripe, bubbly, active), 35 grams water, 35 grams all-purpose or bread flour, 100 grams levain (ripe, bubbly, active), 400 grams water (25 grams reserved for AFTER the fermentolyse), 450 grams bread flour (12.5% protein content, see recipe notes), 50 grams whole wheat flour, 10 grams salt (reserved for AFTER the fermentolyse), 120 grams raisins (about 1 cup, reserved for after stretch and folds), 58 grams unsalted butter, softened (about 4 Tablespoons), 60 grams brown sugar (about 1/4 cup), 6 grams ground cinnamon (about 2 teaspoons), 3 grams all-purpose or bread flour (about 1 teaspoon), pinch of salt","Day 1: Levain/Mix/Bulk Fermentation/Shape/Cold Bulk Fermentation (keep dough at 78ºF for best results), Levain: Mix together 35 grams ripe sourdough starter, 35 grams all-purpose or bread flour and 35 grams water. Set aside to ripen for 3-4 hours, keeping the temperature at 78ºF. Levain is ready when it has doubled in size, is very bubbly, smells milky sweet and is just about to fall., Fermentolyse: Once the levain is peaked and active, mix 100 grams levain with 375 grams of water in a large bowl. Warm the water if the ingredients are too cold and cool the water if ingredients are too warm. Add the 450 grams bread flour and 50 grams whole wheat flour to the bowl and mix until incorporated and a shaggy dough forms. Let rest for 30 minutes., Mixing: After 30 minutes, add the reserved salt and reserved 25 grams of water. Combine using your hands by squeezing the dough between your fingers, pinching chunks of dough and reincorporating together. The dough will break apart and then reform in the bowl through this process. Pick up one side of the dough and fold it over on itself. The dough will be sticky. Wet your hands as needed and continue to work with the dough, slapping it against the side of the bowl and stretching it back until all the salt and water have been incorporated and the dough is cohesive and strong. Alternatively you can perform this step in a stand mixer. Transfer the dough to a plastic container or bowl if desired., Bulk Fermentation: Perform 3-4 sets of ""stretch and folds,"" adding the raisins in during the second set., To “stretch and fold,” wet your hand (so it doesn’t stick to the dough). Reach down to the bottom of the bowl of dough and pull the dough up and over the top of the dough. Turn the bowl 1/4 turn and repeat the stretch and fold. Turn another quarter turn and repeat. Perform one more 1/4 turn with stretching and folding the dough. Cover and set aside for 30 minutes., Add raisins: Before performing the second set of stretch and folds, add the raisins on top of the dough. Stretch and fold the dough again, incorporating the raisins in as you go. Cover and set aside for 30 minutes. Repeat the third and fourth set of stretch and folds every 30 minutes for the next hour., Bulk Fermentation Continued: Let the dough rest in a warm place, for the rest of bulk fermentation, about 2-3 hours at 78ºF. During this time the dough will puff up about 30-40%, become more aerated, start to pull away from the edges of the bowl and have a few scattered bubbles around the edges/top of the dough. If your dough is not showing these signs, make sure it's warm enough and give it another half an hour or so until it is showing signs that it's ready to shape., Mix Cinnamon Filling: Mix together 58 grams softened butter, 60 grams brown sugar, 6 grams ground cinnamon, 3 grams flour and a pinch of salt until it forms a paste. Set aside., Prepare Bowl: Prepare a bowl or banneton with a liner or sprinkle liberally with rice flour., Shaping: When the dough is showing signs that it's ready to shape, dump the dough out onto the countertop. Gently pull the dough into a 12 by 12 square shape. It does NOT need to be very thinly stretched, see post pictures for example. Dollop most of the cinnamon mixture on the top of the dough. Fold one side of the dough to the middle and then the other side of the dough to the middle. Add the rest of the cinnamon sugar mixture on top of that dough. Then roll the dough up into a cylinder or circular shape. Immediately place the dough in the prepared banneton basket without too much handling of the dough. Cinnamon sugar tends to release moisture in the dough making it necessary to work quickly and get it in the banneton., Cold Bulk Fermentation: Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a shower cap and store in the refrigerator overnight for about 18-24 hours. Alternatively you can let your dough rise outside the fridge for another 3-4 hours and then bake your loaf the same day. If you choose this method, stick your banneton or bowl of dough in the fridge or freezer to chill it for a few minutes before scoring., Day 2: Bake, Pre-heat the Oven: Put a Dutch oven (top and all) into the oven and preheat to 500ºF. Allow the Dutch oven to heat for about 30 minutes at 500ºF., Once preheated for 30 minutes, pull the loaf out of the refrigerator. Remove the plastic wrap or shower cap (this is easy to do straight out of the refrigerator if the dough is chilled – not easy if the dough warms up) and place a piece of parchment paper on top of the bread dough. Flip the dough over so that the dough is now sitting on the parchment paper. Take off the bowl banneton and liner., Scoring: Smooth flour over the top of the dough (add a little extra for more contrast if desired) or leave the flour off completely for no contrast. Use a bread lame or very sharp knife to score the dough. Bread with inclusions typically does not score quite as well as bread without. This is not a loaf for intricate scoring. One large slash, about 1 inch deep is sufficient., Bake: Carefully remove the Dutch oven from the 500ºF oven with hot pads. Take the top off and place your bread into the Dutch oven (including parchment paper – this helps with the transfer). Be very careful not to touch the sides of the hot Dutch oven. Put your hot pads back on before you pick up the lid of the Dutch oven and place it on top of the bread. Put the whole Dutch oven back into the oven. Lower the temperature to 450ºF and bake for 25 minutes. Once 20 minutes are up, take the top off the Dutch oven and lower the temperature again to 400ºF. Continue baking for 20 minutes until the bread is fully baked with an internal temperature of 205ºF.

Then add flour and salt and mix whole lot together until it forms a sticky dough. You don't want any dry flour left at all.You can use a dough scraper or Danish dough whisk for this process., Cover your bowl with cling film or a damp tea towel and let it sit for around 1 hour. It's ok if it's a little bit longer, it's not going to matter too much., Strengthening the DoughAfter the dough has been through autolyse you need to bring it together into a ball. Work your way around the bowl, grabbing the dough from the outside, stretching it up and over itself, into the centre. You should feel the dough strengthen as you do this. It doesn't have to be perfectly smooth or tight, just work around the bowl stretching and folding (around 10 - 15 times is perfect)., Bulk Ferment:Now you want to leave your dough to ferment. Cover it with a tea towel or plastic wrap and leave it alone to double (see notes).Focaccia is super forgiving so it doesn't need to be perfectly doubled - near enough is fine., Shaping Focaccia:Once the dough has doubled you need to shape the dough. Shaping focaccia is super simple (and absolutely forgiving). See my notes in the post above for details on baking pans/dishes.Use a dough scraper to gently ease the dough out into your desired pan., Rub your hands with a little olive oil and gently pull the dough out to fill the tray. Again it doesn't have to be perfect as it will naturally fill the tray as it proofs., Second Rise:Let your dough rise again. Leave it until it's spread out and filled the tray. It will be puffy and pillowy ... you might even have some gorgeous bubbles popping up., Topping:Once the dough has filled the tray and is looking puffy and full of volume, you need to dimple the dough and add the toppings.Sprinkle the cinnamon and brown sugar over the top of the dough so you get an even coverage. Then pour the melted butter over the dough. Then use your finger tips to gently dimple the focaccia dough and push all the brown sugar, cinnamon and melted butter into the dough., Baking Sourdough Focaccia:Preheat the oven to 200C (392F).Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown. Once baked through, remove from the oven and carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool. Don't leave it in the tin as it will sweat., Frosting:Whisk the frosting ingredients together until it forms a smooth, slightly runny paste. Add it to a piping bag and then drizzle it over the cinnamon roll sourdough focaccia.","[, (, ', s, o, u, r, d, o, u, g, h,  , s, t, a, r, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 4, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 5, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 5, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 3, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, r, o, u, n, d,  , c, i, n, n, a, m, o, n, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, o, w, n,  , s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 5, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 5, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, r, e, a, m,  , c, h, e, e, s, e, ', ,,  , 1, 2, 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, o, w, d, e, r, e, d,  , s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', v, a, n, i, l, l, a,  , e, x, t, r, a, c, t, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ]"

I like to do this by placing milk in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving it for 40-45 seconds. It should be like warm bath water. Transfer warm milk to the bowl of an electric mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Add in sugar, egg, egg yolk and melted butter. Mix until well combined. Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form., Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it's TOO sticky (meaning it's sticking to the bottom of the mixer, add in 2 tablespoons more bread flour.) If you don’t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface., Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour to 1 ½ hours, or until doubled in size. This may more or less time depending the humidity and temperature in your home., After dough has doubled in size, transfer dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a 14x9 inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over dough, leaving a ¼ inch margin at the far side of the dough., In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter., Tightly roll dough up, starting from the 9-inch side and place seam side down making sure to seal the edges of the dough as best you can. You will probably need to cut off about an inch off the ends of the dough as the ends won’t be as full of cinnamon sugar as we’d want it to be., Cut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife or floss. You should get 9 large pieces., Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x9 inch baking pan or round 9 inch cake pan.

Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30-45 minutes., Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. You want to underbake them a little so they stay soft in the middle, that’s why we want them just slightly golden brown. Allow them to cool for 5-10 minutes before frosting. Makes 9 cinnamon rolls., To make the frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth and fluffy.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook (or in a large bowl if making by hand), combine 6 cups of the flour, yeast, salt and 1/2 cup of the cinnamon/sugar mixture. With the mixer on low speed, add the milk mixture and mix until the dough comes together. Increase the speed to medium, adding more flour as necessary so the dough clears the sides of the bowl but remains slightly sticky. Knead the dough (in the mixer or by hand) until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes (you'll need to knead upwards of 15 minutes by hand to achieve the same consistency)., Place the dough in a large, lightly greased bowl and cover with greased plastic wrap. Let it rise until doubled in size, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours., Grease three 8 1/2-inch by 4 1/2-inch bread pans. Turn the dough onto a lightly greased work surface and separate the dough into three equal pieces. Working with one piece at a time, press the dough into an 8-inch by 14-inch rectangle. Very lightly spray the surface of the dough - only 1-2 light sprays. You don't want the water to puddle on the dough; you want a very fine mist of water across the dough. Sprinkle the dough with 1/3 of the remaining cinnamon/sugar mixture, leaving a 1/2-inch border along one of the short edges. Gently press the cinnamon/sugar mixture into the dough. Again, lightly spray the top of the dough (now sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar) with water. Don't let the water puddle, just spray a very fine, light mist across the top, 1-3 sprays., Roll the dough into a tight cylinder starting with the short edge without the border. The key is to roll the dough as tightly as possible to avoid any gaps in the swirl (I don't get this perfect every time so don't worry if there are a few gaps after baking). Pinch the seam closed once it is rolled up all the way. Place the loaf, seam side down, in one of the prepared pans and repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Cover the pans with lightly greased plastic wrap and let rise until nearly doubled in size, about an hour., Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Brush the loaf very gently with melted butter and sprinkle the reserved cinnamon/sugar mixture over the tops of the loaves (dividing evenly). Bake for 40-60 minutes until baked through. If the bread seems like it is overbrowning on top too quickly, place a piece of tin foil tented lightly over each loaf to finish baking. Cool the loaf in the pan for 10 minutes (too long and it will stick to the pan!) and then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.","[, (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, o, w, n,  , s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, i, n, n, a, m, o, n, ', ,,  , 2, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 2, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 6, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, s, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 8, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ]"

Using a sturdy spoon mix in the milk, vanilla, and soft butter. Mix well until no dry ingredients can be seen. Mix in 1/2 cup flour and add more flour as necessary to get a dough that you can pinch and it doesn't stick to your fingers but still feels soft., Turn the dough onto a lightly floured counter or cutting board. Knead for 2 minutes until the dough is smooth looking. You don't need to knead the dough for long., Place the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rest for one hour. The dough should double in size., Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside., In a small bowl whisk together the sugar and cinnamon for the filling. Measure out the milk and set aside. Don't mix the milk with the cinnamon sugar., Divide the dough into four equal pieces. On an unfloured surface, lightly roll the pieces into rounds. Don't compress or squish them. Just roll them a little to make them round., Roll one dough ball into a 10"" disc. It should be fairly thin but be careful to not rip or tear the dough. Place the rolled piece onto the parchment lined baking sheet. Brush a little milk onto the dough, leaving 1/4"" edge, and then sprinkle 1/3 of the cinnamon sugar onto the dough. Again, leaving a 1/4"" edge., Roll out the second piece of dough into a 10"" disc. Place onto the first layer, gently press to remove any air pockets. Brush with milk, sprinkle on sugar, and repeat for the third piece. Roll out the final dough ball and place on top. Gently press down to remove air pockets and to get the edges to stick together., Use the bottom of a drinking glass, about 2"" diameter, to gently make an impression in the center of your dough. Remove the glass. Using a sharp knife, cut the dough straight down up to the impression in the center. Start with making four cuts in the dough so that it's divided into quarters, then divide the quarters so you have eight cuts, then divide the eight so you have 16 total cuts., Hold two of the pieces and twist them in opposite directions three times. Pinch the end together. Repeat until you have 8 points on your snowflake bread!, Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes. Brush the exposed dough, not the cinnamon layers, with a little milk then bake for 25 minutes. Let cool for 10-15 minutes before serving.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, add the eggs, milk, sugar, and sourdough starter. Whisk together until incorporated. Add the flour and salt and mix on speed 1 for 3 minutes until incorporated. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. After the 10-minute rest turn the mixer to speed 2 and mix for about 5-6 minutes until the dough starts to come together and all clumps have disappeared. The dough should start to pull from the sides of the bowl but it will not completely remove from the bottom. If the dough just doesn’t want to come together and it’s overly wet add a little flour, a tablespoon at a time until it comes together. With the mixer set to speed 1, add the butter one pat at a time, waiting to add each until the previous is absorbed. Continue until all the butter is added and the dough is shiny and smooth, this could take around 8-10 minutes., Bulk fermentation (9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.)Transfer the mixed dough to a bulk container and let ferment for 2 hours at 75ºF (23°C). Perform 3 to 4 sets of stretch and folds at 30-minute intervals., Chill dough (11:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.)Place the covered bulk fermentation container into the fridge for at least 2 hours to thoroughly chill., Shape rolls (2:00 p.m.)First, make the filling. In a bowl mix together the filling ingredients and set aside. Next, take out your dough from the fridge, lightly flour your work surface and the dough, and roll out to an 11×21″ rectangle with a long side closest to your body. Spread the filling evenly over the dough. roll the dough up away from you into a tight log. Cut the log into pieces every 1 3/4″. Transfer the cut pieces to a baking pan with space around each one., Proof (2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.)Cover the pan and proof somewhere warm, around 77°F (25°C), for 2 to 3 hours. The dough will relax and puff up during this time. They’re ready to bake when the dough feels very soft and light—give the dough additional time to proof if necessary., Bake (4:30 p.m.)Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Slide the rolls into the oven once preheated and bake for 20-25 minutes. Spread the glaze over the rolls once cooled.","[, (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 4, 7, 7, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 1, 3, 3, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, 9, 1, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, s, ', ,,  , 1, 9, 1, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 4, 8, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, 1, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, o, u, r, d, o, u, g, h,  , s, t, a, r, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, 0, 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, o, w, n,  , s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, 1, 5, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 4, 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, i, n, n, a, m, o, n, ', ,,  , 2, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, r, e, a, m,  , c, h, e, e, s, e, ', ,,  , 1, 1, 4, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, o, w, d, e, r, e, d,  , s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 6, 2, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 3, 7, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', v, a, n, i, l, l, a,  , e, x, t, r, a, c, t, ', ,,  , 1, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ]"

Drain, reserving ½ cup soaking liquid., Pour reserved soaking liquid into a large bowl. Add the yeast and whisk together until thoroughly combined. Let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes., Meanwhile, heat milk until warm - about 30 seconds in the microwave should do. Add the warmed milk, butter, salt and flour to the yeast mixture, stirring everything until it comes together to form a shaggy ball. Then knead the dough by hand (or with a dough hook attachment) until it’s smooth and elastic - this will take about 10 minutes (or less if using a stand mixer)., Toss the plumped craisins with 1 tablespoon flour to absorb any residual moisture., Roll out dough to a 10""x8"" rectangle. Sprinkle half of the craisins in the center third of the rectangle. Fold one short edge of the dough over the craisins to cover them and pat down firmly. Sprinkle the remaining craisins on top of the folded-over dough. Fold the other short edge of the dough over the craisins to cover them and pat down firmly. Knead the dough by hand for a few minutes to evenly distribute the craisins., Shape dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and let it rise until doubled in size, 1-2 hours., In a small bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon.

This time can greatly vary by the temperature of your kitchen and the strength of your starter. Watch your dough, not the clock. It helps me to use a straight sided dough bucket (I have this one and really like it) so I can see how much my dough has risen. Let it rise until it is almost, but not fully, doubled in size., Take your dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured countertop, Pat it into a rectangle about the width of your loaf pan and twice that long., Make the egg wash by mixing the egg with one tablespoon water and whisking vigorously., Brush an even layer onto the top of the dough.

Leave a small 1 inch border on one of the shorter ends to seal the bread together., Roll the bread up in a tight log and place into a buttered or greased loaf pan., Second Rise, Cover the pan and let the loaf rise until it has doubled in size again. This usually takes around 2 hours. I will set myself a timer for 1.5 hours and check on my dough. If it is not ready at that point set another timer to check on it every 30 minutes until it is ready to bake., Bake, Preheat the oven to 350 degrees., Bake the bread 35-45 minutes.

82709499,https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2017/12/how-to-make-sourdough-cinnamon-rolls-step-by-step-guide/,Soft Sourdough Cinnamon Rolls,"160 g (2/3 cup) milk, whole or 2%, 28 g (2 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted (see notes below for variation), 1 large egg, 100 g (1/2 cup) bubbly, active sourdough starter, 24 g (2 tbsp) granulated sugar, 300 g (2½ cups) King Arthur all-purpose flour, 5 g (1 tsp) fine sea salt, cooking spray or oil, for coating, 28 g (2 tbsp) unsalted butter (see notes below for variation), 100 g (1/2 cup) granulated sugar, 3 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1 level tbsp. flour, 2 tbsp unsalted butter, softened, ⅓ cup whipped cream cheese, room temperature, ¼- 1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted (add more if you like it sweet!), 1-2 tbsp milk, For a richer dough, increase the butter to 115 (8 tbsp) and use 360 g (3 cups) flour total. The texture is incredible., Make sure the melted butter and milk mixture has cooled slightly before making the dough. If it’s too hot, the dough will become incredibly sticky like cake batter (I’ve experienced this many times). If this happens to you, don’t worry- wait for the dough to cool down before adding more flour, if needed., Recent recipe update: to prevent the cinnamon sugar filling from leaking while the rolls bake, instead of using 28g (2 tbsp) of melted butter, combine 84 g (6 tbsp) softened butter with the rest of the cinnamon-sugar filling ingredients listed above.","Baker's Schedule, Overnight Option, Make the dough in the evening and let rise overnight. The following morning, roll, cut and shape the dough. Rest for 1-2 hours (second rise) before baking., As an alternative, after resting for 1 hour, cover the dough and chill until ready to use. Rest at room temperature before baking. The dough should be plump and puffy before baking., Make-Ahead Option (Freeze): Place the cut & shaped cinnamon rolls into a parchment lined 9-inch springform pan. Cover with two layers of plastic wrap. Freeze until ready to use. The night before baking, remove the old plastic wrap and replace with fresh wrap (this prevents any condensation from dripping onto the rolls). Defrost overnight, about 10-12 hrs. at room temperature, approximately 67 F. Bake the following morning as directed., Make the Dough, In the evening: Combine the melted butter and milk in a small bowl. Cool slightly before using., Add the egg, sourdough starter, and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix to combine. With the machine running, slowly pour in the milk mixture. Add the flour and salt. Continue mixing until a rough, sticky dough forms, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes., After the dough has rested, switch to the dough hook. Knead on medium-low speed for 6-8 minutes (I use #2 or #3 on my stand mixer). The dough should feel soft, supple and pull away from the sides of the bowl when ready. If it’s too sticky add a small bit of flour., Bulk Rise, Transfer the dough to a medium-size bowl coated in butter. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise overnight until double in size, about 8-12 + hrs. @ 67-68 F, depending on temperature., Stretch and Fold the Dough (optional step): about 30 minutes- 1 hr. into the bulk rise stretch and fold the dough: grab a portion of the dough and stretch it upward. Fold it over toward the center of the bowl. Give the bowl a 1/4 turn; stretch and fold the dough again. Continue this technique until you’ve come full circle around the bowl (4 folds total). For video guidance, click here. This optional step will increase the overall volume of the rolls and aerate the dough., Roll the Dough, In the morning: Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper. I like to scrunch the paper into a ball first, open it up, and then line the inside with enough excess to hang over the sides for easy removal. It tends to fit better this way., Lightly oil and flour your countertop to prevent sticking. Coax the dough out of the bowl. Gently pat into a rough rectangle. Let rest for 10 minutes for easier rolling., Dust the dough (and your rolling pin) with flour. Roll the dough into a 16 x 12-ish rectangle using a tape measure for accuracy. If the dough resists, let rest for 5-10 minutes and try again., Make the Cinnamon-Sugar Filling, If using the softened butter variation (listed in the notes above): add 84 g (6 tbsp) softened butter to a small bowl. Mix with the sugar, cinnamon and flour. With an offset spatula, spread onto the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges., If using the melted butter version: brush the entire surface of the dough, including the top, bottom and sides with 28 g (2 tbsp) melted butter. Use all of it. Combine the sugar, cinnamon and flour in a bowl. Sprinkle the mixture onto the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Smooth it out with your hands until it looks wet and sandy., Shape & Cut the Dough, Starting on the long side of the dough (16-inch), roll it into a log pressing down gently as you go. Take your time with this step. The log needs to be tight so the swirls stay in tact. You should end up seam side down. TIP: if the dough starts to get sticky from the heat of your hands, lightly oil or flour your fingertips, take a deep breath and try again., Cut the dough into 2-inch sections using a oiled knife or bench scraper. I lightly “mark” the dough first to make sure each piece is roughly the same size., Second Rise, Place the rolls into the lined pan and let rest for 1- 2 hours, or until the dough puffs up. Alternatively, if you’d like to chill or freeze the rolls, please refer to the “Make-Ahead” option in the Baker’s Schedule at the top of this recipe., Bake the Cinnamon Rolls, Preheat oven to 350 F. Bake the dough onto the center rack and bake for 35-40 minutes (check at the 30 minute mark). The tops should turn light golden brown when ready., Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 15 minutes. This helps the butter to absorb back into the dough. Then lift up the rolls, while still on the parchment paper, and transfer to a wire rack., Make the Glaze, While the rolls are baking or cooling make the glaze. Add softened butter, whipped cream cheese and sifted powdered sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat until smooth, thinning out the consistency with a little milk as needed. The ingredients must be soft and at room temperature for best results., To serve, top the rolls with some of the glaze or lightly dust with powdered sugar. These rolls are best enjoyed slightly warm on the same day they are baked.","[, (, ', m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 1, 6, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, 8, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', s, o, u, r, d, o, u, g, h,  , s, t, a, r, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, 4, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, 8, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, i, n, n, a, m, o, n, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, 8, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, r, e, a, m,  , c, h, e, e, s, e, ', ,,  , 0, ., 3, 3, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, 1, 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, 6, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 8, 4, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ]"

(Liquid should be between 110-115 degrees to proof yeast which means it should feel warm, but not too hot to the touch.) Add the yeast and a pinch of sugar to the milk. Stir to combine and then let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes., In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine flour, sugar, and salt., Slowly add the yeast/milk mixture and mix on medium speed until combined. With the mixture running, add the eggs one at a time. When the eggs are combined, add butter piece by piece ensuring that it is mixed in before adding more. At this point, the dough will be very wet and sticky, that’s ok- just keep mixing!, Increase the speed to medium high and continue mixing for about 8 minutes, until the dough is smooth., Place dough into a greased bowl, cover with a damp towel and let rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in size., When the dough has proofed, punch it down and then cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

Roll the dough to a large rectangle, about 9x18 inches in size., Use an small offset spatula (or a spoon) to spread the cinnamon filling over the surface of the rectangle, leaving about a 1/2 inch at the edges., Beginning with the short side, roll brioche tightly to create a log. Trim 1” off of the ends of the log. Slice the long in half lengthwise, leaving the top 2 inches unsliced. At this point, you should have one piece of dough with two “legs”. The pieces should be facing up so that the layers of filling are visible. Begin to twist the two pieces over and under each other, to create something that resembles a braid. Pinch the ends and then place the braid in a greased loaf pan., Cover the brioche with a towel and let rise again, about an hour, until it has almost doubled in size., Bake in a 350 degree oven for 30-35 minutes, until golden brown and a skewer comes out clean.

Stir everything until evenly mixed (break up any raisin clumps)., Add the warm water and stir. If the dough does not come into one cohesive ball (with no dry bits left at the bottom of the bowl) add a little more water, one tablespoon at a time, until it all comes together (see photos below). Loosely cover the bowl and let it rest for 2 hours at room temperature., After two hours the dough will have risen and grown to about twice the size. It will be a rough looking, shaggy ball of dough. Turn it out onto a floured surface. Give it maybe one or two turns or “kneads” in the flour just to work in enough flour to keep it from sticking to your hands. Flatten and stretch the dough into a long rectangle. The short side of the rectangle should be the same length as your bread pan, the long side double that., Sprinkle the cinnamon over the surface of the rectangle. If you want a sweeter bread, you can sprinkle on some additional brown sugar with the cinnamon. Roll the rectangle up and place it in a bread pan coated with non-stick spray.

Flour a table or work surface and knead the bread for 5-10 minutes., Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and brush the top with a little extra oil (I typically just use olive oil for this). Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 hour. It should be very puffy. Divide the dough in half and punch it down., Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Roll each half into a large rectangle. For more tight rolls in the bread, roll the dough thinner. For thicker softer rolls in the bread, roll thicker. It’s up to you and it tastes great either way. Mix the cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl and sprinkle over each loaf. Be generous. Roll up the loaves tightly and let rest for a few minutes before putting in the oven., Bake on a cookie sheet or baking stone for 30 minutes, or until it sounds hollow.

Use a dough whisk, spatula or your hands to combine the ingredients. Turn it out on a lightly-floured surface and knead or use a bench scraper to smooth the dough as much as possible using a kneading motion (using your hands) or by scooping the dough from the bottom and folding it over itself (using a bench scraper). Lightly coat in oil the surface of the bowl you used to mix the ingredients and return the dough to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for one hour (autolyse), Stretch and Fold, After the one hour autolyse, wet one of your hands (helps to prevent sticking), take one piece of the dough, stretch until the point of resistance then fold it over itself. Repeat this three to four times. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap again and wait 30 minutes for the next stretch and fold. Stretch and fold three times every thirty minutes over the course of one hour and a half. With each stretch and fold you will notice gluten development in the dough., Bulk Fermentation, After the stretch and fold session allow the dough to continue to proof until it's ready for shaping. In a warmer kitchen (about 75ºF when I baked this loaf) the remaining proof time after stretch and fold will be roughly one to two hours (with a healthy, robust starter). One way to check for readiness is the finger-dent test. Dip your finger in flour and poke the dough. If the dough is slow to spring back or doesn't spring back completely, it's ready for shaping. [A cooler kitchen (in the mid-60s to low 70s) will require a little longer proof time. If you start this process in early evening and you have a cool kitchen you can leave your dough overnight. You can also store it in the refrigerator overnight to slow the fermentation and continue with shaping the following morning.], Shaping and Final Proof (Please See Note Below), After bulk fermentation carefully turn the dough out on a lightly-floured surface. As you coax the dough out of the bowl the top surface will become the bottom once it's turned out on the work surface. You'll want to de-gas the dough a little and stretch it to a rectangle shape but rather than using a rolling pin take two edges of the dough and gently pull them apart without tearing the gluten strands. Pull taking two edges at a time until you have roughly a rectangle shape or large square. Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the entire top surface of the dough. Next, fold the wide part of the dough in thirds by taking one side and folding it two thirds of the way over then taking the other side and folding it over the already-folded side. Then roll the dough starting with one of the ends until you have a log. Pinch the seams. Spray a loaf pan with cooking spray or rub with oil and transfer the rolled dough seam side down. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to proof for one more hour. You should see a visible rise to the dough during this time., Bake, Preheat your oven to 425ºF. Make one slash along the length of the dough, off the side a little) then put it in the oven. Bake for 10 minutes then reduce the temperature to 400ºF. Bake for another 30-40 minutes or until the loaf is golden brown or the loaf registers 180ºF in the center.

Mix well until combined. Cover with a clean sack cloth towel or sprayed plastic wrap and wait about 20 minutes, or until the mixture has almost doubled in size and looks “sponge-like”.**(This wait time is OPTIONAL. I've learned the additional rest when I have the time yields just a slightly better crumb structure, but honestly, my mom skips the sponge (AND the first rise). She skips straight to the second rise and still has good results. So you can do that too! I'm just a strong critique when it comes to bread so opt for it when I have time.), Create Dough, Add 3 more cups of flour, salt, and butter to your sponge. It is normal for your sponge to “deflate” as you mix this together. Slowly incorporate the remaining flour in ½ cup increments. When the dough seems soft, not too sticky, and is gently pulling away from the sides of the bowl, it means you’ve added enough flour. Knead for 8-10 minutes. Add in 1 ½ - 2 cups of cinnamon chips during the last 2 minutes of kneading.If you are kneading by hand: when the dough mixture becomes more difficult to stir and work with in the bowl (usually at about 5 – 5 ½ cups) I like to work in the rest of the flour by hand. Place the dough on a clean, floured work surface. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and begin to knead. The quicker you work your hands, the less likely they are to stick. I like to knead by pulling in the corners of the dough with my fingers and then pressing down with heel of my hand, quickly and gently over and over again. While doing so, I continue to slowly add additional spoonfuls of flour. This will take about 10 minutes depending on how fast you knead. Add in 1 ½ - 2 cups of cinnamon chips during the last 2 minutes of kneading. You know the dough is ready when it’s not too sticky, and very soft., After kneading, round out the dough into a ball; doesn’t have to be perfect. Grease or flour the bottom of a bowl, place dough in bowl, and cover. Let rise about 25-30 minutes, or until doubled in size., Forming the Loaves, Grease two 9x5 inch pans. Punch down the risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. Gently work your dough into a thick rectangle (about 12x8) and fold into thirds. Roll it up, pinch the seams together, and gently throw your loaf on the work surface to release any last air bubbles. (There are many ways to form a loaf. Do what's comfortable and what works for you.), Place loaves in prepared pans, cover, and let rise again for about 30 minutes, or until the peak of the loaf is just arching over the rim of the pan. The dough should be soft and more airy. When you poke the dough, the mark should just barely slowly come back. If it bounces back immediately, it needs more proofing time.While dough rises, preheat oven to 350°F. (I like 375°F for high altitude), Bake, Bake for about 22-25 minutes or until bottoms are golden brown. If the tops are browning too quickly, but still needs time to cook, you can cover tops with aluminum foil to slow down the browning.Transfer loaves to a cooling rack and generously lather the tops with butter if desired while warm.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, o, n, e, y, ', ,,  , 0, ., 3, 3, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 7, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, i, n, n, a, m, o, n,  , c, h, i, p, s, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ]"

d61b44ba,https://www.thevanillabeanblog.com/circle-cinnamon-roll-bread-circle-toasting-bread/,Cinnamon Roll Circle Bread Recipe,2 pounds bread or brioche dough,"Grease the Almond Cake pans with pan spray. Take 2 pounds [910 g] of cold dough (the recipes have you chill the dough after the first rise to help with shaping) and shape it into a long rectangle, roughly the size of the pans (about 12 inches [30.5 cm]). Place the dough in one pan, and gently press it so the top is even, and so that it goes into the corners., Cover with the other Almond Cake Pan, and clip the two pans together with the metal clips. Place the pan on a sheet pan, and let rise. Rising time will vary on how cold your dough is, and how warm your kitchen is. I let mine rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the bottom of the pan no longer felt cool., A half hour before baking, preheat your oven to 350F [180C]., Place the sheet pan in the oven and let bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the dough registers 200F [95C] on an instant read thermometer. Note: I’ve been *carefully* removing the metal clips and top lid at about 35 minutes, and checking the temperature. If it is not at 200F [95C], I put it back in the oven with the top pan off and let it finish baking., Move the pan to a wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes, then turn the bread out onto the rack to finish cooling. Note: I turn my bread every 5 minutes or so while cooling to help it keep it’s circle shape – if it just lays on one side the entire time it will flatten a bit. Leaving it in the pan to cool the entire time will result in one soggy side., This bread is delicious the day of, and makes a *great* toasting bread. We cut the slices thin, toast the bread, and coat with butter and jam. Note: The white bread dough does ooze just the slightest bit from the sides in the first few minutes of baking (see photo below). It isn’t enough to ruin the bread or cause a huge mess (and the extra crispy edge comes right off when pressed), but I bake this bread on a half sheet pan just in case., For Cinnamon Roll Bread: Mix together 3/4 cup [150 g] brown sugar, 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, and a good pinch of salt. Roll the 2 pounds [910 g] of cold brioche dough out into a rectangle, about 12-inches by 12-inches [30.5 cm by 30.5 cm].

Stir in the cocoa powder., Slowly begin to incorporate the flour, one cup at a time, until a dough forms and no longer clings to the sides of the bowl. It should be soft and a bit sticky. Knead until the dough becomes smooth and elastic., Form the dough into a ball and place into a lightly greased bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a tea towel and let rest until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour., In a medium sized bowl, cream together the softened butter, brown sugar, and ground cinnamon., Gently deflate the dough.

With the fourth piece of dough, roll it out to a 10-inch circle but leave it plain. Do not spread any butter on top., Place a 3-inch biscuit butter or upside down drinking glass in the center of the layered dough as a guide.

Remove the biscuit cutter., Taking two side by side cut pieces of dough and turn them away from each other about 3 times, exposing the layers of cinnamon sugar inside. Pinch the ends together like a star tip. If they are having trouble sticking, brush them with a bit of water. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough until you have 8 star points., Move the piece of parchment paper onto a large baking sheet by sliding it. Do not lift it, or it may break. Cover the star with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let puff or nearly double in size, about 30-40 minutes., Preheat the oven to 350° F. Bake the star for 25-30 minutes or until it is a deep chocolate brown and the inside is fully cooked. You can check this by separating the layers gently with a paring knife and seeing if it is no longer doughy., Move the star to a wire cooling rack and let cool 15 minutes before icing., In a small bowl, make the icing.

a571a565,https://www.aboulderkitchen.com/recipe/some-dense-ass-bread/,Some Dense-Ass Bread,"1 1/2 cups water, lukewarm, 1 package active, dry yeast (approximately 2 1/4 teaspoons), 3 cups flour (white, whole wheat, spelt, rye, etc.) (Divided however you wish...the ratio is not as important), 2 teaspoons ancient sea salt, 1/2 cup ground flax seed (if you don't grind your flax it will just pass through the body unabsorbed), 1/2 cup millet, 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds, 1/2 cup hemp seeds, 1/2 cup sunflower seeds, 1/2 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped, 1/4 cup chia seeds, 1/4 cup sesame seeds","First toast all of your nuts and seeds lightly in a large heavy skillet. Keep an eye on them so they don't burn, but toast long enough that you can begin to smell their oils releasing. Let cool to room temperature before adding to the flour mixture., Using a heavy-duty mixer, add flours and salt to the mixing bowl. With the motor running slowly, add your lukewarm (not hot or you will kill the yeast) water and yeast. (No need to proof your yeast unless you think it's super old, in which case you should just go buy new yeast.), Next add your toasted, but cooled seeds and nuts. Be sure that they really are cool and not hot because otherwise you risk the heat destroying the yeast. Mix., The dough is going to be wet and dense. Sometimes if you use all whole wheat, it will be super dry so you'll have to add more water. In general, your dough won't pull together in a ball after you knead it but will remain quite squishy and moist--all of which is totally fine!, After you have mixed the bread for about 5-7 minutes on a low speed, cover the bowl with a towel or put a plate on top and let sit in a warm place to rise for about 1-2 hours. It's likely not going to rise a ton because of the weight of the ingredients, but it should rise some., After it rises, punch the dough down and place in a lightly greased bread loaf pan. Cover and let rise again for another hour or so. Sometimes I even let the dough rise twice in the bowl and then put in my greased loaf pan. Remember --this bread is very forgiving., About 15 minutes before you are ready to bake, preheat your oven to 350 degrees., Bake your bread for approximately 45 minutes to an hour. Because it's so heavy, I do use an instant-read thermometer to test for doneness. It should read at about 190 degrees. You can also tap the bottom and if it sounds hollow, it should be cooked all the way through., Let cool completely -- about 30 minutes. Slice, toast and enjoy!","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', a, c, t, i, v, e,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, e, a,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, a, x,  , s, e, e, d, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, i, l, l, e, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, u, m, p, k, i, n,  , s, e, e, d, s, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, e, m, p,  , s, e, e, d, s, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, n, f, l, o, w, e, r,  , s, e, e, d, s, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, l, n, u, t, s, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, h, i, a,  , s, e, e, d, s, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, e, s, a, m, e,  , s, e, e, d, s, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ]"

Finally, roll out the last ball of dough and place on top of the others. The top dough circle is to be left bare., Place a small glass bowl or cup (2 inches in diameter) in the center of the dough to mark the center. Starting at the top center of the dough (12 o'clock position), cut the dough from the point of the bowl to the outer edge of the dough with a sharp knife being careful not to cut underneath the glass bowl at the center. Then cut the dough directly underneath the top portion already cut from the bowl to the edge of the dough (6 o'clock position). Repeat this at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions. Cut through each quarter of dough like previously to form 8 equal sections. Cut through the middle of all 8 wedges again to form 16 equal sections., Take the glass bowl off the center of the dough.

Let the yeast stand for a few minutes to proof it until you see that it is foamy (aka alive and working)., Mix in the remaining honey, molasses, olive oil and eggs. With the dough hook attachment or with a wooden spoon (if you're mixing by hand) slowly add in the salt and flour and mix until the dough forms a ball. Knead for 5 to 8 minutes (by hand or with the stand mixer dough hook)., Transfer the dough to an olive-oil coated bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for 1 hour or until almost doubled in size., for the filling, Melt butter then add in the sugars, spices, salt,and molasses. Set aside, forming and braiding the challah, Divide the dough into three even balls. Set two aside and roll out the first into a large round circle (10-12 inch diameter). This doesn't have to be perfect. Spread out 1/3 of the ginger/cinnamon filling onto the circle and then roll the circle into a long, tight rope, trapping the filling within. Gently stretch the rope by squeezing it and holding it vertically, letting its own weight stretch it. Repeat with remaining two dough balls., On a parchment covered baking sheet, lay out all three long ropes side by side. Pinch together all three ropes at one end. Then braid the ropes just as you would normally braid anything. Once you're at the end of the ropes, fold the end under and pinch to seal.

Add the caraway seeds, if using. Make a well in the center then add the water into the well. Mix, incorporating the water into the flour until you have a very sticky shaggy dough (if the dough seems to dry, add a little more water). Cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit in a warm place for 3 hours., Heat the oven to 450º F. Place your enamel Dutch oven and its cover (I used the oval oven, as long as it’s enamel, the bread will NOT stick) in the oven and heat for 30 minutes., While the “oven” is heating in the oven; scrape the very sticky dough out onto a well-floured counter with your very well-floured fingers (did I mention the dough is sticky?, well it is). Fold over a few times then form into a ball, sealing the bottom into a seam as best you can. Cover with plastic while you wait for the pot to get hot. Once the pot AND its cover have been in for 30 minutes, CAREFULLY remove, open and drop your ball of dough into the center; cover and return to the oven. Cook for 30 minutes; uncover and cook 10 – 15 minutes more, or until the internal temperature reaches 200 degrees when read with an instant-read thermometer.

e67eb7c9,https://www.theflavorbender.com/homemade-white-bread-recipe/,Homemade Bread (Homemade White Bread),"2 ¼ tsp active dry yeast (7 g), 1 cup lukewarm water, 1 tbsp honey ((or sugar or maple syrup)), Proofed yeast mixture ((ingredients listed above)), 19.5 ounces AP flour (4 ⅓ cups, spoon and leveled (please see notes)), ½ cup lukewarm water (Scant 1 cup), 1 ¼ tsp sea salt, 2 tbsp honey, ¼ tsp citric acid (or ½ tbsp white vinegar (optional)), 2 tbsp unsalted butter (melted (or vegetable oil))","Proofing yeast, Place the water in the mixer bowl of your stand mixer., Stir in the honey to dissolve, and sprinkle the yeast over the water. Gently stir to mix., Allow the yeast to sit in a warm place for about 15 minutes, until it's activated and becomes frothy. This could take longer if your yeast was in the freezer. If the yeast doesn't activate (no frothy bubbles), then your yeast is likely too old and you will need it replaced with fresh yeast., Once the yeast is activated, you’re ready to make the bread dough., Bread loaf, To the proofed yeast mixture, add the flour, warm water, salt, honey, citric acid and melted butter., Using a dough whisk or a spatula, mix the ingredients to form a rough dough., Place the bowl in the mixer with a kneading hook attached, and knead the dough on low speed for about 2 - 5 minutes, until the dough comes together to form a ball., Increase the speed by 1 or 2 levels (speed 3 or 4 in a kitchen aid mixer) and knead the dough for a further 12 - 15 minutes until it's smooth and elastic., While the dough is kneading, check on it every few minutes to make sure it’s kneading well, and is not too dry or too wet. The dough is going to be very sticky and wet at the beginning, and become smoother as it's kneaded., To check if the dough has the right consistency after about 10 minutes of kneading - Increase the speed of the mixer to about 5 or 6 just for a minute or two. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, then it’s too wet, so add a little extra flour (a dusting at a time), to get the right texture. If the dough is still tacky but is coming off the sides (mostly), and only sticking to the bottom of the bowl, then it's at the right consistency. When you stop the mixer and lift the kneading hook from the bowl, and the dough isn’t sticking to the bottom of the bowl, then the dough might be too dry. You may need to add a little extra water (just ½ tsp at a time), to get the right consistency. The dough should be smooth, a little soft and tacky to the touch., Once the dough is kneaded, remove the dough hook and fold the dough over a few times by hand, to get a smooth ball. Then place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough proof for about 1 hour until it has at least doubled in size., While the dough is proofing, prepare the bread loaf pans. Butter 1 - 9 x 5 inch loaf pan for a very large loaf, or 2 - 8.5 x 4.5 inch loaf pans for smaller loaves, and set aside until the dough is ready., Turn the proofed dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Slightly flatten is with your hands. If making two smaller loaves, halve the dough with a sharp knife or bench scraper. (For more accurately halved dough, weigh the dough and then split it evenly by weight.) Place one portion of the dough back in the bowl and place it in the fridge while you shape the first portion., Gently press the dough into an evenly thick rectangle. The short side of this rectangle should be roughly about 8 - 8.5 inches (i.e. slightly shorter than the length of your bread loaf pan)., Next, tightly roll up the short side, along the length of the dough rectangle. Make sure to pinch / press the edge of the dough as you go, while rolling it up (read the post and see pictures for more details)., Once the dough is rolled up, pinch the seams to seal it, and tuck in the two sides and pinch these seams as well. Make sure all the seams are on one side (this will be the bottom) and the other side is smooth and seam-free (this will be the top)., Transfer this into the prepared loaf pan, seam side down, and press the dough into the pan. Make sure it’s evenly pressed into the bottom of the pan. Loosely cover the loaf pan with plastic wrap and let it proof again in a warm place, for about 45 minutes - 1 hour. The dough should double in size inside the loaf pan / pans., Repeat with the second portion of dough (if making two smaller loaves)., To check if it has proofed enough, gently press the top of the dough with your finger to leave an indentation that is about ½ cm deep. If proofed properly, this indentation should remain, or only bounce back slightly. If it bounces back almost completely, then it's underproofed. (Read the post and see pictures for more details.), Preheat the oven (conventional oven) to 375°F / 190°C, during the last 30 minutes of the second proofing time. It’s best for the oven to be preheated to the right temperature for at least 20 minutes before baking the bread., When the bread loaf is ready and the oven has preheated, place the loaf pans in the middle of the oven, and bake for 35 - 45 minutes. Make sure there is at least 2 inches of space between the pans to allow for proper air circulation. The bread is done when it sounds hollow when tapped on top, OR when the internal temperature reaches 195°F / 91°C., Remove the pans from the oven and keep in a warm place (away from drafts) to cool. After about 10 minutes, remove the bread from the pans and keep it on a wire rack to cool down completely. The bread is now ready to be served., Optional - brush melted butter on top while it's hot to add more buttery flavor., Keep the loaf (or loaves) in a bread box at room temperature for up to 4 - 5 days, or slice and keep in the freezer for up to 1 month.","[, (, ', a, c, t, i, v, e,  , d, r, y,  , y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 7, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, o, n, e, y, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', a, p,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, 9, ., 5, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, e, a,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, o, n, e, y, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, i, t, r, i, c,  , a, c, i, d, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ]"

Line a 9×5-inch or 10×5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper. Grease the inside ends of the pan if they are exposed. If you only have an 8.5×4.5-inch loaf pan, prepare it along with another small vessel with parchment paper — do not be tempted to bake the entire batter in it as it will overflow., Cream the butter and sugar, either with a wooden spoon or with an electric hand-held mixer, being sure not to overbeat it., Meanwhile, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside., Add the eggs and vanilla to the butter-sugar mixture and beat until combined., Next, fold in the melted and now slightly cooled chocolate, taking care to blend well but being careful not to overbeat. You want the ingredients combined: You don’t want a light, airy mass. Add the brandy and coffee mix to combine., Finally, add the flour mixture and mix only until the flour is absorbed. The batter should be smooth and fairly liquidy., Pour into the lined loaf pan, being sure the batter does not come closer than 1 inch from the rim of the cake pan or it risks overflowing. Bake for 30 minutes. Turn the oven down to 325ºF and continue to cook for another 15 to 20 minutes more. (If baking some of the batter in a small pan, remove after the first 30 minutes.) Remove the pan from the oven. The cake will still be a bit squidgy inside, so an inserted cake tester or skewer won’t come out completely clean. Place the loaf pan on a rack, and leave it to get completely cold before turning it out. (Leave it for a whole day if you can resist.)

It should be bubbly., The Dough: Add the 2 cups water, 2 cups whole wheat flour, dry milk, wheat gluten, salt, sugar and oil. Mix until combined., Here’s where you learn how to make bread. Start to add your remaining flour. I add one cup at a time but you can do it by the half a cup. 2 cups might be enough but it could go up to 4 cups. Fully incorporate the flour you add before adding more., Whole wheat bread will still be a little sticky and a little stiff, carefully judge when you think you have enough. Once you make bread enough you’ll know when it’s enough flour. You can always add more flour when you're kneading., Kneading: By hand, 20 to 30 minutes. In a mixer, 10 minutes. I suggest the bread mixer. The first time I made this I did it by hand. Because whole wheat is heavier I could only last about 2 minutes. I baked it but this was not a light textured bread. The second time I did it for 10 in my mixer… wow what a difference., Rising: Once your dough is kneaded your going to coat it all over in a little oil and stick it in a bowl that will let it rise at least one and a half times it’s size. Now you’re going to cover it with plastic wrap and a towel, put it in a warm place and let it rise for 45 minutes to an hour. It should have risen over double it’s size., During this rising time you want to spray or butter two bread pans. I use Pyrex 9”x5”., Shaping, Last Rise, and Baking: When your dough is ready dump it out and push the bubbles out of it. Divide it as equal as you can. Flatten each piece out to a rectangle about the size of the pan then roll it up tight and pinch the seams together tucking the ends inches Turn over and put in the pan seam side down., Put the loaves in a warm place and cover with a towel, let them rise from 30 minutes to an hour. You want your loaves to be at least 2 inches over the top of the pan, nice and high, they won't rise anymore in the oven. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. Bake for 15 minutes then lower the heat to 350 and cook for another 20 minutes. They will be a deep brown., Take them out and remove them from their pans and cool on a cooling rack.

Lowering the oven rack prevents the top of your bread from browning too much, too soon. Grease a metal 9×5-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray. Set aside., Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. Set aside., Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. With the mixer running on medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then beat in the yogurt, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract until combined., With the mixer running on low speed, slowly beat the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until no flour pockets remain. Do not over-mix. Fold in the nuts, if using., Pour and spread the batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 60–65 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent the top from getting too brown. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with only a few small moist crumbs. This may be after 60–65 minutes depending on your oven, so begin checking every 5 minutes around the 60-minute mark., Remove bread from the oven and allow the bread to cool in the pan set on a wire rack for 1 hour.

Mix well until combined. Cover with a clean sack cloth towel or sprayed plastic wrap and wait about 20 minutes, or until the mixture has almost doubled in size and looks “sponge-like”., Create Dough, Add the vital wheat gluten, 1 more cup of flour, salt, and butter (or oil) to your sponge. It is normal for your sponge to “deflate” as you mix this together. Slowly incorporate the remaining flour in ½ cup increments. When the dough seems soft, not too sticky, and is gently pulling away from the sides of the bowl, it means you’ve added enough flour. Knead for 10 minutes., If you are kneading by hand: when the dough mixture becomes more difficult to stir and work with in the bowl (usually at about 5 – 5 ½ cups). I like to work in the rest of the flour by hand. Place the dough on a clean, floured work surface. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and begin to knead. The quicker you work your hands, the less likely they are to stick. I like to knead by pulling in the corners of the dough with my fingers and then pressing down with heel of my hand, quickly and gently over and over again. While doing so, I continue to slowly add additional spoonfuls of flour. This will take about 10 minutes depending on how fast you knead. You know the dough is ready when it’s not too sticky, and very soft., After kneading, round out the dough into a circle; doesn’t have to be perfect. Grease or flour the bottom of a bowl, place dough in bowl, and cover. Let rise about 25-30 minutes, or until doubled in size., Forming the Loaves, Grease two 9x5 inch pans. Punch down the risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. Gently work your dough into a thick rectangle (about 12x8)and fold into thirds. Roll it up, pinch the seams together, and gently throw your loaf on the work surface to release any last air bubbles. (There are many ways to form a loaf. Do what's comfortable and what works for you.), Place loaves in prepared pans, cover, and let rise again for about 25 minutes, or until thepeak of the loaf is just arching over the rim of the pan., While dough rises, preheat oven to 350°(I like 375°F for high altitude)., Bake, Bake for about 25 minutes or until bottoms are golden brown. If the tops are browning too quickly, but still needs time to cook, you can cover tops with aluminum foil to slow down the browning., Transfer loaves to a cooling rack and generously lather the tops with butter while warm.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, b, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, o, n, e, y, ', ,,  , 0, ., 3, 3, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 6, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, h, e, a, t,  , g, l, u, t, e, n, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, ', ), ]"
6423d086,https://www.potluckiest.com/challah/,"Light, Fluffy, Perfectly Chewy Challah","240 g warm water (105-115°), 13 g instant yeast (see note about yeast quantity and type), 125 g vegetable oil (see note about substituting butter), 165 g honey, 28 g salt, 6 large eggs, 1000 g bread flour (can substitute all-purpose flour), toppings (optional) (poppy seeds, sesame seeds, everything bagel topping, etc.), 1 large egg","Mixing the dough, Combine warm (105-115°) water with yeast in a medium bowl. Set aside for five minutes., Add oil and honey and stir to combine., Beat 4 whole eggs plus 2 egg yolks in a separate bowl (discard or save the leftover egg whites for another purpose)., Add the eggs and salt to the liquid mixture and stir to combine completely., Kneading the dough with a stand mixer, Add 930g of the flour to the bowl of the mixer, then add the liquid mixture to the flour. Reserve the remaining 70g flour. Attach the dough hook and lock the mixer head in the down position. Start the mixer on its lowest speed to combine the ingredients., Once all the flour has been incorporated, increase the mixer speed to medium-low to knead and run it for about 7-8 minutes. If you see a lot of dough sticking to the sides, add in 1 tbsp of the reserved flour and let it become fully incorporated. You may need to do this 3 or 4 more times during this step., After 8 minutes, stop the mixer and use a flexible dough scraper (silicone spatula is fine too) to scrape down the sides of the bowl. The dough should be tacky but not impossibly sticky at this point; if it is impossibly sticky (i.e., you can't rub your hands together and get the dough completely off your fingers), add another tbsp of the reserved flour to the bowl and knead another minute or two., Test the dough strength with the windowpane test: tear off a chunk of dough approximately 2 tbsp in size. Hold the piece of dough up to a window or light, and, using your fingers, pinch and stretch the dough into as thin and flat a shape as you can. If you can stretch the dough so that light comes through the dough without the dough tearing, the dough is ready for its first rise. If the windowpane tears, return the dough to the ball and knead for another minute or two and test again. Note: the dough probably doesn't need any more flour at this point, just more kneading., Depending on the size of your mixer, you may find as the dough nears completion, it may start creeping over the top of the dough hook. If that's the case, it's best to pull it out of the mixer and complete by hand. Use the dough scraper to release the dough from the bowl and hook and transfer to countertop to knead by hand. The dough may seem very sticky coming out of the bowl, but use the dough scraper to release the dough from the countertop, adding a little flour only when absolutely necessary. As you knead by hand, some dough may stick to the countertop as you pick up the dough and rotate it. If it's a very small amount of dough, scrape it up with the dough scraper and continue kneading. If a lot of dough is staying on the countertop, add 1 tbsp of the reserved flour and knead it in. The dough will become less sticky as it gains strength., Once the dough passes the windowpane test and is not overly sticky, skip to ""Rising the dough"" below., Kneading the dough by hand, Add 930g flour to a large mixing bowl, then add the liquid mixture and stir with a mixing spoon or dough whisk to mix thoroughly. Reserve the remaining 70g flour., It can be easier to start the kneading right in the bowl, but you can also turn out the mixture onto a countertop dusted with 1 tbsp of the reserved flour. Your goal is to use as little of the reserved flour as possible. The dough will become less sticky on its own as it gains strength., Kneading technique: Gather into a ball and flatten. Pull the top of the flattened ball and fold over the bottom, then use the heel of your hand to seal the fold. Pick up the dough, turn it 90 degrees, and repeat the process. If it's too difficult to pick up the dough cleanly from the counter with your hands, use a flexible plastic dough scraper to pick it up, and sprinkle 1 tbsp of the reserved flour in the bowl or on the countertop, and return the dough and knead until incorporated. Knead for about 8-10 minutes., At this point the dough should be tacky but not impossibly sticky — you should be able to rub your hands together and get all the dough off cleanly. If not, add 1 tbsp of the reserved flour and knead another 1-2 minutes., Test the dough strength with the windowpane test: tear off a chunk of dough approximately 2 tbsp in size. Hold the piece of dough up to a window or light, and, using your fingers, pinch and stretch the dough into as thin and flat a shape as you can. If you can stretch the dough so that light comes through the dough without the dough tearing, the dough is ready for its first rise (skip to ""Rising the dough"" below). If the windowpane tears, return the dough to the ball and knead for another minute or two and test again. Note: the dough probably doesn't need any more flour at this point, just more kneading., Rising the dough, Oil a large mixing bowl or food-safe tub (with a tight-fitting lid)., Form the dough into a tight ball, pulling gently down at the sides so that the dough is taut, and pinch underneath to seal., Place the ball of dough in the bowl or tub, turning to coat all sides in the oil, then cover (for a bowl, use plastic wrap or a kitchen towel; for a food-safe tub, use the tight-fitting lid)., Set aside in a warm (80-100°F), draft-free spot and let rise until doubled in size. Because of the lower amount of yeast compared to other recipes, the first rise will likely take significantly longer than other recipes might indicate (see note about yeast types and rising times). In a spot that's about 80°, the first rise can take about 2.5-3 hours. A spot that's closer to 90-100° will rise more quickly. Don't put the dough in an environment hotter than that., When the dough has completed its first rise, take the dough out of the bowl or tub (it probably will not come out completely cleanly; that's a good thing, just scrape it all together) and deflate it, reshaping into a tight ball as before and returning to the bowl or tub and cover for its second rise, which should take about 1/3 the time of the initial rise. When the dough has once again doubled in volume, the second rise is done. (Note: many bakers opt to skip this step, but I find the difference in quality to be worth the extra time and tiny effort.), Shaping, Challah is known for being a braided loaf. There are countless ways to braid a loaf; in this recipe I'll explain how to create the six-strand braid seen in the photo., Have a kitchen scale, dough scraper, and rolling pin on hand. Line two half-sheet pans with one piece of parchment or a silicone baking mat each. It's best to bake each loaf individually for the deepest color and an even doneness., Weigh the completed dough, which should be approximately 1800g. Divide in half and set aside one of the halves (each half makes one challah)., Working the first half, divide the dough into six equal pieces. Use the kitchen scale to measure precisely (tip: weigh in grams for easier math). It's perfectly ok to tear off little chunks to move between pieces to achieve pieces of equal weight. Once you've separated the dough into six equal pieces, form each into a tight ball, again stretching the sides down and pinching on the bottom., Making the ropes: Start with the first of the six balls you created, flip it over so the bottom of the ball is showing, and flatten the ball evenly on the countertop. You should not need any additional flour at this point — if your dough passed the windowpane test earlier, it should be strong enough to release from the countertop easily but also stick just enough to do the work you need to do.Using the rolling pin and starting from the center, roll up and down until you have a very flat (1/4"" thick) elongated oval. Use the heel of your hand to flatten the corners so if forms an evenly flat rectangle.Roll the rectangle tightly up on the long side to form a cigar shape. Roll the rope back and forth, pressing a little heavier on each end until you have a long, even rope about 1 inch/3cm thick with tapered ends. Pinch the seam shut, roll the rope a few more times to help the seal tighten, and set the rope aside, seam side down, while you complete the remaining ropes., Once all the ropes are done, the first ones will likely have contracted and thickened a little, and the seam may have reopened. Just pinch it shut again. Gently roll the ropes to lengthen them out again and make them even with each other, approximately an inch in diameter and 15 inches long. It's important to roll gently but assertively—you don't want to rip the strands of gluten. Finish each rope by tapering about an inch on each end even more, to about 1/4"" diameter., Creating a six-strand braid: Clear a large countertop or work surface. Arrange the ropes, seam side down, like the diagram here, where it looks like a stick figure with no head, two arms, and four legs. Pinch all ropes together at the top middle spot. Keep the seam sides down as you do the braid.Take the left arm (A) and swing it down just to the left of the inside right leg (D). This rope becomes the new D. Now move the outside right leg (E) up to become the new right arm (A). Repeat on the left: bring the right arm (F) down just to the left of the inside left leg (C). This is now the new C. Move the outside left leg (B) up to become the new right arm (F). Repeat, starting with A as before. When you can't braid further, pinch the bottom ends tightly together and tuck underneath the loaf. The top ends were already pinched when you began. Pinch again and tuck underneath the loaf, pinching underneath to seal the tucked end to the underside., Move the finished loaf to one of the parchment-lined half-sheet pans and cover with plastic wrap., Wait 10-15 minutes, then shape the second loaf and set aside on the second parchment-lined half-sheet pan and cover with plastic wrap., Final rise, Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until it has become large and puffy, about 50% larger in volume. Check the rise every 30 minutes or so. This may take two hours even in a warm kitchen with this recipe. It's important to complete this final rise; otherwise the braids may pull apart too much in baking. (But also don't overproof, which can lead to flatter finished results.) The more you do this, the better sense you'll have of how long this process takes in your kitchen and you can leave it alone longer., In the last half hour of the final rise, preheat the oven to 350°F., Make the egg wash: beat the remaining egg in a small dish along with 1 teaspoon of water until it has a very even consistency. Just before baking, brush the egg wash all over the loaf, making sure there are no dry spots. Save the egg wash, as you'll be reapplying it during the bake., Baking and cooling, Bake in the center of the oven for 15 minutes, then take out and apply another egg wash., Optional: at this point you can add toppings such as poppy seeds, sesame seeds, everything bagel seasoning, etc. Sprinkle over the loaf after the egg wash., Return to the oven and bake another 15-20 minutes, until the top is deeply golden and an instant-read thermometer registers 190-200° in the thickest part. Another way to check doneness is to flip the loaf over and thump it with the back of a spoon. If it makes a hollow sound, the loaf is probably ready to take out of the oven. Slide off the parchment onto a cooling rack and let cool for at least an hour. It doesn't need to be completely cool before you slice into it, but it does finish its baking during that first hour of cooling., After the bread is completely cool, you can store it in a plastic bag for 3-4 days. For the prettiest slices, slice diagonally across the bumps.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, 4, 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, 3, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', v, e, g, e, t, a, b, l, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 1, 2, 5, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, o, n, e, y, ', ,,  , 1, 6, 5, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, 8, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, s, ', ,,  , 6, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, 0, 0, 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', t, o, p, p, i, n, g, s, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, ', ,,  , 1, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ]"
6ab8c9e9,https://thedessertedgirl.com/2020/11/03/dense-chocolate-cake/,Dense Chocolate Loaf,"1 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (180 gms), 2 tbsps cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1/4 tsp salt, if using unsalted butter, 200 gms dark cooking chocolate, finely chopped (see notes), 200 gms butter at room temp, 1 and 1/3 cups brown sugar (280 gms) (see notes), 1/4 cup thick yoghurt or curd (55 gms), 2 eggs at room temperature (see notes) (), 2 tsps vanilla extract, 1 cup freshly boiled water (250 ml)","In a bowl, sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt. Set aside., Melt the chocolate in the microwave (5-second increments, stirring in between) or in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, and set aside to cool a little., In the meantime, line a 9x5 loaf tin with non-stick baking paper, leaving a little overhang for easy removal. This cake is moist and fragile and the paper makes it easier to take the cake out without breaking it. Preheat the oven to 175 C (See notes)., In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar with a hand mixer till pale and light. Add the yoghurt and beat gently to combine., Add the vanilla and the eggs, one at a time, beating gently after each addition., Now stir in the melted chocolate by hand, taking care not to be too vigorous, and mixing until just incorporated., Finally, add the flour mixture and the boiling water, alternately, one spoon at a time. This step will feel a little slow, but it's important because adding the water and flour too suddenly causes lumps. Use a silicone spatula to gently stir the batter with each addition, again take care not to overbeat it., If you still see lumps (I do, despite my best efforts), beat with the hand mixer on low speed until smooth. The batter is quite runny., Pour the batter into the prepared loaf tin and bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until the cake has risen (it will dome and crack a bit, see notes), and a toothpick poked in the center comes out clean. If you feel the top is darkening too fast, cover very loosely with foil and continue baking. Because ovens vary, it's a good idea to check around 45 minutes and then add more baking time as needed, but avoid opening the oven before this., Once baked, let the cake cool COMPLETELY at room temperature. Do not attempt to take it out of the tin as it's definitely a fragile cake. To make things easier, you can also chill it for 30 minutes before slicing. You'll get 8 to 10 large slices but I prefer to slice each one in half further for more manageable servings!, Store the cake at room temperature for 2 to 3 days and in the fridge for 10 days and in the freezer for longer. In humid weather, I usually store the slices in an airtight tin and place it in the fridge on day two itself as the cake is already very soft and moist. When you want to eat, lightly reheat the slices or let them come to room temperature.

Let sit for 5 minutes, until it dissolves- if you're not sure of its age, make sure it gets foamy. (If the yeast doesn't do anything, toss it out and buy fresh yeast.), Add the rest of the water and about half of the flour. Stir until well blended. Add the rest of the flour, the salt and butter and stir with the dough hook (or by hand) until well combined and shaggy. Continue to knead (I let the dough hook go for about 8 minutes, poking it down once in awhile) until it's smooth and elastic. (You could do this by hand, too.) If you used the dough hook, turn the dough out onto the countertop and knead a few times to make sure it's evenly smooth. Doesn't it feel great?, Shape it into a ball and put it back into the bowl. Cover with a tea towel and let it sit for 1 - 1 1/2 hours, until it's doubled in size., Butter two 9x5-inch loaf pans, or line them with parchment. Punch the dough down (love that part!) and pat each piece into a rectangle that's about 9x12 inches - or a bit bigger than a standard piece of paper., Starting at a short end, fold it in thirds, like a letter. Place seam side down in the loaf pans, tucking the ends in. Cover with the tea towel again and leave them for an hour, until they puff right up out of the pan. As it rises, preheat the oven to 375°F, with the rack in the middle of the oven., If you like, brush the tops of the loaves with milk before baking. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until the loaves are honey brown. Immediately turn the loaves out of their pans and onto a rack to cool.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 6, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ]"

(You can do this by hand if you prefer.) Then add the yeast mixture along with the buttermilk and beer. Attach the dough hook and knead on the bread setting (#2) for 10 minutes. Scoop the batter into a large non-reactive bowl, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let it sit at room temperature for at least 8 hours, preferably longer, up to 24 hours (the longer the better for the whole grain berries to soften and for heightened sourdough properties. Also the longer it ferments the more liquid will be absorbed so less chances of a moist center after baking.), Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F., Scoop the batter (it will be thick and gooey but not like regular bread dough) into a generously buttered 13x4x4 Pullman loaf pan and smooth the top to even it out. Sprinkle with oats. (Note: Baking this bread in a Pullman loaf pan yields those nice small, square slices of bread. But it also helps ensure that the center of the bread is fully cooked.) I always bake this without the lid on., Bake on the middle rack for 100-120 minutes or until the center is done. For best and most accurate results use an instant read thermometer and aim for 210 degrees F. Let the bread sit in the pan for 5 minutes before removing it, then let it cool completely on a wire rack before slicing it. To get clean, professional slices I highly recommend using a bread slicer.","[, ', (, e, i, n, k, o, r, n,  , f, l, o, u, r, ,,  , 4, ., 5, ,,  , c, u, p, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, e, i, n, k, o, r, n,  , b, e, r, r, i, e, s, ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , c, u, p, ), ', ,,  , ', (, e, i, n, k, o, r, n,  , b, e, r, r, i, e, s, ,,  , 1, ., 7, 5, ,,  , c, u, p, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, f, l, a, x,  , s, e, e, d, s, ,,  , 1, ,,  , c, u, p, ), ', ,,  , ', (, s, u, n, f, l, o, w, e, r,  , s, e, e, d, s, ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , c, u, p, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, s, e, s, a, m, e,  , s, e, e, d, s, ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , c, u, p, ), ', ,,  , ', (, s, a, l, t, ,,  , 3, ,,  , t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, d, r, y,  , a, c, t, i, v, e,  , y, e, a, s, t, ,,  , 2, ,,  , t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, s, u, g, a, r, ,,  , 2, ,,  , t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, w, a, t, e, r, ,,  , 2, ,,  , c, u, p, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, b, u, t, t, e, r, m, i, l, k, ,,  , 2, ,,  , c, u, p, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, b, e, e, r, ,,  , 1, ,,  , c, u, p, ), ', ]"

Combine in a bowl, cover and leave to ripen for 16 - 24 hours., Prepare the scalded rye. Pour the boiling water over the rye grains and leave overnight., Prepare the rye soaker. Combine in a bowl, cover and leave overnight., Day 2 (Sunday), 11.30am - Add one litre of water to the scalded rye soaker, bring to a boil and simmer for approx. 1 hour until soft., 12.30pm - Strain the rye and discard any remaining water. Set aside to cool., 1pm - In a large bowl combine 700g of sourdough (the rest goes back into the fridge for your next bake), the cracked rye soaker, the cooked and cooled rye berries, the 550g extra cracked rye, the water (150g), salt (22g), maple syrup (120g) and mix until the dough comes together well. Mix for a few minutes (I just do this with my hands). Once this is done, cover the bowl and leave to rest for 30 minutes.Note: The dough should not be wet. It should stick together well and not fall apart. It should peel off the side of the bowl easily and stick on a spoon when held up., 1.45pm - Oil a large and a small loaf tin (I use a silicone brush to do this), then place the dough into the baking tins. Again, just use your hands to do this and even out the dough surface across the tin. Fill the tins only half full. Cover the tins - if you are using Pullman forms, use the Pullman tin cover, otherwise use a polythene bag to ensure the dough doesn't dry out., 2pm - Leave to prove for 3 hours (depends on room temperature, so do keep an eye on the dough during this time).

If the dough shrinks back, let the dough rest for 20 minutes then come back and stretch it some more. Letting the dough rest relaxes the gluten and keeps it from shrinking. Keep doing this until you can get the dough all the way to the edges of the pan., Cover the pan with some plastic wrap and put it in the fridge overnight. The yeast will continue eating those sugars and rise very slowly. The next day, you should have some nice bubbles on top of the dough., Preheat your oven to 450ºF (232ºC) and take your dough out of the fridge., Use your fingers to pop the big bubbles and press dimples into the surface of the dough., Drizzle olive oil onto the top of the dough so that it settles in those dimples., Sprinkle a healthy amount of flakey sea salt and chopped rosemary on top of the dough., Bake the dough in a preheated oven (450ºF or 232ºC) on the middle rack for 25 minutes or until it’s golden brown!, Finally, brush the baked focaccia with more olive oil before serving.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, 6, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 7, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, i, l, ', ,,  , 2, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 2, 4, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, i, l, ', ,,  , 4, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', r, o, s, e, m, a, r, y, ', ,,  , 2, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ]"

If the yeast doesn't activate, try again., In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the cocoa, coffee, molasses, caraway, butter, and salt. Stir constantly until just melted. You want the mixture to be lukewarm when you add it to the other of the ingredients., Combine the yeast mixture with the grated carrot and molasses mixture in a large mixing bowl. Add the flours, and stir until you've got a soft, tacky, cohesive dough. If you'r dough is too dry, add more of the warm water a bit at a time. Alternately, if your dough is a bit too wet, and you need to add a bit more flour, do so. Turn the dough out onto your counter and knead for about 5 minutes, or until the dough is elastic and springy. Note: you can do this step using the dough hook on your mixer., Shape the dough into a ball, rub with a bit of olive oil, and place seam-side down into an oiled bowl. Cover and allow to rise in a warm, cozy place for 1- 2 hours or until the dough increases in size by at least half. At this point, gently press down, with a closed fist, across the surface of the dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter, and coerce into a pleasant-shaped round. Place directly on a very lightly oiled baking sheet, then cover loosely with a floured tea cloth or plastic wrap. Allow to rise in a warm place until nearly doubled in size, another hour. Uncover, brush gently with buttermilk, sprinkle with a dusting of flour, ~1 teaspoon caraway seeds, and use a serrated knife to slash an 'X' deeply across the dough (do your best not to deflate the loaf)., Bake for 20 minutes at 425F / 220C.

Arrange a rack in the bottom third of the oven. Line a 9x5-inch (23x13 cm) loaf pan with parchment paper, letting the excess hang over the long sides to form a sling., Pour the aquafaba into a medium bowl. Using a handheld electric mixer, whip the aquafaba on medium speed for 45-60 seconds until uniformly foamy., Wipe out the bowl used for the aquafaba. Add the three bananas to the bowl and mash with a fork until smooth and no lumps remain (or, for a more rustic banana bread, leave a few chunks in). FYI: the 3 mashed bananas should weigh around 300g., Stir the lemon juice into the oat milk and set aside. This is the vegan ""buttermilk."", In a large mixing bowl, add the sugar and oil. Mix using the electric mixer or a whisk until well combined., Add the whipped aquafaba and mix until well incorporated. Add in the vegan ""buttermilk"" and vanilla and mix until smooth. Add the mashed bananas and mix until well incorporated., Add the flour, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon to the wet ingredients. Switch to using a silicone spatula (if you don’t have one, use a large wooden spoon). Gently stir until the ingredients are just barely combined. It’s okay if you can see a few traces of flour., Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth out the top of the batter using a spatula or spoon., For the optional decoration, keep the peel on the reserved banana and slice it in half, lengthwise; then peel the banana. Sprinkle a little coconut sugar or brown sugar on the cut/interior sides of the banana. Gently arrange the bananas on top the batter, sugared side side up.NOTE: This might create a dome in the middle of the bananas, where the batter bunches up in the middle. Use a spoon to move some of the batter around the pan so that the bread doesn’t bake unevenly., Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes. Since every home oven differs, I like to start checking at 45 minutes. The banana bread is done when a toothpick inserted into the center top at a slight angle comes out a few moist crumbs (see Note 5). If there's runny batter, it needs more time., Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool for 10 minutes. Then remove the bread from the pan and cool on the rack for at least 20 to 30 minutes before slicing (the bread is still cooking and setting up, so don't slice too early)., To store, place completely cooled banana bread in an airtight container or wrap tightly in plastic and leave on the counter for 2-4 days (if using decorative banana topping, the topping a will start to brown after day 1). You can also freeze the banana bread. If you freeze the whole loaf, allow it to defrost on the countertop for 2-3 hours.

Make the dough/autolyse (~30 mins)In a large bowl, combine the preferment with 400ml water and 500g of bread flour, 50g of whole wheat flour, and 50g spelt flour (or whatever flours you are using). Mix just until all the flour has been hydrated (using another splash or two of water, if needed). Cover with plastic and let rest 30 minutes. (30 mins) Stretch & fold + bulk fermentation (~4 hours)1. Uncover the bowl, sprinkle 2 tsp sea salt and a splash of water on top, and work in with hands until integrated. <, p id=”instruction-step-2″>2. Either in the bowl, or on an oiled counter, begin to stretch-and-fold the dough for a few minutes, until it begins to feel elastic and a little “bouncy.” Use a silicone dough scraper to help scoop the sides of the dough up as you work. This is messy work; expect the dough to remain sticky, though it will become more elastic and firm as you go., Shape the dough (40 mins), 1. Prepare your final proofing container: either a banneton basket or a medium bowl lined with a clean kitchen towel and sprinkled very liberally with flour., id=”instruction-step-4″>2. Pre-shape: Turn the dough onto a floured surface (sticky side up), then gently pull and stretch the dough from the bottom to the middle to create a ball shape, pinching the ends together in the middle to seal them together. If you prefer a batard or oblong shape, form the dough into a rough rectangle and fold one end halfway up the rectangle, then fold the other end in to meet it. Roll the dough into a rough log, using your fingertips to pinch together a seam along the length of the loaf and tuck and to seal the ends. Be careful to do this process gently so as not to deflate the gases that have allowed the dough to rise. Flip the dough over, cover with a tea towel, and rest for 30 mins., Final proof (2-12 hours), If baking immediately, allow the dough to prove at room temperature for two hours, or until it slowly springs back when poked. If time allows, I strongly recommend allowing a longer proof in the fridge for 8-12 hours. This allows the gluten to develop further and results in much better flavor., instruction-step-6″>1. Place a dutch oven (or pizza stone, if no dutch oven is available) inside your oven and preheat at 475-500 degrees (the hotter, the better) for 30 mins – 1 hour. Tip: place the dutch oven on top of a baking sheet to help prevent a burned bottom crust., nstruction-step-7″>2. If dough has proved overnight in the fridge, remove and allow to rest at room temperature while the oven is heating. Test the dough: You’ll know it’s ready to bake when you poke the dough gently with your finger and it springs back slowly (if it springs back very quickly, it needs a few more minutes; if the indentation stays, it has over-proved and should be baked immediately)., struction-step-8″>3. Turn the dough onto a piece of parchment paper, seam side down. Using a very sharp knife or razor blade, quickly and carefully score the bread, either two end-to-end criss-cross cuts, or some other decorative pattern. The key is to allow the bread a way to expand while baking so it doesn’t split., struction-step-9″>4. Remove the hot dutch oven from the oven and carefully transfer the dough, still on its parchment, into the pot (or transfer to baking stone/sheet, if using). Spritz or sprinkle the dough with water (to help create steam for a crisp, crackly crust), then replace the dutch oven lid, return to oven, and bake, covered, for 25 minutes., truction-step-10″>5. If using a dutch oven, reduce oven temperature to 450 degrees, remove lid, and bake 25-30 minutes more, until loaf is deep brown. (If baking on a stone or sheet, continue to bake uncovered until the crust is deep and dark.) Cool on a baking rack, avoiding slicing until the loaf is thoroughly cooled, about an hour. The loaf can be left out at room temperature for one day; after that, wrap it in plastic and place inside a zippered plastic bag.","[, (, ', s, o, u, r, d, o, u, g, h,  , s, t, a, r, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ,,  , ', t, b, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, 0, 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, 0, 0, ,,  , ', m, l, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 4, 2, 0, ,,  , ', m, l, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 5, 0, 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, h, o, l, e,  , w, h, e, a, t,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 5, 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, p, e, l, t,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 5, 0, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, i, n, e,  , s, e, a,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, 2, ,,  , ', g, r, a, m, s, ', ), ]"

This step is absolutely optional but makes for a much improved flavour. If you buy toasted unsalted nuts and seeds you’re already winning!, Toast nuts and seeds in the oven at for about 15 minutes. Keep a close eye on them as they can burn easily., Blitz the toasted nuts and seeds in a food processor until the nuts and seeds are broken down but not completely flour like in consistency. You’re going for some texture but not whole chunks of nuts., In a large bowl combine the semi ground nuts and seeds with rolled oats and remaining ingredients., Mix, mix mix until you have a unified batter., Pour your adventure bread batter into a silicone loaf pan or a regular loaf pan lined with parchment paper., Cover the loaf pan with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and place it in the fridge for a few hours or overnight. This step is very important! There are no eggs or gluten in this bread to bind the ingredients together. Psyllium husk is doing the binding and this step allows all the ingredients time to marry together for a bread that slices well and does not fall apart., When you’re ready to bake your bread remove the loaf from the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature on the kitchen counter. Preheat your oven to 400ºF (200ºC) and bake the bread for 55 minutes., Remove the bread from the oven and allow it to cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours. Yes 2 hours! This step is uber important! If you slice this adventure bread before it has completely cooled it might be gummy on the inside or crumble., Slice up your bread. Thin slices are best (around ½ inch / 12mm) I usually get 12 slices out of my loaf. Adventure bread slices can be wrapped in parchment paper and frozen for later consumption. The frozen slices can be placed directly into your toaster., Enjoy!

Gently release the dough from the sides of the bowl and turn it out onto the counter. Dust the top lightly with flour, just enough so your hands don't stick., Gently stretch the dough into a loose square. Dust any excess flour off the top. Fold the top two corners of the dough down into a point, then fold the point down over the middle of the dough to begin rolling it up into a loose log. Continue continue rolling, tucking the sides in as needed, until you have a log of dough with the seam side against the counter.

Dust the surface of the dough lightly with flour, cover it with a clean dish towel, and let it sit until the Dutch oven finishes preheating., Score the top of the loaf to create a vent for steam to escape. Carefully remove the Dutch oven from the oven. Take the lid off and set it aside. Use the parchment paper as a sling to pick the dough up and place it inside the Dutch oven.

Or, if you do not own a stand mixer, a regular large mixing bowl. Heat the milk on the stove or in the microwave until warm to touch, about 110°F (43°C). Pour warm milk on top of yeast/sugar. Whisk gently to combine, then loosely cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow to sit for 5-10 minutes. The mixture will be frothy after 5-10 minutes., If you do not have a mixer, you can mix the dough together with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in this step, Add the butter, egg, flour, salt, garlic powder, and rosemary. Beat on low speed for 3 minutes. Dough will be soft., Knead the dough:, Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if using the paddle) and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st Rise, Shape the kneaded dough into a ball. Place the dough in a greased bowl (I use nonstick spray to grease) and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place in a slightly warm environment to rise until doubled in size, around 60-90 minutes. (If desired, use my warm oven trick for rising. See my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), As the dough rises, prepare the filling in the next step and grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan., Make the filling, In a medium bowl, mix the soft butter, rosemary, parsley, garlic, and salt together. If the butter is soft enough, you can just mix it all together with a spoon or fork. You can use an electric mixer if that’s easier too. Cover tightly and set aside until ready to use. (Don’t refrigerate unless making well in advance. It’s easiest to spread on the dough when at room temperature. If refrigerated, let it come to room temperature before spreading on dough pieces.), Assemble the bread:, Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface. Divide it into 12 equal pieces, each about 1/4 cup of dough and a little larger than a golf ball. Using lightly floured hands, flatten each into a circle that’s about 4 inches in diameter. The circle doesn’t have to be perfectly round. I do not use a rolling pan to flatten, but you certainly can if you want. Spread 1-2 teaspoons of filling mixture onto each. Sprinkle each with 1 Tablespoon of cheese. Fold circles in half and line in prepared baking pan, round side up. See photos above for a visual., truction-step-8"">2nd Rise, 2nd Rise, Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rise once again in a slightly warm environment until puffy, about 45 minutes., Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position then preheat oven to 350°F (177°C)., Bake until golden brown, about 50 minutes. If you find the top of the loaf is browning too quickly, tent with aluminum foil. (Don’t be alarmed if there’s melted butter around the sides of the bread as it bakes, it will seep into the bread before it finishes.) Remove from the oven and place the pan on a wire rack. If desired, brush with melted butter for topping and sprinkle with sea salt., Cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then remove from the pan and serve warm., Cover and store leftovers at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Since the bread is extra crispy on the exterior, it will become a little hard after day 1.

If using active dry yeast, let the mixture stand until foaming and bubbly, about 5 minutes. If using instant yeast, proceed with the recipe. Add two cups of the flour, salt and 1 1/2 - 2 tablespoons of the chopped rosemary. Mix. Continue adding flour, gradually, until a soft dough is formed. Judge the dough based on texture and feel versus how much actual flour you've had to add based on the recipe. The dough should be slightly tacky to the touch but should hold its shape while still being soft and smooth. Knead the dough by hand or with an electric mixer for 4-5 minutes, adding additional flour only if the dough is overly sticky and not clearing the sides of the bowl., Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl and cover with greased plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until doubled in size, approximately 1-2 hours, depending on the warmth of your kitchen. Once doubled, gently deflate the dough and divide in half. Prepare a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper, a silpat liner or lightly grease with cooking spray. Shape the dough into two smooth, oval shaped loaves and place them on the baking sheet, one on each half of the tray so they have room to rise and bake without touching. Use a brush to slather the melted butter over the top of the loaves. Continue brushing on the butter until it is gone (the loaves will be well-saturated). Sprinkle the remaining chopped rosemary over the top of the loaves, patting down gently to set into the dough, if needed. Cover the loaves with lightly greased plastic wrap and let them rise again until puffy and nearly doubled, about an hour (again, the exact time will depend on temperature so judge the dough by how it looks)., Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Lightly sprinkle coarse salt over the top of the loaves. Bake the loaves for 18-20 minutes until browned and baked through.

Make the biga: Stir together the flour and yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add ¾ cup plus 2 Tablespoons of water, stirring until everything comes together and makes a coarse ball (or mix on low speed for 1 minute with the paddle attachment). Adjust the flour or water, according to need, so that the dough is neither too sticky nor too stiff. (It is better to err on the sticky side, as you can adjust easier during kneading. It is harder to add water once the dough firms up.), Sprinkle some flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Knead for 4 to 6 minutes (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook for 4 minutes), or until the dough is soft and pliable, tacky but not sticky. The internal temperature should be 77° to 81°F., Lightly oil a bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours, or until it nearly doubles in size., Remove the dough from the bowl, knead it lightly to degas, and return it to the bowl, covering the bowl with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the refrigerator overnight. You can keep this in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or freeze it in an airtight plastic bag for up to 3 months., 2. Remove the biga from the refrigerator 1 hour before you plan to make the bread. Cut it into about 10 small pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill., 3. Stir together the flour, salt, black pepper, and yeast into a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the biga pieces, mashed potatoes, oil, rosemary, and ¾ cup plus 2 Tablespoons water. Stir with a large spoon (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) for 1 minute, or until the ingredients form a ball. Add more water, if necessary, or more flour, if the dough is too sticky., 4. Sprinkle flour on the counter, transfer the dough to the counter, and begin to knead (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Knead for approximately 10 minutes (or 6 minutes by machine), adding more flour if needed, until the dough is soft and supple, tacky but not sticky. It should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Flatten the dough and spread the roasted garlic over the top. Gather the dough into a ball and knead it by hand for 1 minute (you will probably have to dust it with flour first to absorb the moisture from the garlic). Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap., 5. Ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size., 6. Remove the dough from the bowl and divide it into 2 equal pieces for loaves, or 18 equal pieces (about 2 ounces each) for dinner rolls. Shape each of the larger pieces into a boule, or shape the smaller pieces into rolls. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment (use 2 pans for rolls) and dust lightly with semolina flour or cornmeal. Place the dough on the parchment, separating the pieces so that they will not touch, even after they rise. Mist the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap., 7. Proof at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours (depending on the size of the pieces), or until the dough doubles in size., 8. Preheat the oven to 400°F with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Remove the plastic from the dough and lightly brush the breads or rolls with olive oil. You do not need to score these breads, but you can if you prefer., 9. Place the pan(s) in the oven. Bake the loaves for 20 minutes, then rotate the pan 180 degrees for even baking. The loaves will take 35 to 45 minutes total to bake. Bake the rolls for 10 minutes, rotate the pans, and then bake for 10 minutes longer. The loaves and rolls will be a rich golden brown all around, and the internal temperature should register at least 195°F. The loaves should make a hollow sound when thumped on the bottom. If the loaves or rolls are fully colored but seem too soft, turn off the oven and let them bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes to firm up., 10. Remove the finished loaves or rolls from the oven and cool on a rack for at least 1 hour for loaves and 20 minutes for rolls before serving.","[, (, ', b, i, g, a, ', ,,  , 7, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, 4, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 3, 8, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, l, a, c, k,  , p, e, p, p, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 0, 3, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 1, 4, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, o, t, a, t, o, e, s, ', ,,  , 6, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, ', ), ,,  , (, ', r, o, s, e, m, a, r, y, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 7, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, a, r, l, i, c, ', ,,  , 1, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, 1, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 0, ., 0, 5, 5, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 7, ,,  , ', o, u, n, c, e, s, ', ), ]"

Using ½ tsp olive oil and a paper towel, lightly coat the entire inside of dish to help prevent sticking. This will also help the bread to develop a nice, crispy crust. Alternatively, instead of olive oil, you can line the pan with parchment paper, no need to coat with any oil or spray., If you don't have a warm spot to place the dough to proof, set your oven to the 'Proof' setting, which is about 100° F., In a small bowl, combine warm water (about 110° F), sugar and yeast. Gently stir and set aside for 5-10 minutes. The yeast should start to bubble and foam at the top, which indicates your yeast is good!, In a stand mixer, combine gluten free flour, guar gum, salt, black pepper, Italian seasoning, and chopped rosemary until mixed (about 30 seconds)., Once the yeast has become bubbly and foamy, pour into the flour mixture. Add 2 Tbs olive oil. Mix on medium speed for 2-3 minutes, scraping down the sides if needed. The dough will be sticky., Transfer the dough to your prepared cast iron skillet. Using a spatula (get it wet to help prevent sticking), gently mound the dough into a ball, smoothing out the dough as you go. The ball should be about 4 inches in diameter., Using the remaining 1 tsp olive oil, gently rub it over the dough (this prevents the dough from drying out as it will not be covered during proofing. It also helps the bread develop a crispy crust.) Place the pan in a warm spot (I like the proof setting on my oven!) and allow the dough to double in size. This can take anywhere from 35-45 minutes, depending on the temperature. Keep an eye on the dough starting around 35 minutes to make sure it hasn't developed beyond your pan., Toward the end of the dough proof, preheat your oven to 425° F (removing the pan from the oven if necessary)., Sprinkle remaining 1/4 tsp kosher salt on the dough. If desired, make two slashes with a sharp knife on the top (purely decorative), but be careful not to slash too deep. Place in oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the outside crust is lightly browned., Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly before tearing into., Eat warm as is, or, our family favorite is to dip the bread into a small plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

Add water and mix together until incorporated and all the flour is mixed in. The dough will look and feel sticky and shaggy. If you need more flour or water to get to the stiff, shaggy consistency - add more as needed. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 1 hour or overnight (see notes below to decide your timing and respective yeast quantity)., Shaping: After its rest, the dough should be doubled in size and have bubbles on top of the dough. Dust a clean surface with flour. Dust your hands with flour as well. Using your hands or a bowl scraper, scoop out your dough onto the floured work surface. View your ball of dough as having 4 corners. Using a bench scraper or your hands, pull in each corner to gather into a round ball, creating a seam on top. Turn it over so the seam is now on the table and with your hands, continue to gently reinforce the round shape, by cupping your hands around the dough, and turning it several times. Pulling it on the table as you shape it will help give the dough tension., Rest: Coat a cast iron pan with 2 tbsp of olive oil. (Alternatively, you could use a baking sheet or pizza stone). Place the dough in the pan, seam side down. Gently rub the top with another 1-2 tbsp of olive oil until it's fully coated. Sprinkle the top with flaky sea salt and fresh rosemary. Cover and let it rest for 30-60 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 425℉., Bake: Once it's risen about 50% in size and feels puffier, place in preheated oven and bake for about 22-28 minutes, until the crust reaches a nice deep golden brown color.

Add the water. Using a rubber spatula, mix until the liquid is absorbed and the ingredients form a sticky dough ball. Rub the surface of the dough lightly with olive oil. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel, cloth bowl cover, or plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator immediately for at least 12 hours or for as long as three days. (See notes above if you need to skip the overnight rise for time purposes.) NOTE: It is important the dough really be slicked with olive oil especially if you are using a cloth bowl cover or tea towel as opposed to plastic wrap or a hard lid. If you are using a tea towel, consider securing it with a rubber band to make a more airtight cover. If you do not slick the dough with enough oil, you risk the dough drying out and forming a crust over the top layer., Line two 8- or 9-inch pie plates or a 9×13-inch pan (see notes above) with parchment paper or grease with butter or coat with nonstick cooking spray. (Note: This greasing step may seem excessive, but with some pans, it is imperative to do so to prevent sticking. With my USA pans, I can get away with olive oil alone; with my glass baking dishes, butter is a must.), Pour a tablespoon of oil into the center of each pan or 2 tablespoons of oil if using the 9×13-inch pan. Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center. Rotate the bowl in quarter turns as you deflate, turning the mass into a rough ball. Use the forks to split the dough into two equal pieces (or do not split if using the 9×13-inch pan). Place one piece into one of the prepared pans. Roll the dough ball in the oil to coat it all over, forming a rough ball. Repeat with the remaining piece. Let the dough balls rest for 3 to 4 hours depending on the temperature of your kitchen (Note: no need to cover for this room temperature rise)., Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat it to 425°F. If using the rosemary, sprinkle it over the dough. Pour a tablespoon of oil over each round of dough (or two tablespoons if using a 9×13-inch pan). Rub your hands lightly in the oil to coat, then, using all of your fingers, press straight down to create deep dimples. If necessary, gently stretch the dough as you dimple to allow the dough to fill the pan. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt all over., Transfer the pans or pan to the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the underside is golden and crisp. Remove the pans or pan from the oven and transfer the focaccia to a cooling rack. Let it cool for 10 minutes before cutting and serving; let it cool completely if you are halving it with the intention of making a sandwich.","[, (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 5, 1, 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 8, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 4, 5, 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 4, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, e, a,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', r, o, s, e, m, a, r, y,  , l, e, a, v, e, s, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ]"

db6d3054,https://www.wellplated.com/rosemary-olive-oil-bread/,Rosemary Olive Oil Bread,"3/4 cup warm water ((100-110 F – I recommend taking the temp if you can!)), 1 tablespoon honey, 1 packet active dry yeast (1 1/4 ounces or 2 1/4 teaspoons), 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (divided), 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour, 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (plus extra for kneading), 1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten*, 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary (divided), 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/4 teaspoon dried basil, 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, Flaky sea salt (such as maldon or fleur de sel)","Proof, In a large bowl (or if you will be using a stand mixer, the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook), combine the warm water, honey, and yeast. Let sit 10 minutes to proof. The yeast should look foamy (if it doesn't, the yeast is dead or the water was too hot or too cold; your bread won't rise, so you will need to start over)., Oil, Stir in 3 tablespoons of the olive oil., Whisk, In a separate bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and vital wheat gluten (if using). Stir in 1 tablespoon of the rosemary, salt, garlic, oregano, basil, and pepper., Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with yeast and stir by hand (or mix with the hook), until the dough forms a ball. If the dough seems dry, sprinkle water over the top 1 tablespoon at a time, until it holds together in a rough ball., Knead, Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough for 10 minutes by hand (or mix with the dough hook for 8 minutes on medium low), until the dough is smooth and elastic. The dough should be tacky and moist but should not be overtly sticky and cling to your hands. If it is too sticky, add additional all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon at a time, being sure to knead (or mix) it in completely before adding more., Rise, Lightly coat a clean bowl with nonstick spray or olive oil. Place the dough in the bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until nearly doubled in size, about 1 to 2 hours. (An unheated oven is a great place for this—just don’t forget about the dough and preheat your oven by mistake! Not that I’ve done this…). If your kitchen is extra cool (or your dough is being stubborn), you may need to let it rise for longer. Don't rush the process., Flour, Once the dough has nearly doubled, lightly flour a sheet of parchment paper and turn the dough out onto it (you do not need to punch it down)., Shape, Lightly flour your hands. Gently take the top edge of the dough and stretch it away from you. Fold it up and over so that it touches the center. Repeat with the bottom, then the left and right sides so that you create a rough square., Flip, With a spatula or bench scraper (or gentle fingers) flip the dough over. Cup your hands around the dough and tuck the edges under to form a round ball, starting at the square's ""corners."" Place seam-side down on the parchment paper., Cover with a clean towel, then let rise until nearly doubled in size, about 1 to 2 hours more (again, you may need longer depending upon the temperature of your kitchen)., Preheat, When it's nearing time to bake, place a pizza stone (if you have one) or Dutch oven in the oven and preheat the oven (with the stone/Dutch oven in it) to 400 degrees F., Trim, If you are using a Dutch oven, once the dough has finished its second rise and you are ready to bake, trim two opposite sides of the paper to fashion ""handles,"" then trim around the bread to create a bread sling, which makes it easier to lower in the Dutch oven (see photos)., Score, With a sharp knife or bread lame, cut an “X” in the top of the loaf that is 1/4-inch deep to allow steam to escape during baking., Bake, Using the parchment paper, gently lift the dough onto the preheated stone or into the Dutch oven. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove the dough from the oven and brush the remaining 1 tablespoon oil over the top. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon rosemary and a big pinch of flaky salt. Return to the oven and bake 10 to 15 minutes more, until the internal temperature reaches 195 degrees on an instant read thermometer. (If not using an instant read thermometer, look for the top to be golden brown and bread to sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.) Keep an eye on the bread towards the end of its baking time. If it starts to look darker than you would like, loosely tent it with foil., Cool, Transfer the dough to a cooling rack and let cool to (almost) room temperature (if you can stand it), then slice and serve warm.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 7, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, o, n, e, y, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', p, a, c, k, e, t, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 4, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, h, e, a, t,  , g, l, u, t, e, n, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', r, o, s, e, m, a, r, y, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, a, r, l, i, c,  , p, o, w, d, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, r, e, g, a, n, o, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, a, s, i, l, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, l, a, c, k,  , p, e, p, p, e, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ]"

Using a wooden spoon or spatula, stir the ingredients together until no traces of dry flour remain. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, set in a warm place and let the dough rest for 1 hour., Prepare the inclusions: Using an apple peeler, strip the rind off of 1 lemon, but be careful not peel too deeply into the bitter white pith. Finely chop the rind and set aside., Add the starter and inclusions: Add the sourdough starter, salt, dried rosemary and lemon peel to the autolysed dough. Fold the dough over the sourdough starter and the inclusions until fully incorporated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set in a warm place for 30 minutes., Strengthen the dough: Perform a coil fold by picking the center of the dough with your fingertips. Lift the dough until the ends release from the bowl. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and perform another coil fold. Transfer the dough to a clean, lightly-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place for 30 minutes., Working in the bowl, complete 3 to 4 more sets of coil folds in 30 minute intervals. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set in a warm place after each fold. Once the dough looks smooth and feels strong, let the dough rest untouched for 1 hour., Preshape the dough: Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface. Using a bench knife, turn the dough over and gently round it into a tight ball. Cover the dough with a tea towel and leave the dough to rest for 30 minutes., Shape the dough: Shape the dough into a boule or a batard.

e197aafa,https://www.pantrymama.com/sourdough-parmesan-bread-with-rosemary/,Sourdough Parmesan Bread with Rosemary,"500 g Bread Flour, 350 g Water, 50 g Sourdough Starter ((Fed and Bubbly)), 150 g Parmesan Cheese (Shaved or Shredded), 10 g Salt ((increase or decrease according to your taste)), 1 sprig Rosemary (fresh leaves)","Autolyse - Premixing The DoughWeigh out your sourdough starter and water into a large ceramic or glass bowl. Glass is always good as you can see what's happening underneath your dough. This recipe is based on you having an active starter that you have fed a few hours before starting your bake.Mix the water and starter together briefly. Then add your flour and salt and mix whole lot together to form a shaggy dough. I find a dough scraper the easiest way to mix it as you can keep the sides of bowl clean.The dough will be fairly shaggy and only just brought together (see photo). You might wonder how this will turn into bread, but just wait, time is your friend and the dough will change in around an hour., Cover your bowl with cling film or a damp tea towel and let it sit for around 1 hour. It's ok if it's a little bit longer, it's not going to matter too much.This process is called the ""autolyse"" and allows your flour to soak in all the water and become hydrated. You can see how the dough has changed in this photo., Forming Up The DoughAfter the dough has been through autolyse you need to bring it together into a ball. Work your way around the bowl, grabbing the dough from the outside, stretching it up and over itself, into the centre, until a smooth ball is formed. You shouldn't need more than about 20-25 stretches to form the ball.You'll notice that the dough is fully hydrated after soaking all the water up. It will be fairly sticky but as you bring it into a ball, it will become smoother and shinier., Once the dough has formed into a smooth ball, pop the cling film back on and let it rest for 30 minutes., Stretch & Fold + Adding Parmesan & RosemaryOver the next few hours you need to create some structure for your dough by ""stretching and folding"", as well as incorporating the rosemary and parmesan.Aim to do around 4-6 sets of stretches and folds. For each set, stretch the dough up and over itself 4 times. Leave around 15 minutes in between each set. Again you do not have to be exact with time, but you need to do at least 4 sets over 2 hours.You'll need to add the parmesan and rosemary around the second set of stretch and folds., Bulk FermentOnce you've finished your stretch and folds, place the cling film or damp tea towel back over your dough and let it rest and ferment. See notes below for more info on this step., Shaping The DoughOnce your dough has finished it's first ferment, it's time to shape it into either a boule or a batard (or couronne if you have one)., Placing Into A BannetonOnce the dough is shaped into a tight ball, place it into your banneton smooth side down, so your seam is on the top - this way the top of your dough will get the pretty lines from the banneton. If you're using a cloth or tea towel in a bowl it's ok to put your dough with the smooth side up. Just make sure the dough is tight.Lift your dough around the edges to pop a little more rice flour if you feel it needs it. Just try to handle the dough as little as possible and be really gentle as you really want to preserve all the gases and air bubbles that have formed during your bulk ferment., Cold FermentNow the dough is in its ""shaping container"" cover it loosely with a plastic bag or damp tea towel and place into the fridge. I use a large plastic bag to cover it - I just reuse it each time. Try to leave it in the fridge for a minimum 5 hours up to a maximum of around 36 hours. The longer you leave it the better your bread will be! A longer cold ferment creates beautiful blisters on your crust and a deeper sourdough flavour. It will also ensure your dough forms a skin which makes it easier to score., Preparing To BakeOnce you're ready to bake your sourdough, you'll need to preheat your oven to 230C/450F. Place your Dutch Oven into the oven when you turn it on so it gets hot. Try to preheat for around 1 hour to ensure your oven is super hot - but you know your oven so just adjust this time if you need to.Leave your dough in the fridge until the very last minute - placing a cold dough into a hot oven will give you a great ""spring""., Bake Time!Now it's time to bake!When your oven is at temperature, take your sourdough out of the fridge. Gently place it onto a piece of baking paper. Make sure that you make the baking paper big enough to use the edges as a handle to lower to dough into your Dutch Oven.Gently score your bread with a lame, clean razor blade or knife. At minimum a large cross is sufficient, but you can get as artistic as you like. Try to score it fairly deep to ensure the dough opens up.Carefully take your dutch oven out of the oven. Place the sourdough into the pot using the baking paper as a handle. Put the lid on and place into the hot oven. If you want to you can spritz your dough with extra water before you put the lid on.BAKE TIME:30 Minutes with the lid on at 230C/450F plus10-15 Minutes with the lid off at 210C/410F, Finishing The BakeWhen you remove your dough from the oven, carefully remove it from the dutch oven as soon as possible and place on a wire rack to cool.","[, (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 5, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 3, 5, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, o, u, r, d, o, u, g, h,  , s, t, a, r, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 5, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, a, r, m, e, s, a, n,  , c, h, e, e, s, e, ', ,,  , 1, 5, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', r, o, s, e, m, a, r, y, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', s, p, r, i, g, ', ), ]"

Plus a recipe for Olive Oil Herb Dip","3½ cups all purpose flour, 1 packet dry active yeast (2¼ teaspoons), 1¼ cups warm water, ¼ cup fresh rosemary, chopped, divided, 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 teaspoon sea salt or kosher salt, divided, Parchment paper, Paper towels, Crock Pot, 3 cloves fresh garlic, minced, 1/2 teaspoon fresh rosemary, chopped, 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/4 teaspoon dried basil, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, Red pepper flakes, to taste, 1 teaspoon Parmesan cheese, grated, 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil","In a large bowl, mix together the water, yeast, and sugar. Let sit 10 minutes. The mixture should become bubbly., Stir in half of the salt (1/2 teaspoon), half of the rosemary (2 tablespoons), the 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, and all of the flour. Mix until fully combined. Work it together with your hands, if necessary., Lightly grease a large bowl and place the dough in. Cover it with a kitchen towel and leave the dough in a warm, draft-free area. Let it sit and rise for 1 hour., Remove the dough from the bowl and gently roll it into a ball on a floured surface. Let it sit for another 20 minutes., Set the crock pot to high. Line the crock pot with two pieces of parchment paper, leaving at least 2 inches hanging out of each side of the crock pot. Place the dough in the crock pot and sprinkle it with the remaining salt and rosemary., Drape paper towels over the top of the crock pot and then place the lid on. This should capture any moisture that would sit on the lid and prevent it from dripping back onto your bread., Cook the bread for 2 hours, and remove from the crock pot. It will most likely still be a bit pale on the outside. It tastes great this way, but I like to put mine on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and put it under the broiler for a quick few minutes to get a crunchier, darker crust. Watch the bread the whole time to ensure that it does not burn., Let cool before slicing. As the bread cools, combine all of the dip ingredients in a bowl or dish and mix well.

Scatter another tablespoon of flour on top, then using a bench scraper or with floured hands, pick up each edge of the dough and fold it back onto itself to form a very rough ball. Set a piece of baking paper that fits inside your dutch oven, next to the dough, then turn the dough onto it, so the seam side is down. Use both hands to rotate the dough and form it into a rough ball. Don’t worry if it’s not perfect or looks a little flat – this is rustic bread! Make a crisis cross slash in the top of the dough, then sprinkle the extra tablespoon of grated parmesan on top., Bake the bread, Carefully remove your pre-heated Dutch oven from the oven, then transfer the dough, still on the baking paper, into the pot and put the lid on (or use a sheet pan/aluminium foil if your pot has no lid). Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the lid and bake for another 15 minutes, until the top is golden brown and the bread is smelling gorgeous. Transfer it to a wire rack to cool for about 15 minutes, then slice and devour.

Cook over medium heat, stirring until a thick, white paste is formed, about 2 minutes. Cool for about 10 minutes., To make the Dough: In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix together the remaining bread flour, salt, sugar, yeast, whole milk, buttermilk, egg, butter, and rosemary for 1 minute. Add the roux (Tangzhong) and mix until it comes together to make a uniform dough, about 5 to 8 minutes. Cover with a wet towel or plastic wrap and let rest for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until it has doubled in size., While the dough is rising, prepare the crockpot. Pad the bottom of a 6-quart crockpot insert with a piece of crumpled-up aluminum foil that is about 1/2-inch thick (this will protect the bottom of the rolls from over-browning), then line the entire insert of the crockpot with a larger sheet of foil and finally place a large piece of parchment paper over the foil (These steps prevent the dough from sticking to the sides as they rise and bake)., Once the dough is fully risen, turn it out onto a floured surface and divide into 8 to 12 portions. Roll into round buns. Place the buns into the prepared crock pot and ""bake"" on the ""high"" setting for about 1 1⁄2 hours, the timing will depend on your machine. Don’t uncover until the tops look set. They will be pale in color and may deflate a bit when uncovered, so check them quickly by tapping lightly on the top. Check the center buns. If they seem set and not like raw dough, they can be finished under the broiler., Once they are done cooking in the crockpot, remove the rolls and place on a baking sheet. Brush with butter and broil in the oven for about 5 minutes to brown and finish the baking. Brush with more butter and flaky sea salt. Serve warm or at room temperature.

In a bowl, combine the shredded cheddar cheese, parmesan cheese, dried Italian herbs, and granulated garlic. Mix to combine, set aside., Prepare an 8x8"" baking pan. Drizzle 1-2 teaspoons of olive in the bottom of the pan, and use your fingers or a pastry brush to coat the bottom and sides of the pan completely, set aside., Pour the dough out onto a floured work surface. Divide the dough in half. Use your hands to stretch the dough out into a square-ish shape to fit the pan. The dough should be very stretchy and easy to work with. Place the flattened dough into the bottom of the prepared pan, and use your fingers to stretch it out to fit the pan, making sure to get into the corners., Sprinkle the cheese filling on top of the bottom layer. Repeat the process with the second piece of dough, and lay it over the filling carefully. Use your fingers to seal in the filling by pressing down on the sides. Cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let proof at room temperature for 45 minutes - 1 hour, until the dough is puffy, and almost reaches the top edge of the pan. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F., Drizzle the 2 teaspoons of olive on top of dough. Use your fingers to dimple the surface of the dough for that signature focaccia look. Scatter the rosemary leaves on top, and sprinkle the flakey sea salt all over. Bake for 30-35 minutes until the top is deeply golden brown. Allow to cool slightly, then enjoy! Focaccia is best eaten the same day, but any leftovers can be stored in the fridge, and reheated in a toaster oven or a 350 degree F oven for 10 minutes.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 3, 3, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', c, h, e, d, d, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', p, a, r, m, e, s, a, n, ', ,,  , 0, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', i, t, a, l, i, a, n,  , h, e, r, b, s, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, a, r, l, i, c, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', r, o, s, e, m, a, r, y, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, e, a,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ]"

Add the flour and salt. Mix to combine, finishing by hand if necessary to form a rough dough. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes., Stretch and fold, After 30 minutes, grab a corner of the dough and pull it up and into the center. Repeat until you’ve performed this series of folds 4 to 5 times with the dough. Let dough rest for another 30 minutes and repeat the stretching and folding action. If you have the time: do this twice more for a total of 4 times in 2 hours. Note: Even if you can only perform one series of stretches and folds, your dough will benefit. So don’t worry if you have to run off shortly after you mix the dough., Bulk Fermentation (first rise), Cover the bowl with a towel and let rise at room temperature, about 8 to 10 hours at 70°F (21°C) or even less if you live in a warm environment. The dough is ready when it has increased by 50% in volume, has a few bubbles on the surface, and jiggles when you move the bowl from side to side. (UPDATE: In the past I have recommended letting the dough rise until it doubles in volume. If you’ve had success with this, continue to let the dough double. Recently, I have been stopping the bulk fermentation when the dough increases by 50% in volume, and I feel I am actually getting better oven spring in the end.) (Note regarding timing: If you are using 100 g of starter, the bulk fermentation may take less than 8 to 10 hours. If you live in a warm, humid environment, the bulk fermentation may take even less time. In the late spring/early summer, for example, my kitchen is 78ºF and the bulk fermentation takes 6 hours. It is best to rely on visual cues (increase in volume by roughly 50%) as opposed to time to determine when the bulk fermentation is done. A straight-sided vessel makes monitoring the bulk fermentation especially easy because it allows you to see when your dough has truly increased in volume by 50%.), Shape (See notes above), Coax the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Gently shape it into a round: fold the top down to the center, turn the dough, fold the top down to the center, turn the dough; repeat until you’ve come full circle. If you have a bench scraper, use it to push and pull the dough to create tension., Rest, Let the dough rest seam side up rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, line an 8-inch (20-cm) bowl or proofing basket with a towel (flour sack towels are ideal) and dust with flour (preferably rice flour, which doesn’t burn the way all-purpose flour does). Using a bench scraper or your hands, shape it again as described in step 4. Place the round into your lined bowl, seam side up., Proof (second rise), Cover the dough and refrigerate for 1 hour or for as long as 48 hours. (Note: I prefer to let this dough proof for at least 24 hours prior to baking. See video for the difference in the crumb of a loaf that has proofed for 6 hours vs one that has proofed for 24 hours. If you choose to proof the dough in the fridge for an extended period of time, you may want to tuck it into a loosely tied bag — produce bags from the grocery store are great for this purpose — to ensure the dough does not dry out. The original recipe calls for a 1-hour rise, and if you have had success doing that, by all means, keep doing it.), Place a Dutch oven in your oven, and preheat your oven to 550°F (290°C). Cut a piece of parchment to fit the size of your baking pot., Score, Place the parchment over the dough and invert the bowl to release. Using the tip of a small knife or a razor blade, score the dough however you wish — a simple “X” is nice. Use the parchment to carefully transfer the dough into the preheated baking pot., Bake, Lower the oven to temperature to 450ºF (230ºC). Carefully cover the pot. Bake the dough for 30 minutes, covered. Remove the lid, lower the temperature to 400ºF (200ºC) and continue to bake for 10 – 15 minutes more. If necessary, lift the loaf out of the pot, and bake directly on the oven rack for the last 5 to 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour before slicing., This loaf will stay fresh up to 3 days stored at room temperature in an airtight plastic bag or container.

This may be difficult and you may need to kind of bounce the dough to get it to stretch. Place dough that is in your hands back into the center. Turn the bowl about a quarter turn and complete another stretch and fold. Repeat two more times. This is considered one round., Thirty minutes later, complete another round of stretch and folds. Cover and allow the dough to rest another 30 minutes., Complete one last stretch and fold round., Cover with a lid, damp towel, or plastic wrap. Let the dough bulk ferment in a warm place until it has doubled in size. This could be anywhere from 6-12 hours (or longer) depending on the temperature of your kitchen, maturity of your starter, etc. Be careful not to let it over ferment., Shape, Place the dough on a clean work surface that has been lightly dusted with flour. Fold the dough onto itself and roll up. Then shape into a ball by gently spinning it toward you., Optional - Let the dough sit out for 15-20 minutes uncovered. This prevents the dough from sticking to the tea towel during the overnight rise., Turn over and shape. I do this by folding the two sides over to meet in the middle, pinch together and then repeat on the other two sides.

Let the dough rest for 12-15 hours in the refrigerator. You can also let the bread rise at room temperature for 3-4 hours. I like using the longer rise time in the refrigerator because it is easier to score and feel like the oven spring is better., Bake, Preheat a dutch oven to 500 degrees for 1 hour., Remove dough from the fridge right before baking. Place dough on a piece of parchment paper., Dust with flour, if desired, and score with lame or razor blade.

Add the water. Mix until the flour is absorbed. (If you are using active dry yeast, see notes below.), Let it rise, Cover bowl with a tea towel or plastic wrap and set aside in a warm spot to rise for at least an hour. (In the winter or if you are letting the bread rise in a cool place, it might take as long as two hours to rise.) This is how to create a slightly warm spot for your bread to rise in: Turn the oven on at any temperature (350ºF or so) for one minute, then turn it off. Note: Do not allow the oven to get up to 300ºF, for example, and then heat at that setting for 1 minute — this will be too hot. Just let the oven preheat for a total of 1 minute — it likely won’t get above 100ºF. The goal is to just create a slightly warm environment for the bread., Preheat the oven to 425ºF, . Grease two 1-qt or 1.5-qt oven-safe bowls (see notes below) with about a tablespoon of butter each. Using two forks, punch down your dough, scraping it from the sides of the bowl, which it will be clinging to. As you scrape it down try to pull the dough toward the center (see video below for guidance). You want to loosen the dough entirely from the sides of the bowl, and you want to make sure you’ve punched it down. Then, take your two forks and divide the dough into two equal portions — eye the center of the mass of dough, and starting from the center and working out, pull the dough apart with the two forks. Then scoop up each half and place into your prepared bowls. This part can be a little messy — the dough is very wet and will slip all over the place. Using small forks or forks with short tines makes this easier — my small salad forks work best; my dinner forks make it harder. It’s best to scoop it up fast and plop it in the bowl in one fell swoop. Some people like to use flexible, plastic dough scrapers for this step., Let the dough rise again, for about 20 to 30 minutes on the countertop near the oven (or near a warm spot) or until it has risen to just below or above (depending on what size bowl you are using) the top of the bowls. (Note: Do not do the warm-oven trick for the second rise, and do not cover your bowls for the second rise. Simply set your bowls on top of your oven, so that they are in a warm spot. Twenty minutes in this spot usually is enough for my loaves.), Bake it, Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375º and bake for 15 to 17 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and turn the loaves onto cooling racks. If you’ve greased the bowls well, the loaves should fall right out onto the cooling racks. If the loaves look a little pale and soft when you’ve turned them out onto your cooling racks, place the loaves into the oven (outside of their bowls) and let them bake for about 5 minutes longer. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes before cutting.","[, (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 5, 1, 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 4, 5, 4, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 8, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 8, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ]"

You MUST try it once!, Begin by proofing the yeast. Combine the yeast, water, and sugar and mix. Set aside about 8 minutes until the yeast is activated. It is ready when a puffy cloud forms over the water. Your yeast is good and ready!, Combine the flour with the salt in the bowl of a tabletop mixer and mix the ingredients to combine. Add the yeast mixture and the olive oil. With the dough hook attachment, knead on low speed for 7-8 minutes., This can also be done in a large bowl by hand. The kneading time will increase to 10-12 minutes or until the dough is soft and smooth., Place the dough in an oiled bowl covered with a kitchen towel or with plastic wrap. Set aside to rise until doubled in size. This takes about 45 minutes to 1 hour. It may take longer if it is cold in your home., Preheat oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, 260 degrees Celsius., Tip: If you have a cast iron pan and a pizza stone place the cast iron pan on the lowest rack of your oven and the pizza stone in the middle rack. Place them in the oven while the oven is cold so that the pizza stone does not crack. Let them warm while the oven is preheating. Doing this will help you create bakery style bread rings. Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside., Punch the dough down and form into a ball. You may also form it into a baguette. I prefer the round shape., Place the formed dough onto a half sheet pan lined with parchment paper and cover with a clean towel. Set aside to rise about 30 minutes. It will almost double in size., Brush the top of the dough with water. Make 4 decorative slices on top and sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired., To create a nice crusty top, pour 1 cup of ice water in the cast iron pan to create steam. Place the baking tray with the dough on it on the middle oven rack. Reduce the oven temperature to 450 degrees Fahrenheit, 232 degrees Celsius. Let it bake for 30 minutes., Remove the bread from the pan and place directly onto the pizza stone and bake 5 more minutes. This will make the bread have an extra crispy crust., Allow the bread to rest at room temperature at least 30 minutes before slicing.

20ed30fe,https://cloudykitchen.com/blog/white-bread-loaf/,Soft and Fluffy White Bread Loaf,"One batch of white bread dough, risen and ready to use (see dough post for rising options), Softened butter for greasing the loaf pans, Egg wash - one egg whisked with 1 Tbsp water","Start with risen white bread dough. If you have chosen to do a cold first rise, you will need to leave the dough out at room temperature for about 30 minutes to allow it to soften slightly so that it is easier to work with., Grease two 1 lb loaf pans (8.5 x 4.5"" / 22cm x 12.5cm) with softened butter., Turn out the risen dough onto a lightly floured, clean work surface. Divide it into two even pieces (the dough makes about 850g of dough so divide it into two 425g pieces)., Shape each piece into a ball using a bench scraper and using the counter to create tension. Cover the pieces of bread dough with a clean tea towel and leave to rest for about 10 minutes., Working with one piece of dough at a time, shape the dough into a loaf shape - turn the dough over so the 'good' side is facing down., Flatten the dough out using your hands into a rectangle about the width that your tin is long. For a 1lb loaf pan, this is about 20cm x 15cm (8x6""). Fold over a little of the short edges to form a rough square shape (this does not have to be exact). This helps to give you nice clean ends on your bread., Fold the top third of the dough down, and press with your fingers so that it sticks to the dough underneath - you want to form a gentle seal. Roll the rest of the dough down toward you as tightly as you can. Pull the sausage of bread against the counter to help seal the seam and make sure that the ends are nicely tucked in., Place the dough into the loaf pan carefully, seam side down. It will not completely touch the ends of the pan., Repeat the shaping process with the second piece of dough to form a second loaf., Cover the pans with plastic wrap or a clean tea towel and place in a warm spot until the dough has doubled in size and is nearing the top edge of the pan, about one hour depending on the temperature of your kitchen. To check the rise on the dough, lightly press it with a floured finger - if it is fully risen it will leave an indentation that slowly springs back. If you have started with a cold dough, this step will take 2-3 hours as you need to account for the dough warming up., While the loaves are rising, preheat the oven to 180°c / 350°f. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven., When the loaves are risen, brush the surface of the dough with egg wash., Bake the white bread loaves for 25 to 30 minutes, until deeply golden brown. If you want to check the internal temperature, a fully baked loaf should register at 190°f / 88°c when probed with a digital thermometer., Remove the loaves from the oven and place on a cooling rack. Leave to cool in the pans for 10-15 minutes then turn out of the pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely., Slice when cool. Store leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days. Best eaten fresh on the day it is made, however leftovers are amazing either slightly warmed up, or lightly toasted.","[, (, ', w, h, i, t, e,  , b, r, e, a, d,  , d, o, u, g, h, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', b, a, t, c, h, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , N, o, n, e, ,,  , N, o, n, e, ), ,,  , (, ', e, g, g, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ]"

Add the flour and salt. Squish everything together with your hands until all of the flour is absorbed. The dough will be dry and shaggy. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, reusable wrap or a clean, very damp kitchen towel. Let rest (autolyse) for 30 minutes or up to 1 hour, if preferred., After the dough has rested, work the dough in the bowl into a rough ball, about 15 seconds., Bulk Rise, Now the dough needs to rise., Cover the bowl with wrap or a very damp kitchen cloth. Let rest in a warm spot to rise. The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense and has doubled in size. This can take anywhere from 3-12 hours depending on the temperature of your ingredients, the potency of your starter and surrounding environment. For example, in the summer rise times can take anywhere between 2-4 hours @ 85º F/ 29º C whereas in the winter, the dough will take about 10-12 hours @ 68º F/ 20º C., Optional Step: Stretch & Fold the Dough, During bulk rise, you have the option to perform a series of ‘stretch & folds’ to strengthen the dough. Start 30 minutes into the bulk rise. Gather a portion of the dough, stretch it upwards and then fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl ¼ turn and repeat this process until you have come full circle to complete 1 set. Do this once or twice spaced about an hour apart. Although this step is not mandatory, it will increase the total volume and height of your bread. Click here for a step-by-step video tutorial., Cut & Shape the Dough, Divide your work surface in half; lightly flour one side (for cutting) and leave the other half clean (for shaping)., Remove the dough from the bowl, and place onto the floured section so that it does not stick. You do not need to ‘punch down’ the dough; it will gently deflate as you fold and shape it., Cut the dough in half to make 2 loaves, or leave it whole for a single loaf., To shape, use a bench scraper to move your dough to the non-floured section (if there is any flour present, it will be difficult to shape- brush away any excess). Starting at the top, fold the dough over toward the center. Give it a slight turn, and then fold over the next section of dough. Repeat until you have come full circle., Then flip the dough over and place it seam side down. Using your hands, gently cup the sides of the dough and rotate it, using quarter turns in a circular motion. You can also pull it towards you to even out the shape. Repeat this process until you are happy with its appearance. *See note below., Second Rise, Now the dough needs to rise again, but for a shorter period of time., Coat the bottom of your Dutch oven with cornmeal. Alternatively, use parchment paper to prevent sticking (this is what I do, now). Place the dough inside for a second shorter rise, about 30 minutes to 1 hour and cover with the lid of the pot or a very damp cloth. The dough ready when it is slightly puffy but not double in size., Preheat your oven to 450º F/ 232º C towards the tail end of the second rise., Score the Dough, Right before your bread goes into the oven, make a shallow slash about 2-3 inches long (or more) in the center of the dough. Use a bread lame, sharp pairing or a small serrated steak knife. The cut should be about 1/4-inch deep., Bake the Dough, Place the bread into the oven on the center rack (lid on) and reduce the temperature to 400° F/ 204° C. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the lid, and continue to bake (uncovered) for an additional 40 minutes or until deep, golden brown. Keep in mind that all ovens are different; you might have to make minimal adjustments to these temperatures., You can also take the internal temperature of your bread to double check that it is done. For sourdough, it should read about 205-210º F/ 96-98º C., Remove the bread from the oven, and cool on a wire rack for at least an hour before slicing.

I like to feed mine the morning before I plan to make my dough or at least a few hours before. Your starter will be ready to use when it is at its peak and before it starts to shrink back down in size., To make your bread dough, measure out your active sourdough starter into a medium mixing bowl., Add the water, and stir well with a fork to combine well., Add the flour and salt, and use the fork to combine the mixture well. It will won't look like like bread dough yet; just stir it well to combine and that's good enough., Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel, and let rest for 1 hour at room temperature., After an hour, use your hands to gently pull the edge of the dough near the side of the bowl and push it down into the middle of the bowl. Do this, rotating round the bowl, until the dough starts to look like bread dough and comes together in more of a ball. This should take about a minute of going round the bowl 2 to 3 times pulling and tucking into the center., Cover the bread dough with a damp kitchen towel and let it rise for 8 to 10 hours at room temperature. This is known as the bulk rise. I typically let mine rise overnight., After the bulk rise, gently remove the dough from the bowl onto a lightly floured surface. Tuck the edges of the dough into the center and work around the edges until you've tucked them all in. Flip the ball dough over. Let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes., Using your hands, gently pull the dough ball towards you, letting its grip on the counter pull it into a tighter ball. Rotate the dough slightly and repeat around the edges until you've formed a tight ball (if this is confusing, watch the video on the post where I demonstrate how to do this! It's not hard once you see it done once)., Prepare a bread proofing basket by dusting it well with flour (if it's new, you'll need to season it by spraying it with a little water and then adding the flour so it sticks), or you can use a medium mixing bowl (about 8 inches across).

Add 1/2 cup flour and whisk together. Place the mixing bowl in a warm place, uncovered to form a lose sponge. Give it 15 minutes or so, the mixture should bubble., Form the pita dough, Now add salt, olive oil and almost all the remaining flour (keep about 1/2 cup of the flour for dusting later). Stir until mixture forms a shaggy mass (at this point, the dough has little to no gluten development and just looks like a sticky mess and you can easily pull bits off). Dust with a little flour, then knead the mixture inside the bowl for about a minute to incorporate any stray bits., Knead the dough, Dust a clean working surface with just a little bit of flour. Knead lightly for a couple minutes or so until smooth. Cover and let the dough rest for 10 minutes, then knead again for a couple more minutes. The dough should be a little bit moist, you can help it with a little dusting of flour, but be careful not to add too much flour., Let the dough rise, Clean the mixing bowl and coat it lightly with extra virgin olive oil and put the dough back in the bowl. Turn the dough a couple times in the bowl to coat with the olive oil. Cover the mixing bowl tightly with plastic wrap then lay a kitchen towel over. Put the bowl in a warm place. Leave it alone for 1 hour or until the dough rises to double its size., Divide the dough., Deflate the dough and place it on a clean work surface. Divide the dough into 7 to 8 equal pieces and shape them into balls. Cover with a towel and leave them for 10 minutes or so to rest., Shape the pitas., Using a floured rolling pin, roll one of the pieces into a circle that's 8-9 inches wide and about a quarter inch thick. It helps to lift and turn the dough frequently as you roll so that dough doesn't stick to your counter too much. (If dough starts to stick, sprinkle a tiny bit of flour). If the dough starts to spring back, set it aside to rest for a few minutes, then continue rolling. Repeat with the other pieces of dough. (Once you get going, you can be cooking one pita while rolling another, if you like). You have two options for baking the pita from here., To bake pita in the oven:, Heat the oven to 475 degrees F and place a heavy-duty baking pan or large cast iron skillet on the middle rack to heat. Working in batches, place the rolled-out pitas directly on the hot baking baking sheet (I was only able to fit 2 at a time). Bake for 2 minutes on one side, and then, using a pair of tongs, carefully turn pita over to bake for 1 minute on the other side. The pita will puff nicely and should be ready. Remove from the oven and cover the baked pitas with a clean towel while you work on the rest of the pitas., To cook pita on stovetop: Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. (Test by adding a couple drops of water to the skillet, the skillet is ready when the beads of water sizzle immediately). Drizzle a tiny bit of extra virgin olive oil and wipe off any excess. Working with one pita at a time, lay a rolled-out pita on the skillet and bake for 30 seconds, until bubbles start to form. Using a spatula, flip the pita over and cook for 1-2 minutes on the other side, until large toasted spots appear on the underside. Flip again and cook another 1-2 minutes to toast the other side. The pita is ready when it puffs up forming a pocket (sometimes, with this method, the pita may not puff or may only form a small pocket. Try pressing the surface of the pita gently with a clean towel). Keep baked pita covered with a clean towel while you work on the rest.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, s, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ]"

6401c55c,https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2022/04/best-sourdough-focaccia-bread-recipe/,Beginner's Guide to Sourdough Focaccia Bread,"50-75 g bubbly, active sourdough starter, 375 g water (see Notes below), 20 g honey (optional), 500 g bread flour or all purpose flour (see Notes below), 9 g fine sea salt, 2-3 tbsp olive oil, for coating the pan, Assorted Toppings (optional): rosemary, garlic cloves, flaky seat salt, tomatoes, olives etc., Thoughts on Flour: You can use bread flour or all purpose flour to make sourdough focaccia. Comparatively speaking, bread flour yields a slightly chewier focaccia with a higher rise. All purpose flour creates a more tender focaccia. The choice is up to you. If you prefer to use all purpose flour, I do recommend King Arthur brand. Coming in at over 11.7% protein, this flour is stronger than most all purpose flours, which means it can handle a higher quantity of water without the dough becoming a gloppy mess. It’s actually stronger than most bread flours! If you cannot access this flour, make the following changes to ensure success: decrease the water to 325-350 g (start small and work your way up) OR use King Arthur bread flour with 375 g water instead., Thoughts on Sourdough Starter (quantity): When the weather is cold, I’ll use a higher amount of starter to give the dough a boost when doing a long, overnight rise. I’ve given you a range so you can decide what suits you best., For Baking: You will need a rimmed sheet pan or non-stick rectangular pan (9×13-inch or 10×14-inch)","Make the Dough:, In the evening: whisk the sourdough starter, water and honey together in a large bowl (I use a fork for mixing). Add the flour and salt. Mix to combine and then finish by hand to form a rough dough. It will be wet and sticky. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes to an hour. Timing is flexible here. Then return to the bowl and work the dough into a ball., Bulk Rise, Cover the bowl of dough with lightly oiled plastic wrap (or transfer the dough to a lightly oiled dough container). Let the dough rise overnight at room temperature, approximately 68-70 F (20-21 C) for about 12+ hours. The dough will double in size (or more) when ready. Note: if the weather is warmer than 68- 70 F (20-21 C) the dough will rise faster than 12+ hrs. Please adjust your timeframes accordingly., Second Rise, In the morning, pour 2 tbsp. of olive oil onto a rimmed sheet pan (or 1 tbsp. olive oil if using a non-stick rectangular pan). Use your hands to evenly coat the bottom and sides. With your oiled hands, remove the dough onto the pan, and then flip it to coat both sides. Cover and let rest for 1 1/2- 2 hours or until very puffy (I use an inverted sheet pan to cover the dough). Preheat your oven to 425 F (220 C). Note: I like to rest my dough in a warm spot, usually on top of the oven while it preheats. The dough becomes soft and bubbly., Assemble the Focaccia, Right before baking, gently dimple the dough with oiled fingertips. I start at the bottom of the pan and work my way to the top. As you dimple, the dough will naturally begin to stretch outwards. You should end up with a rustic rectangular or oval shape, about 14 x 9-inches (36 x 23 cm) or larger. The dough won’t go all the way to the corners and sides of the sheet pan- this is OK. Note: If using a rectangular pan, the dough will naturally fill the shape of the pan., Add Focaccia Toppings (optional), Press your preferred toppings into the dough. As the focaccia rises, the dough will puff up. The toppings will pop out if not properly anchored. If using garlic, I keep the cloves wrapped in their papery peels to prevent burning. Remove and discard the peels before eating., Bake the Focaccia, Place the dough onto the center rack. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until crisp and golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack before cutting. TIP: To par-bake focaccia dough: Bake for approximately 15-18 minutes @ 425 F (220 C). The crust will be set, very pale in color and golden underneath. Remove the focaccia from the pan and cool on a wire rack. Once completely cool, wrap in plastic wrap and store at room temperature for up to 6 hrs. To finish, return to the pan and bake for 12-15 minutes., To serve, cut the focaccia into wedges or squares and enjoy warm!","[, (, ', s, o, u, r, d, o, u, g, h,  , s, t, a, r, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 7, 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 3, 7, 5, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', h, o, n, e, y, ', ,,  , 2, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 5, 0, 0, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, i, n, e,  , s, e, a,  , s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 9, ., 0, ,,  , ', g, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, l, i, v, e,  , o, i, l, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, b, s, p, ', ), ]"

Flip the dough upside down, pat into a ball, and place on a piece of parchment paper., (At this point, if you do not plan to bake the bread the same day, you can place it in a bowl, cover it tightly, and refrigerate it overnight, or up to 18 hours. Remove the bread and allow it to come to room temperature, about one hour, before baking)., Cover dough loosely with plastic wrap or a tea towel and allow to rise about 30-45 minutes, until it has reached approximately 1.5 times its size., While the dough is proofing, place dutch oven or other large lidded, oven-proof pot on the middle rack of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees (alternatively, if you are baking in the open oven without a container, place a roasting pan on the bottom rack and add one inch of hot water just before baking the bread)., When the dough is ready to bake, score it.

NOT with the wet ingredients.)","Mix dry ingredients together in large bowl or the bowl of a standing mixer., Add honey and 2 cups water with the mixer on. Let it mix together for a about 1 minute., Gradually add the final cup of water and add more if necessary. The dough should stick to the bottom of the bowl but clean the sides and be sticky to the touch. If you add too much water, don't worry! Just add a bit more flour to get it back to the right consistency., Knead 6-8 minutes in a mixer or 8-10 minutes by hand until the dough is smooth and elastic. Don't skimp on the kneading! This helps create the structure of the bread., Let the dough raise (covered, room temperature) in the same bowl you mixed it in for 1 hour or until doubled., Remove from bowl gently and form into 2 loaves. This is most easily done by creating a crease in the middle of the piece of dough with your palm and then folding the dough over the crease and pinching it together at the bottom, just imagine folding a piece of paper in half and gluing the bottom shut. Repeat this a few times until you have a smooth loaf shape. You may have to tuck the long ends in a few times as well., Place in greased bread loaf pans and raise (covered, room temperature) 1 hour or until doubled., Preheat oven to 375ºF., Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes, remove from oven and brush each loaf with a tablespoon of butter., Return to oven and bake 5-10 more minutes, or until golden brown.

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the water, sugar, and yeast and stir until the yeast is dissolved. Let it sit for 10 minutes or until the mixture begins to froth and rise., 2. When the yeast is foamy and smells like bread, add the milk, yogurt, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and mix the with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together. As soon as it comes together, stop kneading. It should be sticky, but should form a ball and be soft. Cover the bowl with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place 1 hour or if not using right away overnight in the fridge., When ready to cook divide the dough into 8 equal balls and using a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into an oval shape. It should be about 6-8 inches long and about 1/4-inch thick, but no thinner. Repeat this method with the rest of the dough., Warm a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat (you want a hot pan). Brush both sides of the naan with melted butter and if desired sprinkle on any spices you like such as cumin and garlic. Place the naan on the hot skillet, cover with a lid and bake for 1 minute, until you see bubbles starting to form. Flip and cook for 1-2 minutes on the other side, until large toasted spots appear on the underside. Brush with a bit more butter if desired, then sprinkle with a little kosher salt, fresh cilantro (I used cilantro) or other herbs. Place the naan in a tea towel-lined dish.

Stir together and leave for 5 minutes, until foam appears on top of the water., Add the olive oil, flour, sugar, and salt to the yeast mixture., Mix the dough together using either using a stand mixer with a dough hook (recommended) or your hands, until combined., Once combined, knead the dough for 10 minutes using the stand mixer with a dough hook or by hand. The mixture will be quite sticky, so if you’re kneading by hand, it’s a good idea to coat your hands and work surface in a little olive oil to stop it sticking., Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth or clingfilm and allow to prove for 60-90 minutes, until doubled in size., Divide the dough into 12 pieces.

Let this stand until the yeast is dissolved. Gradually add the flour, one cup at a time to the liquid and mix thoroughly until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface to knead. (This may be a little messy, but don't give up!), Knead It: Fold the far edge of the dough back over on itself towards you. Press into the dough with the heels of your hands and push away. After each push, rotate the dough 90°. Repeat this process in a rhythmic, rocking motion for 5 minutes, sprinkling only enough flour on your kneading surface to prevent sticking. Let the dough rest while you scrape out and grease the mixing bowl with a few drops of olive oil (preferred) or non stick baking spray. Knead the dough again for 2 to 3 minutes., Let It Rise: Return the dough to the bowl and turn it over once to grease the top. Cover with a damp towel and keep warm until the dough doubles in bulk, about 1 to 2 hours., Shape it: Punch down the dough with your fist and briefly knead out any air bubbles. Cut the dough in half and shape into two Italian- or French-style loaves. Place the loaves on a cookie sheet generously sprinkled with cornmeal.

That means take 15g starter, 80g flour, and 80g water mix it and let it grow at room temperature., If you'd like more sour bread, you can start earlier., Mix the ingredients and bulk fermentation - The next day, Add bread flour, rye flour, and salt to a bowl. Mix it with your fingers until it's well-distributed., Add 150g of sourdough starter and 500g of water., If you want to, you can mix on a machine until the dough looks nice and cohesive. Then go straight to the rise., Otherwise, mix with your fingers until no dry bits remain. Leave the dough to rest covered for 60 minutes., At this point, you can choose to jump straight to the rise, making it a no-knead bread. Otherwise, you can do three sets of stretch and folds or coil folds spaced out by 30 minutes. Coil folds are best if you are making one loaf., The rise - jump here for machine and no-knead, Put the dough in a see-through container where you can monitor the bulk. Let the dough rise by 25%., DON'T USE TIME!! Time varies on many factors, so go by the rise, not time., If you are bulking cold, below 21°C/70°F, let the dough rise 100%.If you are bulking at room temperature, around 21°C-25°C/70°F, let the dough rise 50%.If you are bulking warm, above 25°C/77°F, let the dough rise 25%., Divide and pre-shape, If you are making one loaf and used coil folds, skip straight to final shaping., Divide the dough into two equally sized pieces by cutting it with your bench scraper. Preshape both pieces of dough into a boule., Let the dough rest on the counter for 20 minutes., Final shape, Final-shape the bread into boules or bâtards, depending on what you prefer. Boules are the easiest, so if you're new, go for that. Watch the video to see how you do both of them., After each dough is shaped, dust a banneton with rice flour and add the dough. Instead of a banneton, you can use a bowl lined with a dish towel. They will, of course, only accommodate boules., Add both bannetons to your fridge. Your fridge should be ice cold. Mine's set to 2°C/35.5°F. Let the bread retard for 4 to 48 hours. You don't have to cover the dough., Bake the bread, Heat your oven to 230°C/450°F with dutch oven inside. Heat for 30 minutes to make sure both are completely saturated with heat., Grab a dough from the fridge. Dust it with rice flour on the bottom and put your peel over the top., Flip it over so the dough rests on the peel. Dust the top with more rice flour and distribute it with your hands. Score the dough., Open the oven and take the top off the dutch oven. Grab the peel and add the dough to the dutch oven., Put the top on, close the oven, and bake for 25 minutes., Prepare the other bread, as above. Then open the oven and take the top off of the dutch oven. Move the bread in the dutch oven to the side, and then add the unbaked bread to the dutch oven., Put the lid on and bake for 25 minutes. Then take out the finished bread and put it on a wire rack., Take the top of the dutch oven and brown the other bread. Then take it out and put it on a wire rack.

Roll each half into a rectangular shape (it does NOT need to be perfect. Look to make the shape about 10″ by 8″. However– I will repeat– it does NOT need to be perfect.), Roll up the rectangle starting with a long side. Pinch the ends of the loaf to seal and shape in a “log.” If your seam doesn’t want to stick down, you might need to dip your finger in a bit of water and moisten the dough to encourage it to adhere. Otherwise, it’ll try to unroll during the baking process., Grease a pizza stone (where to buy) or stoneware baking sheet and place the loaves on it to rise for another 30 minutes., Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees, and prepare an egg wash by beating one egg with one tablespoon of water. (The egg wash is optional– however– it gives the loaves a lovely, shiny brown finish), Right before you pop the loaves into the oven, brush the tops with the egg wash and make 4 diagonal slashes across the top using a sharp, serrated knife., Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.

Fear not. You have the silver cross for this swamp demon., It's called pouring the water mixture into the flour mixture and stir until a raggy, messy dough kind of comes together. It won't be pretty, but it should smell like bread., If you have a mixer with a kneading attachment (Kitchen Aid or Bosch are nice), use that to knead the dough for 5-10 minutes. During the kneading process, you might need to add a few tablespoons of water or flour if the dough is overly dry or wet. Only add a tablespoon of either ingredient at a time in order to avoid a cereal and milk, then more cereal to use up the milk, then more milk because the cereal is too dry, situation., If you're like my family when I was growing up and you like massive forearms, knead the dough by hand. This is easier seen than explained, so do a quick internet search and start making everyone jealous of your toned arms., I demonstrated in the video what the dough should look like when you're done kneading. Basically, if you gently press your finger against it, the dough should spring back until your fingerprint is mostly gone., Smooth the surface of the bread by tucking the edges underneath it until the surface is smooth and dough forms a nice ball. Place it back in the bowl (you can grease the bowl with a little olive oil if you like), cover it with a towel, and let it rise for 30-40 minutes., It won't rise very high the first time.

Cover with a towel and let rise for another hour until doubled in size again., When the dough is close to being doubled in size, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Slash the dough with a sharp knife to create gashes on top. Open the oven and throw a few ice cubes on the bottom when you place the bread in to bake. This will create steam that will make for a great crust to the bread. Bake for 30 minutes until crusty and golden brown.","[, ', (, w, a, t, e, r, ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , c, u, p, ), ', ,,  , ', (, h, o, n, e, y, ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ), ', ,,  , ', (, a, c, t, i, v, e,  , d, r, y,  , y, e, a, s, t, ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, ), ', ,,  , ', (, m, i, l, k, ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , c, u, p, ), ', ,,  , ', (, s, a, l, t, ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, v, e, g, e, t, a, b, l, e,  , o, i, l, ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, b, r, e, a, d,  , f, l, o, u, r, ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , c, u, p, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, w, h, o, l, e,  , w, h, e, a, t,  , f, l, o, u, r, ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , c, u, p, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, d, a, r, k,  , r, y, e,  , f, l, o, u, r, ,,  , 1, ., 5, ,,  , c, u, p, s, ), ', ,,  , ', (, c, a, r, a, w, a, y,  , s, e, e, d, s, ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ), ', ]"
02a68a37,https://venisonfordinner.com/elaines-fluffy-crustless-sandwich-bread/,Homemade Crustless Sandwich Bread,"2 tablespoons butter, 2 cups milk or water (whey, or buttermilk left from butter making will work (but NOT cultured buttermilk)), 1 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 teaspoons active dry OR instant yeast, 4 - 4 1/2 cups all purpose white flour","Melt together the butter and water/milk until the butter is just melted and the milk isn't too hot (it will kill yeast if it's too hot for you to hold your finger in)., In a stand mixer with dough hooks, mix salt, sugar, yeast, and 2 1/2 cups flour., Add in milk/butter to flour mix and beat on medium speed for 2 minutes., Add in 1 1/2 cups flour, and knead until well combined. You want the dough to pull away from the sides of the bowl, NOT stick to it, and be ""soft as a baby's bottom."" If it's not there yet, add in flour a couple tablespoons at a time., Once it's the right consistency, let machine knead for 3-5 minutes until bread hits windowpane stage., Cover mixer bowl and let rise until doubled, about an hour., Get your loaf pans ready - I prefer to line with parchment vs greasing and flouring. It's less work for me. I prefer a smaller sized loaf pan for tall loaves, but two 8""x4"" pans work well., When doubled, dump dough onto a lightly floured counter, divide in two, and shape your loaves., Put your bread pans inside of a plastic bag. I reuse a turkey roaster bag for this but you can even use a grocery bag. Make sure it's inflated with air and tie it off so it stays blown up like a balloon. This creates an excellent ""proofing chamber"" for your bread to rise well., Look at how your dough is now, maybe ""measure"" how tall up the pan the dough is with your fingers like you were measuring 2 fingers of whiskey. For me, it was 3 fingers. This helps me so I can know when the bread is doubled. Letting your bread truly fully double before baking is the trick to this bread being as light and fluffy as can be. It takes about 30-60 min depending on your house temperature., Before the dough is quite doubled, preheat the oven to 350F, with the rack in the middle. NOT CONVECTION. Convection setting actually inhibits your bread from springing up well when baked!, When dough is sufficiently doubled, slide into the oven and set timer for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn pans around. Bake another 5-10 minutes more. (If your oven runs hot, check after 5 minutes.), Because ovens vary, I always suggest taking your bread's internal temperature with an instant read thermometer. It should be over 180F, usually in the area of 190F. If its over 180F you're good, it will continue to rise a bit after you take it out of the oven., When the internal temperature is right, take it out of the oven, leave the loaves in the pans, and set a timer for 10 minutes. When the timer goes off, take the bread out of the pans. This 10 minute rest helps the sides and bottom of the loaves stay softer., If you really want to do this right, take a stick of butter and rub it all over the tops of the bread while it's still warm for the ultimate soft top crust., If you plan to eat the whole loaf in one sitting, you can cut into it while it's still hot. Otherwise let it sit at least an hour, ideally until room temp, until you cut into it. The ""crumb"" of the bread is still setting up and if you cut into it, it releases the steam that's doing so, and causes your bread to get a bit gummier as it cools., Store in a container on bag on the counter. Stays cold sandwich worthy for a good 3 days in our 20C/70F house.","[, (, ', b, u, t, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', m, i, l, k, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 4, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ]"

I like this), 1 egg beaten ((for glazing pre-baked bread))","Dissolve yeast and 1/2 cup of warm water.2. In a separate large bowl, mix 2 cups hot water, sugar, oil, salt and 3 cups of flour.3. Check to make sure your yeast has become frothy/foamy and activated. If so, add hot-water flour mixture. Mix for 2 minutes to incorporate everything well.4. Switch to dough hook attachment and add the remaining 3 cups of flour, one at a time so the dough can absorb all the flour. Let the dough hook mix for 5 minutes until flour is incorporated and dough is smooth and elastic.5. Turn off the mixer and allow the dough to sit for 10 minutes (just leave the dough hook attached and cover the mixer with a tea towel).6. After 10 minutes the dough will look puffy. Stir dough down with a wooden spoon or simply turn on your mixer to low and allow the dough hook to deflate the dough (10 seconds or less). 7. Repeat this step 5 times more so the dough has a total of 60 minutes to rise (and be deflated every 10 minutes). This will allow the gluten to develop and create a wonderful, soft chewy texture.8. Dump dough onto a floured counter top. Cut in half and roll each piece into a roughly 9x12 rectangle. Roll up lengthwise like cinnamon rolls and tuck the ends under. 9. Place loaves onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or sprayed with non-stick spray. You can also bake the loaves separately if you want! 10. Allow your loaves to rise again for 20-30 minutes. About 10 minutes into this rise I like to ""score"" my loaves (use a bread lame or serrated knife). Brush a thin layer of egg wash on the rolls to glaze for a shiny baked finish. This really makes them beautiful!11.

In the bowl of your stand mixer, whisk together bread flour, salt, and instant yeast. In another, whisk together warm water, room temperature eggs, egg yolk, honey, and olive oil., Mix. Pour the wet ingredients into the center of the dry ingredients and let the dough hook mix everything together on low-medium speed, pausing to incorporate flour from the sides of the bowl as needed until the dough comes together in a shaggy mass on the dough hook without any dry bits left in the bottom of the bowl. Be patient, this can take 5-8 minutes, if not more depending on the size of your mixer bowl., Knead. Increase the speed slightly and knead the challah dough for another 5-8 minutes until it is smooth and slightly elastic. It will be slightly tacky, but not sticky to the touch. The dough may cling slightly at the bottom of the bowl, pause and scrape it up every few minutes if needed., Rise. Shape the challah dough into a ball, coat lightly with olive oil, and place back in the mixing bowl. Cover the bowl and rest in a warm spot for 1-2 hours. until doubled in size., Fingerprint Test. After 1 hour, gently press a finger into the dough. If the indentation fills back in slowly but then stops and remains visible, it's ready to shape. If it fills back in immediately and completely, check again every 15 minutes until it's ready. If the dough deflates completely, it has over proofed; knead it back into a ball, cover and rest for 15 minutes, then proceed with the recipe as written., Divide and Pre-Shape. Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces using your kitchen scale (each piece should be about 226 grams). Gently flatten each piece against the counter, stacking any smaller pieces on top of larger ones. Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough into a thick log, pinching the edge to seal the seam at the bottom., Roll Ropes. Starting with the first log of dough, roll each one into a tapered rope about 20 inches long. Try to keep the ""seam"" of the dough against the counter so that it seals shut., Braid. Join the ends of the three ropes of dough together at one end with the middle rope on top of the other two. Pinch to seal and use the heel of a bench scraper to hold them in place. Braid the challah loosely, leaving room for the ropes to expand and fill in during the final rise. Pinch the other end shut, then tuck the each of the two pinched together ends under the loaf and place it on a parchment lined sheet pan., Rise. Lightly spritz the top of the challah with non-stick spray or brush with olive oil, then cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot for 1 hour. During this rise, the challah will double in size and should spring back slightly when you poke it., During the final 30 minutes of the rise time, preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the middle of the oven., Egg Wash. In a small bowl whisk the reserved egg white with water and a pinch of salt. Brush a thin layer of egg white all over the surface of the mini challah, making sure to get the sides, around near the bottom, and into the creases., Bake. Bake in the center of a 350°F oven for 30-35 minutes until golden brown. You're looking for an internal temperature of 195°-200°F., Cool.

I use water straight from the tap, and let it run until it's nice and warm like a baby's bath. If it feels so hot that you want to pull your finger away, it's too hot. If you want to bust out the thermometer, we're looking for a temperature between 105-110 degrees F., Add 2 tablespoons instant yeast* to the water. Add 1/3 cup sugar to the water. Stir this together and wait a minute or two, to make sure that your yeast is starting to bubble. See photos. You don't need to wait a long time, you just want to make sure the yeast is starting to bloom (and that you didn't kill it with too-hot water) Once you see any measure of foaming or bubbling, move to the next step. (If the water is flat and unmoving, ya done killed it. Toss it and start again.), Add 3 tablespoons oil. Add 1/2 cup vital wheat gluten. (If you don't have vital wheat gluten, use bread flour in it's place.), Add 7 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt. Yes you read that right. 7 teaspoons. (If you do not have kosher salt, add 4 teaspoons table salt. If you have Morton's coarse kosher salt, use 5 teaspoons.), Use a cup to add bread flour to a 1 cup measuring cup. Level off the top and add it to the bowl. Repeat. Add 6 cups total bread flour to the bowl with the yeast., If you are using a stand mixer,***** use the dough hook and mix on medium low speed until the flour is mostly incorporated. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula and continue mixing with the hook on low speed. Add the remaining 1/4 cup flour as the dough mixes, if necessary (see next step)., At this point you need to decide if you should add more flour to your dough or not. You do not want to add too much flour or your dough will be stiff and your bread too heavy. If you don't have enough flour, your bread won't rise well. You want your dough to be smooth, elastic, and slightly sticky. If you need more flour, add it a few tablespoons at a time. This dough will NOT QUITE form into a ball in the mixer. It is pretty tacky. Do not over flour. If you reach your finger in and press the dough, your finger should come away glossy but with no dough stuck to it. But if you take two fingers and pinch it harder, you will have dough stuck to your fingers., Once all the flour has been added, continue kneading for a total time of at least 5-6 minutes., Spray two 9x5 inch loaf pans with nonstick spray. Grease them really well! Rub with oil if you don't have nonstick spray., Remove the dough hook and scrape the dough onto a work surface lightly sprayed with nonstick spray, or you can use a lightly floured surface like a pastry cloth., Use a serrated knife to split the dough in half., Gently pat one half of the dough into a rectangle that is about the length of your loaf pan, about 9x5 inches. Roll up the long end of the dough to form a loaf, and pinch the edges together, smoothing as best you can. Lift the dough from the ends, folding them slightly underneath, and place your dough baby in the loaf pan. Your loaf should be nice and smooth on top. Repeat with the other half of dough., Spray the top of the dough with non stick spray and cover with plastic wrap that you have also coated with nonstick spray. You do not want your dough sticking to the plastic, it will ruin your beautiful rise!, Turn your oven on to 350 and set a timer for 30 seconds. Turn the oven off when it is nice and warm inside, but not hot. You should still be able to comfortably place your fingers on the oven rack. Place your two pans of covered dough in the oven and shut the door. Set a timer for 15 minutes. (If your oven got too hot because you turned it on for too long (literally this is the story of my life), leave the oven door open, place a hot pad on top of the open door, and place the bread pans on top. Make sure there are no toddlers running around who like to climb inside hot ovens.), After 15 minutes of rising in the warm oven, remove the pans to another warm spot in your kitchen. The top of the fridge is a good spot, or on top of the preheating oven. Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F., Let the oven preheat and the dough continue rising for another 10-15 minutes, or longer if necessary (this depends on a number of variables, kitchen temperature being one.) You will know your dough is ready for the oven when the tops have risen at least 1 inch above the edge of the pan. They should look puffy and dome-y. A technical term.******, Remove the plastic wrap and bake at 350 F for 25-30 minutes. You will know the bread is done when it is brown on top, and the edge of the bread is pulling away from the pan. I always use a thermometer to check my bread; this bread should measure about 200 degrees F in the center. The bottom and sides of the bread should be brown., Place the two bread pans on a cooling rack and let sit for about 1 minute. Then, with a hot pad on each hand, place one hand on the bottom of the pan, one hand on the top of your loaf, and invert. The bread should come right out of the pan, if not, loosen sides with a butter knife.*******, This step is optional, but now is a good time to butter the top of your loaves if you like. It adds a ton of delicious, buttery flavor, but it will wrinkle the top of your loaf. You can try buttering one loaf and leaving the other to see which way you prefer!, Place the loaf on a cooling rack on it's side to cool. (this helps the risen bread stay nice and tall; bread is naturally a little top-heavy). Repeat with the other loaf. Let the loaves cool completely; at least 30 minutes to an hour. (I know, I know), Slice with a serrated knife, using a sawing motion and being careful not to smash the bread. Serve with lots of butter and jam! I love to toast mine first., How to Store: Store the loaves of bread in gallon ziplock bags, or you can fit both loaves into a 2-gallon ziplock. I like to leave my loaves unsliced (slice as needed) to keep them from getting dried out. Your bread will keep on the counter for up to 2 days. I'm always shocked at how quickly homemade bread goes moldy; we are all accustomed to store bread with lots of preservatives. Don't forget about it! If you won't eat it on day 1 or 2, freeze it., Freezing instructions: Bread freezes beautifully. If you are not planning to eat the bread right away, freeze it as soon as possible after cooling. Thawed out frozen bread is just as fresh as the moment you froze it (for a few months, anyway.) You can slice all the bread before freezing to make it easy to thaw just what you need for a slice of morning toast, or you can freeze it as a loaf., If you have a slice of frozen bread, you can place it frozen into your toaster on a low setting. Toast it twice on low, or as many times as you need to thaw it/ toast it., Traditional 1-hour rise method: Most bread recipes have a 1-hour rise in a bowl before the dough is shaped into loaves. The special ingredients in this recipe allow us to skip this rise and still get tender, fluffy, puffy bread. But the longer amount of time yeast has to ferment before baking, the more flavor you will have. If you want extra flavorful bread and have time, follow the recipe as written, but allow the dough to rise in the bowl for 1 hour after kneading. Then continue with shaping the loaves. No other changes., Overnight instructions: You can let this bread rise overnight in the fridge. Reduce the yeast to 1 tablespoon, otherwise make the dough as instructed. Place in a large covered bowl in the fridge. Let chill for 8-12 hours, keeping an eye on it toward the end to make sure it doesn't overflow. Divide the dough, shape into loaves, and let rise at least 1 hour (possibly more), until they are room temperature and have risen well above the edge of the pan. Bake as directed.","[, (, ', w, a, t, e, r, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', y, e, a, s, t, ', ,,  , 2, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, u, g, a, r, ', ,,  , 1, ., 0, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', o, i, l, ', ,,  , 3, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, a, b, l, e, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', g, l, u, t, e, n, ', ,,  , 0, ., 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, ', ), ,,  , (, ', s, a, l, t, ', ,,  , 7, ., 0, ,,  , ', t, e, a, s, p, o, o, n, s, ', ), ,,  , (, ', f, l, o, u, r, ', ,,  , 6, ., 2, 5, ,,  , ', c, u, p, s, ', ), ]"
