I like to do this by placing milk in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving it for 40-45 seconds. It should be like warm bath water.

Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form., Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it's TOO sticky (meaning it's sticking to the bottom of the mixer, add in 2 tablespoons more bread flour.) If you don’t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface., Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel.

OR, you can mix early morning, about 7:30 a.m., and leave to bulk ferment on the counter for 6-8 hours until doubled in size, plan to shape/bake that evening about 4:00 p.m., Mixing, Add white flour to large container or bowl., Add and mix Italian Herbs with the flour., Add warm water (90-100 F degrees)., Mix together until no dry flour remains and you have a rough dough., Cover dough and set aside for 30 minutes to allow the flour to autolyze (absorb the moisture)., After 30 minutes, uncover the dough and sprinkle the top evenly with the sea salt and the yeast., Pull outside edge of dough and fold over center, do this 4-6 times until yeast and salt are enclosed., Using two fingers (like you are making the ""OK"" symbol) cut through the dough 3 times., Pull outside edge of dough up, it will not stretch much at this point, and fold over center again, 4-6 times., Repeat the last two steps two more times until the salt and yeast are evenly distributed., Turn the dough over so the last folds you made are tucked under a loose ball. This dough will need to be folded 3-4 times over the next 1.5-2 hours., Cover the dough and allow to rest for 10 minutes., Uncover the dough and perform another fold by pulling the outside edge of the dough upwards, being careful not to tear the dough and folding over the center, 4-6 times., Hint: Every time you fold this dough it will gain elasticity, strength and rise. Pull the dough up and over to achieve maximum stretch without tearing it, this builds the structure to hold the developing carbon dioxide gas., Turn the dough over so the last folds you made are tucked under a loose ball., Wait 30 minutes and perform the last two steps again. You will do this two more times for a total of four folds., Hint: These folds can be done every 30 minutes or longer., Bulk Fermentation (first rise), After 3-4 folds, allow dough to rest until doubled in size, overnight in the refrigerator, or 6 hours at room temperature. My preferred method is to place this dough in the refrigerator overnight to slow the rise which develops flavor.Hint: Using a clear container allows you to easily see when the dough has risen to double its original size. Mark the outside of the container with a marker or elastic at the desired point., Punching/Folding, In the morning, pull the dough from the refrigerator, it should have doubled overnight. If not, leave it at room temperature until doubled. When dough has doubled in size it will be lofty with good structure, bubbles on top and inside. Flour a work surface and gently dump dough out. This will achieve ""punching"" the dough down, or expelling some of the carbon dioxide gas that developed during Bulk Fermentation stage., Dividing, This recipe makes 4 mini rounds. Divide the dough in half and then in half again. Flour a line down the short center of the dough and gently pushing a bench scraper or knife through to divide the dough in two. Divide these two halves again for a total of 4 pieces, about 220-240 gram each. Continue with next step., Next, pull outside edges of each piece of dough up (no need to stretch here) and fold over center, 4-6 times., Pre-shaping or Rounding, Flip dough over so folds are tucked under a loose ball. Repeat until you have 4 loose balls., Bench Proofing or Resting, Cover the loose balls with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and allow to rest for 5-10 minutes., Prepare the flat baking pan with parchment sprayed lightly with oil., Makeup and Panning, Uncover the dough balls. Tighten them into a round ball. To do that, cup hand around the rear of the round shape and drag the dough towards you on the work surface. Turn the dough a quarter of a turn. Gently pick the dough up and place it further away from you again. Repeat four times or as many times as it takes to create a tightly rounded dough ball. Hint: You will need a little friction to drag the dough ball to tighten it into a round. If there is no friction, clear the work surface of the majority of flour and try again., Once you have four tight dough balls, flour the tops. Pick each one up by gently sliding cupped hands under either side of the ball., Gently lay the balls onto the parchment paper allowing space for them to double. Cover with plastic wrap or a linen towel., Proofing (second rise), If you want to bake that morning, set the dough balls aside in a warm place to proof. Allow the dough balls to rise until it has relaxed and doubled in size. This may take 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the room temperature. Hint: If you prefer to bake later in the day, return the formed dough balls on the tray back to the refrigerator for a cold proof. This will take 8 hours. They can be removed from the refrigerator and baked right away once they have doubled in size., Baking, Approximately 30 minutes prior to baking, put a metal cake pan filled with very cold water into your oven to create steam. Set oven temp to 460 F degrees. Set timer for 30 minutes., When timer buzzes, check that your dough balls are doubled.Hint: To check if your dough has risen enough, you can perform the poke test. Poke the dough with a floured finger. If the indent springs back quickly, it is not yet ready to be baked. Allow it to continue to rise. If the indent springs back slowly, it is ready to be baked. If the indent does not spring back at all, it is over-proofed., If your dough is doubled, using kitchen sheers, cut an ""X"" pattern onto the top of each dough ball, being careful not to deflate the dough. Place pan with dough balls in oven to bake.Hint: If the water has boiled away, fill the cake pan again., Bake at 460 F degrees for 25-30 minutes, turn pan half way through baking., Hint: The darker the outside caramelization is on the crust, the more flavor your bread will have. I personally like to bake it to a very rich golden brown., Cooling, Remove the sheet pan with loaves and set on a heat proof surface., Immediately set bread on a cooling rack to allow air flow around the bread. Allow to cool at least 15 minutes, preferably 30 minutes, before slicing.Hint: I know it's hard to wait for that yummy first piece! However, the crumb needs time to cool so it does not get crushed when you try to cut the bread., Storing, If you do not use this bread immediately, it can be stored in the open air for 8 hours, or even overnight, as long as it is not cut., Once the bread has been cut, allow it to cool completely.

Then cover the bowl fully with plastic wrap., REST DOUGH: Leave the dough covered at room temperature (around 70°F or 21°C) for a minimum of 10 hours and a maximum of 18 hours.Leave the dough on the counter, free of draft. After the dough has risen for the desired amount of time, it should have more than doubled in size and be covered in small bubbles. It is now ready to be shaped and baked., PREP TO BAKE: Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Place the oven rack in the center of the oven. Place a 5.5-quart cast iron pot in the oven and heat it for 30 minutes before baking the bread., SHAPE: Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of flour on a clean work surface. Scrape all of the dough out of the bowl onto the flour using a spatula. Sprinkle 1 more tablespoon of flour on top of the dough.Use the spatula or a dough scraper to gently fold the sides of the dough inwards, making a total of 6 folds, to form a rough ball shape. Do not knead the dough; the ball does not need to be perfect.Set out a large piece of parchment paper (See Note 4) next to the dough ball. Use the spatula or dough scraper to gently transfer the ball to the parchment paper, flipping it upside down so that the seam sides are down and touching the paper. Slide the ball to the middle of the paper and press in the sides to gently shape it into a rough ball. (Optional: If you have a lamé, score the top of the dough ball 3-5 times using the tool.), BAKE: Working quickly, carefully pull the preheated pot from the oven, remove the lid, and lift the parchment paper with the dough ball up and into the pot. Drizzle the top of the bread with remaining 1 tbsp. olive oil and a light sprinkle of sea salt flakes if using. Cover the pot with the lid and bake for 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, keep the pot in the oven, but remove the lid and continue to bake for an additional 12-20 minutes, or until the bread sounds hollow when tapped in the middle and is a deep golden brown on top., COOL: After the bread has finished baking, carefully remove it from the pot, holding the sides of the parchment paper. Slide the bread off the paper and onto a wire cooling rack. Let the bread cool for 30 minutes. During this time, the steam from the bread will continue to cook it (See Note 5).Once the bread has cooled for 30 minutes, transfer it to a cutting board. Use a very sharp serrated knife to cut the bread. It is difficult to cut through the bottom crust without a sharp knife., STORAGE: On the first day, leave the bread out, uncovered, with the cut side down on a cutting board. This helps to keep the crust crisp without drying out the inside of the bread. After the first day, store the bread in an airtight container or bag. The bread may lose some of its crispy texture when stored this way, but it will still be delicious when toasted. To enjoy the bread after it has been stored, simply toast it as desired. The bread will taste great even if it has lost some of its original crispiness.","[('garlic', 2, 'teaspoons'), ('rosemary', 1.5, 'tablespoons'), ('thyme', 1.5, 'tablespoons'), ('black pepper', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('instant yeast', 2, 'teaspoons'), ('honey', 2, 'teaspoons'), ('water', 1.5, 'cups'), ('flour', 3, 'cups'), ('sea salt', 1.75, 'teaspoons'), ('olive oil', 1.17, 'tablespoons')]"

Divide dough into 7 equal pieces (I like to weigh the dough to try and get exactly equal-sized pieces). Form each piece into a ball., Brush a 6-inch x 2-inch high round cake pan generously with some of the Garlic Herb Infused Olive Oil. Place balls into the pan, placing 6 balls evenly around the outside and 1 ball in the centre. *Alternately, you can use an 8-inch round baking pan, placing the balls the same way, but there will be space between each and the dough will rise out to fill the space, rather than up. Another option is to use an 8x4-inch-ish loaf pan. Make 8 balls instead of 7, then place the balls into the greased loaf pan in 2 rows of 4 rolls., Cover baking pan with plastic wrap or a clean tea towel and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes., Preheat oven to 400F. (not fan-assisted), When rolls have risen, remove plastic wrap. Brush the tops of the rolls generously with Garlic Herb Infused Oil. Sprinkle tops with some coarse salt., Bake in preheated oven to 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375F and bake an additional 15 minutes more. Check rolls and assuming they are already well-browned, place a piece of aluminum foil loosely over-top of the rolls, to prevent over-browning. If they aren't at risk of over-browning, you don't need to cover with foil. Bake an additional 8-10 minutes or until the internal temperature when tested in the centre is at least 200F. *Be sure to bake the full time. Even if they look done earlier, the centre of the round may still be quite moist. Err on the side of over-baking rather than under baking, covering with foil as needed to prevent over-browning., Remove from oven and immediately remove from the baking pan to a cooling rack to cool until just warm. You can also let cool completely and re-warm later by wrapping the whole round of rolls in foil and placing into a 350F oven until just warmed., The baked rolls will freeze well.","[('olive oil', 0.25, 'cup'), ('herbs', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('garlic', 2.0, 'cloves'), ('water', 1.0, 'cup'), ('yeast', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('salt', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('flour', 2.5, 'cups')]"

Do not add the salt yet.Use a large spoon or dough whisk to stir the dough together, or use the paddle attachment on your stand mixer to mix on medium-speed for about 60 seconds. Mix until the dough no longer clings to the bowl, and instead forms a ball.Allow the dough to rest about 20 minutes, and then add the salt., Incorporate the salt by mixing again with the spoon, whisk, or stand mixer until just mixed. You may need to use your fingers to help work the salt into the dough until you don't feel the salt crystals anymore.Place the dough in a non-reactive bowl (such as glass or Pyrex), and cover the dough with a damp towel. Allow to rise for one hour., Spritz a work surface with water and dampen your hands and (optionally) a flexible dough scraper.Gently move the dough onto the work surface. Using your hands or the dough scraper, spread the dough slightly and then fold the dough like a letter. (I fold the upper third down towards the center and then the bottom third up towards the center.), Fold the sides of the dough in. (I fold the right third in towards the center and the left third in towards the center.)Flip the dough and repeat the stretching and folding process on the other side., Return the dough to the bowl, cover, and allow to rise for another hour.Repeat the rest and fold period two more times (for a total of 3 hours).On the third folding, add the herbs, garlic powder and nutritional yeast (if using) by folding it into the dough. Spread the dough slightly and then sprinkle half the herbs, garlic and nutritional yeast across the dough. Fold it like a letter, flip the dough, and spread it out again. Sprinkle the remaining herbs, garlic and yeast over the dough. Fold the dough one more time., Return the dough to the bowl and cover with a fitted lid, damp towel, or with plastic wrap.Do one of the following proofing methods (not both):Proof Refrigerated (Preferred Method): Place the dough in the fridge and proof for at least 8 hours, or up to 2 days (48 hours). If you used a towel (instead of plastic wrap) to cover the bowl, re-dampen the towel occasionally. Proof Unrefrigerated: (Only proof unrefrigerated if your kitchen is around 70°F or cooler). Place the dough out of direct sunlight on your counter and allow it to rise for about 8 hours, more or less, depending on the temperature. Check the bread to see if it's finished proofing by pressing the dough with a lightly floured or oiled knuckle. If the dough springs right back, allow it to keep proofing. If it's slow to spring back, it's ready., Day 2: Finish Proofing + Bake, Dampen a work surface and your hands.Gently turn the dough out onto the work surface. Form the dough into a ball, place it seam-side up, and cover with a damp towel. Allow the dough to rest for about 15 minutes.Next, use dampened hands to roll the dough into a round ball. Place the dough on parchment paper., If you proofed your dough in the fridge: Leave the dough to rise at room temperature until it's no longer cold (about 2½ to 3 hours).If you proofed your dough at room temperature: Leave the dough to rest on the parchment paper while the oven pre-heats, and then you can go ahead and bake., About 30 minutes before you're ready to bake, pre-heat your oven to 480°F. If using a non-enameled pot, place the pot in the oven during the pre-heat.Just before baking, lightly dust the dough with flour, and then use a bread lame or a floured knife to score the bread. (Scoring will give steam an outlet and will prevent the bottom of the loaf from cracking.)Scoring can be as simple as one or two long lines across the top. If desired, you can create a pattern while scoring for a more decorative final loaf., If you pre-heated the Dutch oven, remove it carefully from the oven. Place the parchment paper and dough into the Dutch oven. Lightly spritz the dough with water, and then add the Dutch oven lid. Slide bread into the pre-heated oven.Lower the oven temperature to 450°F.Bake the bread for 45 minutes covered, and then remove the Dutch oven lid and bake uncovered another 10 to 15 minutes, until the center of the loaf is 210°F. If you don't have a digital thermometer, you can try gently knocking on the bottom of the loaf to see if it sounds hollow., Use a spatula, tongs or the edges of the parchment paper to move the bread onto a cooling rack.Wait at least 2 hours before cutting into the loaf. It will be tempting to cut it earlier, but the bread is still baking internally. Cutting early will result in an under-cooked loaf.Store the bread lightly wrapped on the countertop for up to 4 days, or wrap tightly and freeze up to 3 months. I recommend slicing the bread before freezing, so that you can thaw individual slices if desired. Thaw frozen slices by toasting or heating over low heat on a stovetop griddle or pan.","[('sourdough starter', 1.0, 'cup'), ('bread flour', 5.0, 'cups'), ('water', 1.75, 'cups'), ('salt', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('garlic powder', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('dried rosemary', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('nutritional yeast', 0.25, 'cup')]"

Or, if you do not own a stand mixer, a regular large mixing bowl. Heat the milk on the stove or in the microwave until warm to touch, about 110°F (43°C). Pour warm milk on top of yeast/sugar. Whisk gently to combine, then loosely cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow to sit for 5-10 minutes. The mixture will be frothy after 5-10 minutes., If you do not have a mixer, you can mix the dough together with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in this step, Add the butter, egg, flour, salt, garlic powder, and rosemary. Beat on low speed for 3 minutes. Dough will be soft., Knead the dough:, Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if using the paddle) and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st Rise, Shape the kneaded dough into a ball. Place the dough in a greased bowl (I use nonstick spray to grease) and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place in a slightly warm environment to rise until doubled in size, around 60-90 minutes. (If desired, use my warm oven trick for rising. See my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), As the dough rises, prepare the filling in the next step and grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan., Make the filling, In a medium bowl, mix the soft butter, rosemary, parsley, garlic, and salt together. If the butter is soft enough, you can just mix it all together with a spoon or fork. You can use an electric mixer if that’s easier too. Cover tightly and set aside until ready to use. (Don’t refrigerate unless making well in advance. It’s easiest to spread on the dough when at room temperature. If refrigerated, let it come to room temperature before spreading on dough pieces.), Assemble the bread:, Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface. Divide it into 12 equal pieces, each about 1/4 cup of dough and a little larger than a golf ball. Using lightly floured hands, flatten each into a circle that’s about 4 inches in diameter. The circle doesn’t have to be perfectly round. I do not use a rolling pan to flatten, but you certainly can if you want. Spread 1-2 teaspoons of filling mixture onto each. Sprinkle each with 1 Tablespoon of cheese. Fold circles in half and line in prepared baking pan, round side up. See photos above for a visual., truction-step-8"">2nd Rise, 2nd Rise, Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rise once again in a slightly warm environment until puffy, about 45 minutes., Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position then preheat oven to 350°F (177°C)., Bake until golden brown, about 50 minutes. If you find the top of the loaf is browning too quickly, tent with aluminum foil. (Don’t be alarmed if there’s melted butter around the sides of the bread as it bakes, it will seep into the bread before it finishes.) Remove from the oven and place the pan on a wire rack. If desired, brush with melted butter for topping and sprinkle with sea salt., Cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then remove from the pan and serve warm., Cover and store leftovers at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Take your hands grab the corners of one side of the dough and gently stretch it out. The dough should be fairly easy to stretch., Continue to stretch the dough with wet hands until you have a rectangle about 18×24″/45x60cm. It does not have to be perfect just focus on making it even and not tearing the dough., Use a dough scraper to flip the dough out of the bowl onto your workbench.

Using the dough scraper, lift up one side, stretching just a bit up and over to the middle, then fold up the other side, like a tri-fold envelope. You want the dough to be inbetween the filling so all the filling is not in one area. (See notes) Turn the dough horizontally. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Then repeat.

Cover and leave to sit for around an hour., Tip the dough out onto a clean surface and knead it until the dough is soft and supple. You can do this step in a stand mixer or Thermomix if you prefer. It will take around 10 minutes to knead by hand and around 5 minutes in a stand mixer., Place the kneaded dough back into a bowl and cover. Allow it to rise around 50%., While the dough is rising, make the filling for the dough so that it is ready to go when you need it. Simple chop all the herbs and garlic really finely (so that it's like minced herbs) and then add the herbs and parmesan cheese to the butter. Mix until well combined. You can do this in a food processor if you prefer. Set aside., Once the dough has risen a bit, tip it out onto a clean surface and gently shape it into a rectangle with the long edge in front of you. You're looking for a rectangle of around 25"" x 8"" (64 x 20 cm). Don't be afraid of degassing the dough as it will puff up in the next stage., Now spread the herb and garlic filling all over the dough, leaving a 1"" strip at the top with no filling., Roll the dough up into a big log - just like you would if you were making cinnamon rolls. Make sure it's rolled fairly tightly. Seal the dough up along the seam and roll it over so that the seam is at the bottom., Using a knife or dough scraper, cut the log through the middle all the way up, leaving just a small part of the dough attached so you have two strands. You will be able to see the swirls of garlic and herb butter where you have sliced it (refer to step by step photos in the blog above for visual aids on how to do this)., Now, twist the two strands of dough together to form a ""rope"". Gently push the ends together so that both ends of the rope are sealed. My rope was around 30"" (76 cm) long when I finished (the dough does stretch a bit)., Now form the rope into a letter ""S"" curling each end in towards the middle. This forms your twist. You can see how I've done this in the photos further up the page., Place your sourdough herb and garlic twist onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper, cover with a damp dishtowel and allow to proof for a few hours. You want your dough to be nice a puffy before you bake it., Once the dough has proofed, preheat the oven to 200C (392F) and bake for around 40 minutes or until golden. I recommend placing your twist on the lower shelf to avoid it burning. If your oven is fan forced or it runs hot, reduce this to temp to 180C (356F)., When the twist is cooked, remove it from the oven. Be careful if your baking tray has no sides as some of the butter may drip over the sides., Brush the finished bake with excess butter and serve warm.","[('sourdough starter', 100.0, 'g'), ('bread flour', 500.0, 'g'), ('salt', 8.0, 'g'), ('butter', 50.0, 'g'), ('milk', 200.0, 'g'), ('water', 50.0, 'g'), ('garlic', 3.0, 'cloves'), ('parmesan cheese', 50.0, 'g'), ('salted butter', 100.0, 'g'), ('fresh herbs', 1.0, 'bunch')]"

Add the flours and salt. Combine to form a stiff dough, then finish mixing by hand to fully incorporate the flour. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes., Add the Fillings: After the dough has rested, add the olives, thyme, lemon zest and parmesan cheese (if using) to the bowl. Gently knead the fillings into the dough, using the stretch and fold technique, To do this: stretch the dough upward and fold it over toward the center of the bowl. Give the dough a turn and repeat (stretching, folding and turning) until the fillings are tucked into the dough., Bulk Rise: Cover the bowl with lightly coated plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until double in size. This will take about 8 to 10 hours at 70 F (21 C). Note: if making the dough in the summer, the rise time will be considerably less; bulk rise during the day and chill the whole bowl overnight when almost double in size. Optional Step: If you’d like, for added structure, do 1-2 sets of stretch and folds during the bulk rise, spaced 30 minutes apart., Shape: Remove the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Shape it into a round or oval and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, line a proofing basket with a towel and dust with flour. With floured hands, gently cup the dough and pull it toward you to tighten its shape. Then place the dough into your basket, seam side up., Second Rise: Cover the dough and let rest until noticeably puffy but not fully risen, about 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on temperature. Alternatively, chill the dough overnight, up to 8 hours. Let rest at room temperature while the oven heats up before baking. Preheat your oven to 450 F (230 C). Cut a sheet of parchment paper to fit the size of your baking pot., Score: Place the parchment over the dough and invert the basket to release. Sprinkle the dough very lightly with flour and rub the surface to coat. Make one long, off-center cut down the length of the loaf using a small knife or razor blade. Use the parchment to transfer the dough into the baking pot., Bake the dough on the center rack for 20 minutes, covered. Remove the lid, and continue to bake for 30 minutes.

Make the biga: Stir together the flour and yeast in a 4-quart bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add ¾ cup plus 2 Tablespoons of water, stirring until everything comes together and makes a coarse ball (or mix on low speed for 1 minute with the paddle attachment). Adjust the flour or water, according to need, so that the dough is neither too sticky nor too stiff. (It is better to err on the sticky side, as you can adjust easier during kneading. It is harder to add water once the dough firms up.), Sprinkle some flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Knead for 4 to 6 minutes (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook for 4 minutes), or until the dough is soft and pliable, tacky but not sticky.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for 2 to 4 hours, or until it nearly doubles in size., Remove the dough from the bowl, knead it lightly to degas, and return it to the bowl, covering the bowl with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the refrigerator overnight. You can keep this in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or freeze it in an airtight plastic bag for up to 3 months., 2. Remove the biga from the refrigerator 1 hour before you plan to make the bread. Cut it into about 10 small pieces with a pastry scraper or serrated knife. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour to take off the chill., 3. Stir together the flour, salt, black pepper, and yeast into a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer).

Sprinkle flour on the counter, transfer the dough to the counter, and begin to knead (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Knead for approximately 10 minutes (or 6 minutes by machine), adding more flour if needed, until the dough is soft and supple, tacky but not sticky. It should pass the windowpane test and register 77° to 81°F. Flatten the dough and spread the roasted garlic over the top. Gather the dough into a ball and knead it by hand for 1 minute (you will probably have to dust it with flour first to absorb the moisture from the garlic). Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap., 5. Ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size., 6. Remove the dough from the bowl and divide it into 2 equal pieces for loaves, or 18 equal pieces (about 2 ounces each) for dinner rolls. Shape each of the larger pieces into a boule, or shape the smaller pieces into rolls. Line a sheet pan with baking parchment (use 2 pans for rolls) and dust lightly with semolina flour or cornmeal. Place the dough on the parchment, separating the pieces so that they will not touch, even after they rise. Mist the dough with spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap., 7.

Stir until no dry bits of flour are left., Put the lid back on the starter jar and mark the top of the starter with a rubber band so that you can see how much it grows overnight., Let the starter rise at room temperature overnight, or for about 6-8 hours. It should double in size and be ready to use the next morning., Preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C). Take one head of garlic and remove the outer papery layers, leaving the individual cloves intact., Place all of the garlic cloves in a small baking dish and pour enough olive oil over the garlic to cover it completely., Move the baking dish to the oven and let the garlic cook slowly for about 2 1/2 hours, or until the garlic is soft and caramelized. Remove the garlic from the oven and let it cool., Now you’ve got plenty of soft and caramelized garlic cloves, and a beautiful, garlic-infused olive oil. You’ll use both to flavor this sourdough bread!, In a mixing bowl, combine 300g water, 10g salt, and 100g active sourdough starter. Stir the mixture until the salt is dissolved and the starter is evenly distributed., Add 450g bread flour to the mixture and stir until a shaggy dough forms.Once the ingredients have formed a rough dough, add 25 grams of olive oil right on top of the dough. You can use the garlic-infused olive oil that you made in the previous step when cooking the garlic., Squeeze the oil into the dough with your hands for a few minutes so that the flour starts to absorb the oil. The dough will still feel slightly oily but that’s OK., Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or a sheet of plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. This short rest period will help the dough hold together better when you are doing the stretch and folds in the next step., After 30 minutes, uncover the dough and perform a set of stretch and folds. To do this, take an edge of the dough, stretch it up and fold it over the center of the dough. Repeat with the other edges, going around the bowl until you have completed about 30 stretch and folds. The dough will become smoother and easier to handle. Cover the dough and let it rest for another 30 minutes., After 30 minutes, uncover the dough and place half of the roasted garlic cloves on top of the dough. Press the garlic into the dough with your fingertips. Then, sprinkle a few shakes (probably two teaspoons) of dried rosemary on top of the dough., To incorporate the garlic and rosemary into the dough, perform a second set of stretch and folds. This will gently fold the garlic and rosemary into the dough in layers. Cover the dough and let it rest for another 30 minutes., After the 30 minute rest, add the remaining garlic cloves and a few sprinkles of dried rosemary on top of the dough. Perform one last set of stretch and folds to incorporate the garlic and rosemary into the dough., After the third set of stretch and folds, move the dough into an oiled glass container with a lid and let it rise at room temperature for 4-6 hours, or until it is roughly doubled in size., When the dough has doubled in size, you can move on to the preshape step., Take the dough out of the glass bowl and place it seam side down onto a clean kitchen counter., Gently shape the dough with your hands into a smooth ball and let it rest on the counter for 30 minutes. During this rest period the dough will relax and it will be easier to shape the dough into an oval later., After the 30 minute rest, flip the dough over onto a lightly floured counter. Now, the sticky side should be facing up and the smooth side should be against the floured counter., Gently flatten the dough and stretch it into a square. Fold the right third of the dough over the middle third of the dough, and then fold the left third of the dough over the middle third as well. Press down the seam where the two sides meet., Take the far end of the dough and start rolling it towards yourself until the dough forms a tight cylinder. The dough should now be in a typical oval or loaf shape., Prepare an oval-shaped banneton basket with a liberal dusting a rice flour or bread flour., Transfer the dough into the banneton basket upside down, so that the seam is facing up. Cover basket with a kitchen towel and let the dough rise at room temperature for about 2 hours., At the end of the proofing time, the dough should have grown significantly and it will feel puffy to the touch., When the dough is almost done proofing, preheat your oven to 500°F (around 260°C) for 30 minutes with a Dutch oven inside., When the oven is preheated, flip the dough out of the banneton basket onto a sheet of parchment paper. Dust of any excess flour that is still on top of the dough., Score a long slash into the top of the dough with a razor blade or bread lame. You can also score two curved score marks into the dough like I show you in the video., Transfer the scored dough carefully into the hot Dutch oven, lifting at each end of the parchment paper. It’s OK for the parchment paper to remain under the dough while it’s baking., Bake the bread for 20 minutes with the Dutch oven lid on to trap the steam.After 20 minutes, remove the lid from the Dutch oven to release the steam, and admire how much your bread has puffed up! That’s called oven spring and it’s beautiful., Continue baking the bread for 12-15 more minutes with the lid off. Take the bread out of the oven when it reaches the desired color that you’re looking for., Transfer the bread to a wire rack to cool for at least one hour before slicing., Once your bread is cool, you can slice into it and enjoy the taste of roasted garlic and rosemary., The roasted garlic cloves show up in little pockets throughout the dough, so they’re not in every single bite of this bread, but thanks to the garlic-infused olive oil in the dough, the whole loaf is permeated with the delicious smell and taste of garlic. It’s not too much, either, it’s just right. The rosemary is also a perfect pairing to the garlicky flavor.","[('roasted garlic', 100, 'grams'), ('water', 300, 'grams'), ('salt', 10, 'grams'), ('sourdough starter', 100, 'grams'), ('bread flour', 450, 'grams'), ('olive oil', 25, 'grams'), ('dried rosemary', 3, 'grams')]"

Add the water and stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture is uniformly moist, without any patches of flour. The dough should be sticky and conform to the shape of the bowl. If your dough is too dry, add a few tablespoons more warm water. If it's too wet, add a few tablespoons of flour. (See the step-by-step photos for guidance on what the dough should look like.) Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and let it sit on the counter in a warm spot for 2 hours. If you plan to bake a loaf immediately, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, place the bowl of dough in the refrigerator to be used over the next 14 days. (Once refrigerated, the dough will shrink back a bit; that's okay. Do not punch down the dough at any point, and keep it loosely covered with plastic wrap.), Dust a sturdy baking sheet with cornmeal., Dust the surface of the dough and your hands lightly with flour. Pull out one-third of the dough and coat the outside lightly with flour (you don't want to incorporate more flour into the dough, you just want to be able to handle it). Gently work the dough into a smooth ball, stretching the surface and tucking the ends underneath, adding more flour as needed so it doesn't stick to your hands. (Don't overwork the dough; this process should only take about 30 seconds.) Put the dough ball onto the prepared baking sheet and let it rest at room temperature, uncovered, for about 40 minutes. (If the dough has been refrigerated, allow it to rise for 60 minutes, or up to 90 minutes if you want a more open and airy crumb structure.) The dough will rise a bit. It may also spread/flatten a bit; that's okay., Preheat the oven to 450°F. Set one rack in the lowest position of the oven and one rack in the middle position. Place a metal pan (any metal cake pan or broiler pan will work; just don't use glass) on the bottom rack. (You will fill this with water later to create steam in the oven)., Generously dust the dough with flour. Using a sharp knife, make a few ½-inch-deep slashes in the dough -- a scallop, cross, or tic tac toe pattern all look nice., Slide the baking sheet with the dough into the oven, and carefully fill the metal cake pan with one cup of hot tap water. (Try to do this quickly so as not to let heat out of the oven.) Bake until the loaf is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack., This bread is best enjoyed fresh on the day it is made. Once sliced, place the loaf cut-side down on a cutting board or plate and leave it uncovered. (If it lasts beyond a day, I suggest slicing and freezing.), Freezer-Friendly Instructions The dough can be portioned into thirds and frozen in airtight plastic containers for up to 1 month. Defrost the dough in the refrigerator overnight, then shape, rest and bake as usual. The baked loaves can also be frozen whole or sliced: Wrap in a zip-top freezer bag and freeze for up to 1 month. (If you plan to use slices one at a time, place pieces of parchment between them so they don't stick.) To thaw, take the bread out of the freezer and let it come to room temperature on the countertop. Reheat in a 350°F oven until warmed through, about 10 minutes., Note: Active dry yeast may be used instead of instant/rapid-rise yeast, however, the dough will take longer to rise. To give active dry yeast a boost, you can dissolve it in the lukewarm water and let it sit until frothy, about 10 minutes. After that, add it to the flour and salt, and proceed with the recipe., Note: I use King Arthur flour, which is higher in protein than some other all-purpose flours. If using a flour with a lower protein content, such as Gold Medal, you will likely need to add a few more tablespoons of flour.","[('flour', 6.5, 'cups'), ('salt', 4, 'teaspoons'), ('yeast', 1.5, 'tablespoons'), ('water', 3, 'cups')]"

Pour in the water and gently mix together with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon. The dough will seem dry and shaggy, but keep working it until all the flour is moistened. If needed, use your hands (as I do in the video tutorial below) to work the dough ingredients together. The dough will be sticky. Shape into a ball in the bowl as best you can., Keeping the dough in the bowl, cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and set on the counter at room temperature (honestly any normal room temperature is fine!). Allow to rise for 2-3 hours. The dough will just about double in size, stick to the sides of the bowl, and have a lot of air bubbles., You can continue with step 4 immediately, but for absolute best flavor and texture, I strongly recommend letting this risen dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours and up to 3 days. Place covered dough in the refrigerator for 12 hours – 3 days. I usually let it rest in the refrigerator for about 18 hours. The dough will puff up during this time, but may begin to deflate after 2 days. That’s fine and normal—nothing to worry about., Lightly dust a large nonstick baking sheet (with or without rims and make sure it’s nonstick) with flour and/or cornmeal. Turn the cold dough out onto a floured work surface. Using a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut dough in half. Some air bubbles will deflate as you work with it. Place dough halves on prepared baking sheet. Using floured hands, shape into 2 long loaves about 9×3 inches each (doesn’t have to be exact) about 3 inches apart. Loosely cover and allow to rest for 45 minutes. You will bake the dough on this prepared baking sheet., During this 45 minutes, preheat the oven to 475°F (246°C)., When ready to bake, using a very sharp knife or bread lame (some even use kitchen shears), score the bread loaves with 3 slashes, about 1/2 inch deep. (“Score” = shallow cut.) If the shaped loaves flattened out during the 45 minutes, use floured hands to narrow them out along the sides again., Optional for a slightly crispier crust: After the oven is preheated and bread is scored, place a shallow metal or cast iron baking pan or skillet (I usually use a metal 9×13-inch baking pan) on the bottom oven rack. Carefully and quickly pour 3-4 cups of boiling water into it. Place the scored dough/baking pan on a higher rack and quickly shut the oven, trapping the steam inside. The steam helps create a crispier crust., Place the shaped and scored dough (on the flour/cornmeal dusted pan) in the preheated oven on the center rack. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Gently tap the loaves—if they sound hollow, the bread is done. For a more accurate test of doneness, the bread is done when an instant read thermometer inserted in the center reads 195°F (90°C)., Remove the bread from the oven and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes before slicing and serving.

Cover the bowl with a wet towel or plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature out of direct sunlight for 12-18 hours or overnight and up to two days. The dough should bubble up and rise to double its original size., Generously dust a work surface with flour. Scrape the dough out of the bowl and into one mound on top of the floured surface. It should be loose and sticky. Using floured hands, lift the outside edges toward the center, working around the entire piece to make a smooth round ball., You can leave the dough as one large bread loaf, placing it on a floured baking sheet and covering it with a tea towel.

Add the water. Mix until the flour is absorbed. (If you are using active dry yeast, see notes below.), Let it rise, Cover bowl with a tea towel or plastic wrap and set aside in a warm spot to rise for at least an hour. (In the winter or if you are letting the bread rise in a cool place, it might take as long as two hours to rise.) This is how to create a slightly warm spot for your bread to rise in: Turn the oven on at any temperature (350ºF or so) for one minute, then turn it off. Note: Do not allow the oven to get up to 300ºF, for example, and then heat at that setting for 1 minute — this will be too hot. Just let the oven preheat for a total of 1 minute — it likely won’t get above 100ºF. The goal is to just create a slightly warm environment for the bread., Preheat the oven to 425ºF, . Grease two 1-qt or 1.5-qt oven-safe bowls (see notes below) with about a tablespoon of butter each. Using two forks, punch down your dough, scraping it from the sides of the bowl, which it will be clinging to. As you scrape it down try to pull the dough toward the center (see video below for guidance). You want to loosen the dough entirely from the sides of the bowl, and you want to make sure you’ve punched it down. Then, take your two forks and divide the dough into two equal portions — eye the center of the mass of dough, and starting from the center and working out, pull the dough apart with the two forks. Then scoop up each half and place into your prepared bowls. This part can be a little messy — the dough is very wet and will slip all over the place. Using small forks or forks with short tines makes this easier — my small salad forks work best; my dinner forks make it harder. It’s best to scoop it up fast and plop it in the bowl in one fell swoop. Some people like to use flexible, plastic dough scrapers for this step., Let the dough rise again, for about 20 to 30 minutes on the countertop near the oven (or near a warm spot) or until it has risen to just below or above (depending on what size bowl you are using) the top of the bowls. (Note: Do not do the warm-oven trick for the second rise, and do not cover your bowls for the second rise. Simply set your bowls on top of your oven, so that they are in a warm spot. Twenty minutes in this spot usually is enough for my loaves.), Bake it, Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375º and bake for 15 to 17 minutes longer.

(Alternatively, you can use your clean hands to mix and feel the stickiness.), Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let it sit in a warmer part of your house for 18-24 hours.In my tests, I found that the bread baked after 18 hours of rising time was perfect, but the 24-hour one was also good. One important thing to mention here is that at the end of the rising time you might see a thin (kind of hard - for the lack of a better word) layer at the top of the dough. Don’t be alarmed by that. In the next step, we will fold that into the dough and since it is a sticky one, the additional rising time will help soften it., Lightly flour a piece of parchment paper, gently remove the dough from the bowl, and place it onto the parchment. While removing, you will realize that it is quite sticky. However, if you take your time and gently pull it by folding it onto itself, you will see that it will come out easily without any dough remaining in the bowl. For a visual, be sure to watch the video below., Form the dough into a ball tucking the sides of the dough under. Lightly dust it with a little bit of flour, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size. Again, I recommend letting it sit in a warmer part of your house., Towards the end of the rising time, place your dutch oven in the oven and pre-heat it to 450 F degrees., When ready to bake, carefully take the now-very hot dutch oven out of the oven. Using the edges of the parchment paper place the dough into the dutch oven. Put the lid on and bake for 30 minutes.

Once you have added all of the 2 ½ cups, add in your next cup of flour ¼ cup at a time. I found that I only needed ½ cup more to reach the desired texture. The dough stayed in ball form, pulled away from the sides while mixing, and was slightly tacky when I knew it was enough flour and enough kneading., Remove bowl from stand mixer and sprinkle the dough with flour, moving the ball around to coat all sides, so there is no sticking., Cover the bowl with a tea towel and place in a warm area until the dough doubles in size, usually within an hour., After the dough doubles in size, turn onto a well-floured surface, and without punching the air out, gently pull and fold edges towards the center, making a neat round ball.

Cover and place the bowl in a warm, draft-free area and allow it to rise (proof) for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in volume., Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight, but up to 10 days., On baking day, remove the dough from refrigerator and dump it out onto well-floured surface. Knead until fairly smooth, adding more flour as necessary. If not using the psyllium husks, it will be a somewhat sticky dough so keep a small bowl of flour on hand to sprinkle the dough and/or surface with extra flour., To shape into a boule, simply form into a round ball, pulling the dough up and under the ball and pinching on the bottom. Place on parchment paper. To shape into a baguette, smooth the dough and roll into a rope shape, tapering it at the ends, adding more flour as necessary. Roll out as thick or thin as you'd like and as long as you're able to fit in your oven (make sure it will fit on your pizza steel or stone). Place it on a sheet of parchment paper., Place the loaf or loaves, covered loosely with plastic wrap, in a warm, draft-free area to rise until visibly puffed and slightly larger, but not doubled in size, about 1/2 to 1 hour. This time will vary depending on the warmth of your proofing area., BAKING STEEL OR STONE METHOD: Set up your oven for baking. Place a baking steel or stone (or overturned baking sheet) onto the middle rack with a shallow pan on a rack underneath. Preheat the oven to 450° F., DUTCH OVEN METHOD: Place a Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid into the oven and preheat it to 500° F. You won't need the shallow pan with steam as enough steam will be created in the Dutch oven once the bread goes in. NOTE: This will only work with boules or loaves that can fit into the Dutch oven. If you're making a longer batard or baguette, you'll need to use the first method., When the dough has finished rising and is visibly puffed, run a serrated knife under hot tap water and cut slits in the dough swiftly but uniformly, about ½-¾ inch deep., BAKING STEEL OR STONE METHOD: Fill a measuring cup with one cup of very hot water (from the tap is fine). Using a pizza peel (paddle), slide the loaf (or loaves) onto the baking steel (or stone), parchment and all. Immediately pour the cup of very hot tap water into the shallow pan. Quickly shut the oven door., DUTCH OVEN METHOD: Remove the lid carefully and carefully lower the dough, parchment and all, into the Dutch oven. Replace the lid and shut the oven door. Immediately reduce the temperature down to 450° F., BAKING STEEL OR STONE METHOD: Bake for about 30 minutes for baguettes, or about 40 minutes for boules, OR longer for larger boules (some larger boules can take up to an HOUR or more). If the loaves are getting too browned, you can cover them loosely with foil. The loaves will look crusty and done on the outside, but will feel light when picked up. If they feel heavy, they're not done yet. Allow them to bake for another 5-10 minutes and then check again, picking up the loaf with two gloved hands. If they're still feeling heavy, allow them to bake for another 5 minutes and check again., DUTCH OVEN METHOD: Bake the bread for 40 minutes with the lid on. Remove the cover and continue to bake for another 20 minutes. Check for doneness by picking up the loaf (with gloved hands). If the loaf feels relatively light for its size, it's done. If it feels at all heavy, it's not done and give it another 5-10 minutes before checking again., Remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack.

I prefer my hand so you can feel exactly how wet or dry your dough is., Bring your dough together to form a ball that cleans the bottom of the bowl. (If your dough is a little on the dry side add a splash more water)., Remove the dough from the bowl and grease that bowl with a little olive oil. Place your dough back into the bowl and tightly cover with cling wrap and a dishtowel., Bulk Fermentation:, Set aside the dough to proof for roughly 12-18 hours. I mix mine up the night before and let it proof overnight. If you are unable to bake it off after this time place it in the fridge for up to 3 days., Carefully remove the dough from the bowl and place on a floured surface. I don’t knock out the air but rather I fold the dough over itself to strengthen it., Shape and Proof your Sourdough:, On a flourless surface, shape the dough into a boule or a ball by pushing the dough against your surface to make it round and smooth., Lay a kitchen towel in a bowl or breadbasket and dust it generously with flour., Place your dough into the bowl with the seams facing you and the smooth side down. Cover over with the towel so that none of the dough is exposed to the air. (Air is not a doughs friend so keep it well covered so it doesn’t form a skin), Proofing the Sourdough:, Proof the dough for roughly 1 ¾ -2 ½ hours or until the bread has risen to almost double the size. Don't rush this step, if your bread is not ready then give it the time it needs. Once the dough is well risen and feels almost lighter and not as dense then it’s time to bake it off., Baking the Sourdough:, Preheat your oven to 450°F (225°C) and place a tray on a lower shelf in the oven., Safely and carefully turn the dough out onto a different floured flat baking tray. Gently, shape it back into a round loaf with your hands by pushing the seams underneath the bread., Score the bread with a blade or a sharp knife. I cut it straight down the middle., Turn down the oven to 400°F (200°C) and slide your bread onto your preheated tray., Bake for 55-65 minutes or until a gorgeous golden brown color., Creating Steam in the Oven:, So this is optional, BUT, the introduction of steam during the baking process does make a big difference to the texture and color of your crust. You can do this by using a Dutch oven, an oven-proof metal bowl, or a cake pan with water., Dutch Oven:, Skip the proofing bowl and allow the dough to proof in the actual dutch oven for the time given above. Making sure to line it with parchment or dust with flour beforehand., Once risen and not as dense, bake your sourdough with the lid on for roughly 25-30 minutes. Remove the lid and continue to bake in the pot for the remaining time., Large Metal Bowl:, Place a large metal oven-proof bowl directly over the dough immediately as it goes into the oven. This bowl will create steam around your loaf. Carefully remove the metal bowl after 30 minutes and bake as normal for the remaining time. Tip: An 18/10 stainless steel pot with stainless steel handles will work well for this., Cake Pan with Water:, Place a cake pan or shallow baking tray in the oven with hot water to create steam for the bread giving it a nice color and chewier crust. Carefully remove the cake pan of water after 30 minutes and bake as normal for the remaining time., Once the crust is crisp, a deep golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped remove from the oven. Note: the crust softens once it cools so just note that you might think it got too crisp but a little later it will be softer., Allow cooling down completely before cutting your bread. It’s tempting, but don’t cut hot bread, it’s just not the same. Let it cool down for at least 2-3 hours before cutting., Store your sourdough covered at room temperature for up to 3 days.

Tuck the edges of the dough into the center and work around the edges until you've tucked them all in. Flip the ball dough over. Let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes., Using your hands, gently pull the dough ball towards you, letting its grip on the counter pull it into a tighter ball. Rotate the dough slightly and repeat around the edges until you've formed a tight ball (if this is confusing, watch the video on the post where I demonstrate how to do this! It's not hard once you see it done once)., Prepare a bread proofing basket by dusting it well with flour (if it's new, you'll need to season it by spraying it with a little water and then adding the flour so it sticks), or you can use a medium mixing bowl (about 8 inches across). To prepare the mixing bowl, you'll want to coat it generously with cooking spray and then flour very well, or you can line it with a kitchen towel and dust it very well with flour., Place your dough ball, smooth top down, into your prepare basket or bowl, and cover with a damp towel., Let the dough rest for 1 to 2 hours, at room temperature, or until it's spread out a bit and looks puffy., Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F., Gently turn your bread dough out onto a piece of parchment paper (I like to put my parchment paper on top of a thin cutting board, put the paper and board on top of my bread basket, and turn it over gently)., Remove the dough from the bowl. Score the top with a lame, or sharp knife (serrated knife works, too)., Use the corners of the parchment paper to lift the dough into your dutch oven. Place the lid on the dutch oven., Place the dutch oven in the hot oven and cook for 30 minutes., Remove the lid and put the dutch oven back in the oven, uncovered, for another 20 to 30 minutes., The bread will be very dark and sound hollow when tapped when it is done., Remove the pan from the oven, and then remove the bread from the pan and let it cool on a wire rack for 1 hour before slicing and serving., Sourdough bread is best eaten the day of, though leftovers make great toast or grilled sandwiches.","[('starter', 50.0, 'grams'), ('water', 350.0, 'grams'), ('flour', 500.0, 'grams'), ('salt', 10.0, 'grams')]"
d4a17163,https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/no-knead-crusty-white-bread-recipe,No-Knead Crusty White Bread,"7 1/2 cups (900g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour, 3 cups (680g) water lukewarm, 1 tablespoon (18g) table salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons (14g) instant yeast or active dry yeast","The flour/liquid ratio is important in this recipe, so measure carefully. Your best bet is to weigh the flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess., , Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, or a large (6-quart), food-safe plastic bucket. For first-timers, ""lukewarm"" means about 105°F, but don't stress over getting the temperatures exact here. Comfortably warm is fine; ""OUCH, that's hot!"" is not. Yeast is a living thing; treat it nicely., Mix and stir everything together to make a very sticky, rough dough. If you have a stand mixer, beat at medium speed with the beater blade for 30 to 60 seconds. If you don't have a mixer, just stir-stir-stir with a big spoon or dough whisk until everything is combined., Next, you're going to let the dough rise. If you've made the dough in a plastic bucket, you're all set — just let it stay there, covering the bucket with a lid or plastic wrap; a shower cap actually works well here. If you've made the dough in a bowl that's not at least 6-quart capacity, transfer it to a large bowl; it's going to rise a lot. There's no need to grease the bowl, though you can if you like; it makes it a bit easier to get the dough out when it's time to bake bread., Cover the bowl or bucket, and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Then refrigerate it for at least 2 hours, or for up to about 7 days. (If you're pressed for time, skip the room-temperature rise, and stick it right into the fridge). The longer you keep it in the fridge, the tangier it'll get; if you chill it for 7 days, it will taste like sourdough. Over the course of the first day or so, it'll rise, then fall. That's OK; that's what it's supposed to do., When you're ready to make bread, sprinkle the top of the dough with flour; this will make it easier to grab a hunk. Grease your hands, and pull off about 1/4 to 1/3 of the dough — a 400g to 540g piece, if you have a scale. It'll be about the size of a softball, or a large grapefruit., Plop the sticky dough onto a floured work surface, and round it into a ball, or a longer log. Don't fuss around trying to make it perfect; just do the best you can., Place the loaf on a piece of parchment (if you're going to use a baking stone); or onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Sift a light coating of flour over the top; this will help keep the bread moist as it rests before baking. Drape the bread with greased plastic wrap, or cover it with a reusable cover., Let the loaf warm to room temperature and rise; this should take about 60 minutes (or longer, up to a couple of hours, if your house is cool). It won't appear to rise upwards that much; rather, it'll seem to settle and expand. Preheat your oven to 450°F while the loaf rests. If you're using a baking stone, position it on a middle rack while the oven preheats. Place a shallow metal or cast iron pan (not glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack, and have 1 cup of hot water ready to go., When you're ready to bake, take a sharp knife and slash the bread 2 or 3 times, making a cut about 1/2"" deep. The bread may deflate a bit; that's OK, it'll pick right up in the hot oven., Place the bread in the oven — onto the baking stone, if you're using one, or simply onto a middle rack, if it's on a pan — and carefully pour the 1 cup hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. It'll bubble and steam; close the oven door quickly., Bake the bread for 25 to 35 minutes, until it's a deep, golden brown., Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a rack., Store leftover bread in a plastic bag at room temperature.

If the mixture does not froth up and rise, discard the yeast and start over when you have a fresh batch of dried yeast., Combine all ingredients:Into a bowl of a mixer, sift 3 cups of flour. Then add 1/3 cup sugar, remaining 1/2 cup warm milk, 4 egg yolks, 2 tbsp sour cream, 1 tbsp vanilla extract, and the risen yeast mixture. By hand, using a spoon or the hook of the mixer, quickly mix the ingredients until a rough, shaggy mixture forms., Knead: Attach the hook back to the mixer and knead on low speed (speed 2 to 3 on a Kitchenaid mixer) for about 20 minutes or until the dough stops sticking to the side of the bowl, feels elastic, and is tacky to touch. If the dough is adequately kneaded, a small piece can be stretched into a see-through ""window"" without tearing.Pro tip: Do not over-knead past a point where the dough is elastic and stretchy. If the gluten is overworked, it will tear, leaving you with a chunky dough that doesn't have the strength to hold a good rise of the dough., Add 3 oz of butter and 1/4 tsp of the salt and knead it into the bread until no streaks of butter are seen (~5-7 minutes). Sometimes tearing the dough into chunks helps to incorporate the butter easier/faster., 1st Rise: Oil the sides of the bowl and the dough. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and leave in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 1.5 hours. Boil a cup of water in a microwave for several minutes. Remove the cup with water. Place the bowl with the dough in the warm microwave for the dough to rise. This gives the dough a nice warm place without being too hot., Shape: This recipe makes one large braid. To make two smaller sweet yeast bread loaves divide the dough into two, then shape two separate braids instead of one like the recipe instructs.Once risen, divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Weighing the dough is the best way to divide the dough evenly. Next, roll each piece into a tight ball, then into a 20-inch log. If the dough is hard to stretch or it springs back too much, cover it with a tea towel and leave for 10-15 minutes. This will relax the gluten and make it easy to roll.Pinch the ends of the 3 strands together at one end, then braid them into a braid pinching the ends together. Now, tuck both ends of the braid underneath itself slightly to give it a better shape., 2nd Rise: Transfer the sweet yeast braids to a 12""x18"" baking sheet pan. Space them evenly. Cover with a clean tea towel. Transfer to a warm place once again until the braid doubles in size or a light pressing of the finger doesn't make the dough spring back quickly, but instead slowly springs back while still leaving slight indent., Prep before baking: Once doubled in size preheat the oven to 350F with the baking rack centered. Brush the braid with a whisked egg yolk and water and sprinkle with sesame seeds or poppy seeds if you wish. Applying the egg yolk mixture several times will give you a darker glaze once baked., Bake the braid for about 30-35 minutes or until the top is golden brown. You can also check for doneness with a thermometer. The center of the thickest part should register 195°F. If the top starts to brown before the inside registers 195F, loosely tent the sweet yeast bread with foil.Once baked, remove from the oven to a cooling rack and cool completely before cutting or eating.","[('whole milk', 1.0, 'cup'), ('instant dry yeast', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('all-purpose flour', 3.0, 'cups'), ('granulated sugar', 0.33, 'cup'), ('egg yolks', 4.0, None), ('sour cream', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('unsalted butter', 3.0, 'oz'), ('kosher salt', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('egg yolk', 1.0, None), ('water', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('sesame seeds', 3.0, 'tbsp')]"

Roll each into a 15” rope., To Make the Braid:, Lay the 4 strands beside each other on a baking sheet/cookie sheet (I do not recommend lining with parchment paper). Rather than start from one end of the bread and work to the other, I always start from the center (this helps ensure an even braid). I find it helpful to mentally label these pieces 1, 2, 3, and 4 (with 1 being your piece to the far left and 4 on the far right)., Starting from the center, weave strand 4 over the piece beside it (3), beneath the next one (2) and then over the left-most strand (1)., Repeat this process, always starting with your furthest-right piece, keeping the strands snug., Once you reach the end, press/smash the ends together tightly and fold underneath the braid. Then turn the baking pan 180 degrees and work from the center to complete the other side, following the same steps as above., Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a clean towel and allow the bread to rise again for 30-40 minutes in a warm, draft-free place.

Using a whisk, give it a quick stir, and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes or until it foams up. If it does not activate or foam up, do not proceed with the remaining recipe. You need to start this step all over. See the recipe notes below for using instant yeast., The Dough, Once the yeast activates, add the oil, eggs, sugar, lemon zest, vanilla, warm milk, and melted butter. I melted the butter and milk together on the stove. Don’t add it in scorching hot; the butter and milk should be warm, not hot., Using a whisk, stir the ingredients until the egg yolks and whites are broken up. Add the dough hook attachment on the stand mixer and, with the mixer on medium-low speed, mix while gradually adding the flour, until all the flour is included, and the dough pulls away from the sides of the mixing bowl. The dough will take 6 to 8 minutes to come together and knead., Remove the dough from the stand mixer, shape it into ball, and lightly grease it with the melted butter or oil. Place the dough back in the bowl of the stand mixer and loosely cover with a lint-free kitchen towel or plastic wrap., Leave the dough in a warm spot for 2 hours, or until the dough has tripled in size. I like to leave mine in the oven with the door closed. Do not turn the oven on; just leave it in there to rise in a draft-free environment. While the dough is rising, line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper., Once risen, punch the dough down and place it on a clean counter. Cut the dough in half and cut each half into 3 equal pieces. You should have 6 equal pieces of dough. (I weighed my pieces and they were 283 g each, but weighing is not a required step.) Form each dough piece into a ball and then roll each ball into a 14 to 15-inch-long rope. Line up 3 of the the ropes in parallel lines and pinch the tops of the 3 pieces together to bind them. Then, braid the 3 ropes to form a loaf. Pinch the bottom of the 3 ropes together to seal the braided loaf., Make the second loaf with the remaining 3 pieces of dough, following the same pinching and braiding method. Once the two loaves are braided, transfer them onto the parchment paper-lined baking sheets, cover them with a lint-free kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let them rise in a warm spot for 1 hour. After 45 minutes, place a rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 350F., Before Baking, After the loaves have risen, uncover them and brush with egg wash. Sprinkle on sesame seeds (or your topping of choice) and bake on the middle rack of the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden. You may need to bake the loaves one at a time depending on if they fit on one baking sheet or if two baking sheets fit on one shelf of the oven., My loaves took 35 minutes to bake. Keep an eye on them as they bake, as the baking time will depend on the model of oven and how tightly the loaves are braided. If you are unsure if your loaves are done, you can insert an instant-read thermometer in the center of the loaf. The bread is ready when it is 190F in the interior., Transfer the loaves to a cooling rack and let cool completely. At this point, you can decorate the loaves with some mini eggs, if you like. Once the loaves are cool, serve or wrap well in plastic wrap to ensure they stay nice and fresh for the following day. This sweet bread is perfect even after a few days; all you have to do is toast it and add some butter on top.

Put your blueberries into a small bowl and cover them with 10g of Maple Syrup and just enough boiling water to cover them. Cover with cling wrap and put aside until you need them (these can be made the day before if you want, but as long as they sit for an hour they will be fine)., Add your lemon zest to the brown sugar. Use a spoon to mash them together a little and then let them sit while you prepare the dough. The sugar will emulsify with the lemon zest and become glossy., Premix & Autolyse:Weigh out your sourdough starter and water into a large ceramic or glass bowl. This recipe is based on you having an active starter that you have fed a few hours before starting your bake.Mix the water and starter together briefly. Then add your flour and salt and mix together with the end of a wooden spoon. The dough will be fairly shaggy and only just brought together., Cover your bowl with cling film or a damp tea towel and let it sit for around 1 hour. It's ok if it's a little longer., Forming Up Your Dough:After the dough has been through autolyse, you need to bring it together into a ball. You'll notice that the dough is fully hydrated after soaking up all the liquid. It will be fairly sticky but as you bring it into a ball, it will become smoother and shinier.6Work your way around the bowl, grabbing the dough from the outside and stretching it up and over itself until a smooth ball is formed. You shouldn't need more than 20-25 folds to form the ball, you might need less. You just need to let the dough tell you Once the dough has formed into a smooth ball, pop the cling film back on and let it rest for around 30 minutes., Stretch & Folds / Adding Flavors:Over the next few hours, you need to create some structure for you dough by stretching and folding. Aim to do around 4-6 sets of stretches and folds. For each set, stretch the dough up and over itself 4 times. You'll find it gets easier to do at each set as the gluten in your dough develops.8, Around your second or third set of stretch and folds, add the drained blueberries and sweet lemon zest. Try to incorporate them without disturbing all the beautiful bubbles that will be forming in your dough. I find it's easiest to actually get your dough out of the bowl and pop it on the bench top. Add the flavors on top of the dough and gently stretch and fold the dough around them. Don't worry if they aren't all through your dough on the first add - you'll have them worked through by the last set., Bulk Ferment:Once you've finished your stretch and folds, place the cling film or damp tea towel back over your dough and let it rest and ferment., Shaping Your Dough:Once your dough has finished its bulk ferment, you need to shape it. I've chosen to shape into a boule for this recipe, but you can use any shape you prefer., Once you're happy with the shape, place your dough into your banneton or bowl, ensuring that you've liberally floured whatever you are using., Cold Ferment:Now your dough is in it's shaping container, cover it loosely with a plastic bag or damp tea towel and place it into the fridge.Try to leave it for a minimum of 5 hours, up to a maximum of 36 hours. The longer you leave it, the better your bread will be., Preparing To Bake:Once you're ready to bake your sourdough, you'll need to preheat your oven to 230C/450F. Place your Dutch Oven into the oven when you turn it on so that it gets hot. Try to preheat for around 1 hour to ensure your oven is super hot - but you know your oven, so just adjust this time if you need to.Leave the dough in the fridge until the very last minute., Time To Bake!When your oven is at temperature, take your sourdough out of the fridge. Gently place it onto a piece of baking paper or parchment paper.Gently score your bread with a lame, clean razor blade or knife. A cross is sufficient, but you can get as artistic as you like.Carefully take your Dutch Oven out of the oven. Place the sourdough into the pot using the baking paper as a handle. Put the lid on and place into the hot oven. If you want you can spritz your dough with extra water before you put the lid on., BAKE TIME:Bake your sourdough for 30 minutes with the lid on at 230C/450F plus12-15 minutes with the lid off at around 200C/390F. Keep an eye on your bread at this stage - because it has blueberries and sugar in it, the sugar can make the top go very dark, very quickly.I tend to turn my oven back to 200C for the last 10-15 minutes with the lid off as I don't want to caramelise the crust too much on this one. I find a lighter crust works better with the delicate lemon flavor., Once the time has elapsed, remove your sourdough from your Dutch Oven. Turn off your oven and place the sourdough back into the oven, directly on your oven rack. Let it cool in here with the door ajar for 1-2 hours.","[('sourdough starter', 75.0, 'g'), ('water', 350.0, 'g'), ('bread flour', 500.0, 'g'), ('salt', 10.0, 'g'), ('dried blueberries', 25.0, 'g'), ('maple syrup', 10.0, 'g'), ('brown sugar', 20.0, 'g')]"

In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and half the salt. Add it to the dough in the pan and knead with your hands to incorporate the dry ingredients into the dough. Place the dough in a medium-sized bowl., Beat the egg yolk with the remaining salt and add it to the dough. Knead to incorporate. The dough will be quite sticky. Dust your countertop with flour, plop the dough on top of it, dust the dough with a little more flour and knead until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky. It’s okay to dust the dough and countertop with flour every now and then, but don’t add too much flour, as this will affect the texture of the bread. I lightly dusted with flour four times. After about 5 minutes of kneading (and the 4 dustings of flour) the dough shouldn’t be sticky anymore., Butter a 20-cm or 8-inch round cake pan with butter and divide the dough into 7 equal chunks. Roll each chunk into a ball and arrange them in the baking pan, one dough ball in the middle, the other six in a circle around it (but place the middle ball in last). The dough balls should be touching each other. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and leave to rise until doubled in size, about 1½ hour. Every half hour or so, check on the dough to make sure it doesn’t touch the plastic wrap. I usually take the plastic wrap off as soon as the dough has risen high enough to just touch it to allow the dough to rise over the top of the pan., While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 180°C/360°F (standard oven setting). Once the dough has doubled in size, place the pan on an oven rack and place the rack one ridge under the middle of the oven. Bake for 30 minutes. After 15-20 minutes, loosely place a piece of aluminum foil on top of the bread to prevent the top from browning too much., Once the bread is done, make the glaze. In a small saucepan, gently heat the honey until loose and runny, then brush the top of the warm bread with it. Allow the bread to cool on a wire rack before cutting into it.

cef17fdf,https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2017/12/how-to-make-sourdough-cinnamon-rolls-step-by-step-guide/,Soft Sourdough Cinnamon Rolls,"160 g (2/3 cup) milk, whole or 2%, 28 g (2 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted (see notes below for variation), 1 large egg, 100 g (1/2 cup) bubbly, active sourdough starter, 24 g (2 tbsp) granulated sugar, 300 g (2½ cups) King Arthur all-purpose flour, 5 g (1 tsp) fine sea salt, cooking spray or oil, for coating, 28 g (2 tbsp) unsalted butter (see notes below for variation), 100 g (1/2 cup) granulated sugar, 3 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1 level tbsp. flour, 2 tbsp unsalted butter, softened, ⅓ cup whipped cream cheese, room temperature, ¼- 1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted (add more if you like it sweet!), 1-2 tbsp milk, For a richer dough, increase the butter to 115 (8 tbsp) and use 360 g (3 cups) flour total. The texture is incredible., Make sure the melted butter and milk mixture has cooled slightly before making the dough. If it’s too hot, the dough will become incredibly sticky like cake batter (I’ve experienced this many times). If this happens to you, don’t worry- wait for the dough to cool down before adding more flour, if needed., Recent recipe update: to prevent the cinnamon sugar filling from leaking while the rolls bake, instead of using 28g (2 tbsp) of melted butter, combine 84 g (6 tbsp) softened butter with the rest of the cinnamon-sugar filling ingredients listed above.","Baker's Schedule, Overnight Option, Make the dough in the evening and let rise overnight. The following morning, roll, cut and shape the dough. Rest for 1-2 hours (second rise) before baking., As an alternative, after resting for 1 hour, cover the dough and chill until ready to use. Rest at room temperature before baking. The dough should be plump and puffy before baking., Make-Ahead Option (Freeze): Place the cut & shaped cinnamon rolls into a parchment lined 9-inch springform pan. Cover with two layers of plastic wrap. Freeze until ready to use. The night before baking, remove the old plastic wrap and replace with fresh wrap (this prevents any condensation from dripping onto the rolls). Defrost overnight, about 10-12 hrs. at room temperature, approximately 67 F. Bake the following morning as directed., Make the Dough, In the evening: Combine the melted butter and milk in a small bowl. Cool slightly before using., Add the egg, sourdough starter, and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix to combine. With the machine running, slowly pour in the milk mixture. Add the flour and salt. Continue mixing until a rough, sticky dough forms, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes., After the dough has rested, switch to the dough hook. Knead on medium-low speed for 6-8 minutes (I use #2 or #3 on my stand mixer). The dough should feel soft, supple and pull away from the sides of the bowl when ready. If it’s too sticky add a small bit of flour., Bulk Rise, Transfer the dough to a medium-size bowl coated in butter. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise overnight until double in size, about 8-12 + hrs. @ 67-68 F, depending on temperature., Stretch and Fold the Dough (optional step): about 30 minutes- 1 hr. into the bulk rise stretch and fold the dough: grab a portion of the dough and stretch it upward. Fold it over toward the center of the bowl. Give the bowl a 1/4 turn; stretch and fold the dough again. Continue this technique until you’ve come full circle around the bowl (4 folds total). For video guidance, click here. This optional step will increase the overall volume of the rolls and aerate the dough., Roll the Dough, In the morning: Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper. I like to scrunch the paper into a ball first, open it up, and then line the inside with enough excess to hang over the sides for easy removal. It tends to fit better this way., Lightly oil and flour your countertop to prevent sticking. Coax the dough out of the bowl. Gently pat into a rough rectangle. Let rest for 10 minutes for easier rolling., Dust the dough (and your rolling pin) with flour. Roll the dough into a 16 x 12-ish rectangle using a tape measure for accuracy. If the dough resists, let rest for 5-10 minutes and try again., Make the Cinnamon-Sugar Filling, If using the softened butter variation (listed in the notes above): add 84 g (6 tbsp) softened butter to a small bowl. Mix with the sugar, cinnamon and flour. With an offset spatula, spread onto the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges., If using the melted butter version: brush the entire surface of the dough, including the top, bottom and sides with 28 g (2 tbsp) melted butter. Use all of it. Combine the sugar, cinnamon and flour in a bowl. Sprinkle the mixture onto the dough leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Smooth it out with your hands until it looks wet and sandy., Shape & Cut the Dough, Starting on the long side of the dough (16-inch), roll it into a log pressing down gently as you go. Take your time with this step. The log needs to be tight so the swirls stay in tact. You should end up seam side down. TIP: if the dough starts to get sticky from the heat of your hands, lightly oil or flour your fingertips, take a deep breath and try again., Cut the dough into 2-inch sections using a oiled knife or bench scraper. I lightly “mark” the dough first to make sure each piece is roughly the same size., Second Rise, Place the rolls into the lined pan and let rest for 1- 2 hours, or until the dough puffs up. Alternatively, if you’d like to chill or freeze the rolls, please refer to the “Make-Ahead” option in the Baker’s Schedule at the top of this recipe., Bake the Cinnamon Rolls, Preheat oven to 350 F. Bake the dough onto the center rack and bake for 35-40 minutes (check at the 30 minute mark). The tops should turn light golden brown when ready., Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 15 minutes. This helps the butter to absorb back into the dough. Then lift up the rolls, while still on the parchment paper, and transfer to a wire rack., Make the Glaze, While the rolls are baking or cooling make the glaze. Add softened butter, whipped cream cheese and sifted powdered sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat until smooth, thinning out the consistency with a little milk as needed. The ingredients must be soft and at room temperature for best results., To serve, top the rolls with some of the glaze or lightly dust with powdered sugar. These rolls are best enjoyed slightly warm on the same day they are baked.","[('milk', 160.0, 'g'), ('butter', 28.0, 'g'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('sourdough starter', 100.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 24.0, 'g'), ('flour', 300.0, 'g'), ('sea salt', 5.0, 'g'), ('butter', 28.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 100.0, 'g'), ('cinnamon', 3.0, 'tsp'), ('flour', 1.0, 'level tbsp'), ('butter', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('cream cheese', 1.0, 'cup'), ('powdered sugar', 0.5, 'cup'), ('milk', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('butter', 115.0, 'g'), ('flour', 360.0, 'g'), ('butter', 84.0, 'g')]"
