Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or foil., Pulse the bread crumbs in the bowl of a food processor until they are coarse or fine crumbs, depending on preference. Work in batches to ensure all pieces are processed evenly. You should end up with about 4 cups of crumbs. Set aside., In a large bowl, stir together olive oil, herbs, garlic powder, lemon zest if using, and salt. Add bread and stir to coat crumbs thoroughly and evenly. Tip: rubbing the pieces between your hands helps infuse the herb and lemon zest flavor more fully., Spread crumbs on baking sheet to form a single layer. Bake until the crumbs are completely dried out and reach your desired color, anywhere between 15-30 minutes, stirring every so often. The difference in baking time depends on how stale your bread was to begin with; more moisture = longer cooking time. Keep an eye on the crumbs towards the end of 15 minutes and monitor occasionally until done. Taste and add any additional salt desired at this time., Cool crumbs completely on baking sheet. Use immediately or store in an airtight container for up to 2 months in the freezer. If needed, re-crisp in a 375°F oven prior to serving.","('sourdough bread cubes', 5.0, 'cups'), ('extra virgin olive oil', 0.25, 'cup'), ('herbs', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('garlic powder', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('lemon zest', 1.0, None), ('kosher salt', 1.5, 'teaspoons')"
d66ca68c,https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/garlic-rosemary-herb-focaccia/,Garlic Rosemary Herb Focaccia,"2 cups (480ml) warm water (between 100–110°F, 38–43°C), 2 teaspoons granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons instant or active dry yeast (slightly less than 1 standard packet), 1/4 cup (60ml) extra virgin olive oil, 1 Tablespoon kosher salt, 4 and 1/2–5 cups (563–625g) all-purpose flour or bread flour (spooned & leveled), plus more for hands, 5 Tablespoons (75ml) extra virgin olive oil or more as needed, divided, 2 garlic cloves, minced, 3–4 Tablespoons chopped fresh herbs such as basil, thyme, and rosemary (or 2 Tablespoons dried herbs), sprinkle of coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper","Prepare the dough, Whisk half of the water (1 cup; 240ml), 2 teaspoons sugar, and 2 teaspoons yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes., Add the remaining water, olive oil, salt, and 1 cup (130g) flour. Beat on low speed for 20 seconds, then add 3 and 1/2 cups (440g) more flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. If the dough is still sticking to the sides of the bowl, add the last 1/2 cup (60g) of flour., Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., Let the dough rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with a teaspoon of oil or some nonstick spray—just use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 2–3 hours or until double in size. (Tip: For the warm environment on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150°F (66°C). Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When it’s doubled in size, remove from the oven.), Prepare the pan, Generously grease a 12×17-inch baking pan (with at least 1-inch-tall sides) with 2 Tablespoons of olive oil. This is the base layer of the bread, so be generous with the oil. A pastry brush is helpful to spread it., Flatten the dough, When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Place on the oiled baking pan, then stretch and flatten the dough to fit the pan. Don’t tear the dough. If it’s shrinking (mine always does), cover it with a clean towel and let it rest for 5–10 minutes before continuing. This lets the gluten settle and it’s much easier to shape after that., Let the dough rest, Cover the dough tightly and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. The longer it rests, the better the flavor. I recommend at least 12 hours., Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature as you preheat the oven and prepare the toppings. Keep it covered. It may rise a little during this time, but not much., Preheat oven to 450°F (232°C). Allow it to heat for at least 10–15 minutes so every inch of the oven is very hot., Prepare the toppings:, Whisk the 3 remaining Tablespoons of olive oil with the minced garlic and herbs. Set aside., Using your fingers, dimple the dough all over the surface. You can watch me do this in the video above. Drizzle on the olive oil topping and use your hands or a pastry brush to spread it all over the top. Add a little more olive oil if needed so the dough is completely covered. (This creates the crisp crust!) Sprinkle with a little coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper., Bake for 20–23 minutes or until lightly browned on top. If desired, broil on high for the last minute to really brown the top., Cut and serve hot or let it come to room temperature before slicing and serving. Focaccia tastes wonderful warm or at room temperature. Cover leftover focaccia tightly and store at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for 1 week. You can also freeze the baked and cooled focaccia for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. To reheat the slices, you can use the microwave or bake in a 300°F (149°C) oven for 5 minutes.","[('water', 2.0, 'cups'), ('sugar', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('yeast', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('olive oil', 1/4, 'cup'), ('salt', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('flour', 4.5, 'cups'), ('olive oil', 5.0, 'tablespoons'), ('garlic', 2.0, 'cloves'), ('herbs', 3.0, 'tablespoons'), ('salt', None), ('pepper', None)]"

Blend until almost all the butter has softened and combined with the herbs and garlic., Taking the back of a spoon or a spatula, spread the herbed garlic butter evenly across both sides of bread., Place in the oven to bake for 15-20 or until the butter melts and the sides of the bread gets golden and crisp.

c9f8b1d3,https://breadbakes.com/italian-herb-bread/,Italian Herb Bread,"525 grams White Bread Flour 14% protein, 2 T Mixed Italian Herbs, 425 grams Warm Water 90-100 F degrees, 11 grams Sea Salt, ⅛ tsp Instant Yeast","Scaling, Measure all ingredients using a digital metric scale.Hint: I prefer to make this dough at night, so about 5:00 p.m., I mix this dough and give it folds throughout the evening and then before bedtime, I place it in the refrigerator to bulk ferment overnight. OR, you can mix early morning, about 7:30 a.m., and leave to bulk ferment on the counter for 6-8 hours until doubled in size, plan to shape/bake that evening about 4:00 p.m., Mixing, Add white flour to large container or bowl., Add and mix Italian Herbs with the flour., Add warm water (90-100 F degrees)., Mix together until no dry flour remains and you have a rough dough., Cover dough and set aside for 30 minutes to allow the flour to autolyze (absorb the moisture)., After 30 minutes, uncover the dough and sprinkle the top evenly with the sea salt and the yeast., Pull outside edge of dough and fold over center, do this 4-6 times until yeast and salt are enclosed., Using two fingers (like you are making the ""OK"" symbol) cut through the dough 3 times., Pull outside edge of dough up, it will not stretch much at this point, and fold over center again, 4-6 times., Repeat the last two steps two more times until the salt and yeast are evenly distributed., Turn the dough over so the last folds you made are tucked under a loose ball. This dough will need to be folded 3-4 times over the next 1.5-2 hours., Cover the dough and allow to rest for 10 minutes., Uncover the dough and perform another fold by pulling the outside edge of the dough upwards, being careful not to tear the dough and folding over the center, 4-6 times., Hint: Every time you fold this dough it will gain elasticity, strength and rise. Pull the dough up and over to achieve maximum stretch without tearing it, this builds the structure to hold the developing carbon dioxide gas., Turn the dough over so the last folds you made are tucked under a loose ball., Wait 30 minutes and perform the last two steps again. You will do this two more times for a total of four folds., Hint: These folds can be done every 30 minutes or longer., Bulk Fermentation (first rise), After 3-4 folds, allow dough to rest until doubled in size, overnight in the refrigerator, or 6 hours at room temperature. My preferred method is to place this dough in the refrigerator overnight to slow the rise which develops flavor.Hint: Using a clear container allows you to easily see when the dough has risen to double its original size. Mark the outside of the container with a marker or elastic at the desired point., Punching/Folding, In the morning, pull the dough from the refrigerator, it should have doubled overnight. If not, leave it at room temperature until doubled. When dough has doubled in size it will be lofty with good structure, bubbles on top and inside. Flour a work surface and gently dump dough out. This will achieve ""punching"" the dough down, or expelling some of the carbon dioxide gas that developed during Bulk Fermentation stage., Dividing, This recipe makes 4 mini rounds. Divide the dough in half and then in half again. Flour a line down the short center of the dough and gently pushing a bench scraper or knife through to divide the dough in two. Divide these two halves again for a total of 4 pieces, about 220-240 gram each. Continue with next step., Next, pull outside edges of each piece of dough up (no need to stretch here) and fold over center, 4-6 times., Pre-shaping or Rounding, Flip dough over so folds are tucked under a loose ball. Repeat until you have 4 loose balls., Bench Proofing or Resting, Cover the loose balls with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and allow to rest for 5-10 minutes., Prepare the flat baking pan with parchment sprayed lightly with oil., Makeup and Panning, Uncover the dough balls. Tighten them into a round ball. To do that, cup hand around the rear of the round shape and drag the dough towards you on the work surface. Turn the dough a quarter of a turn. Gently pick the dough up and place it further away from you again. Repeat four times or as many times as it takes to create a tightly rounded dough ball. Hint: You will need a little friction to drag the dough ball to tighten it into a round. If there is no friction, clear the work surface of the majority of flour and try again., Once you have four tight dough balls, flour the tops. Pick each one up by gently sliding cupped hands under either side of the ball., Gently lay the balls onto the parchment paper allowing space for them to double. Cover with plastic wrap or a linen towel., Proofing (second rise), If you want to bake that morning, set the dough balls aside in a warm place to proof. Allow the dough balls to rise until it has relaxed and doubled in size. This may take 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the room temperature. Hint: If you prefer to bake later in the day, return the formed dough balls on the tray back to the refrigerator for a cold proof. This will take 8 hours. They can be removed from the refrigerator and baked right away once they have doubled in size., Baking, Approximately 30 minutes prior to baking, put a metal cake pan filled with very cold water into your oven to create steam. Set oven temp to 460 F degrees. Set timer for 30 minutes., When timer buzzes, check that your dough balls are doubled.Hint: To check if your dough has risen enough, you can perform the poke test. Poke the dough with a floured finger. If the indent springs back quickly, it is not yet ready to be baked. Allow it to continue to rise. If the indent springs back slowly, it is ready to be baked. If the indent does not spring back at all, it is over-proofed., If your dough is doubled, using kitchen sheers, cut an ""X"" pattern onto the top of each dough ball, being careful not to deflate the dough. Place pan with dough balls in oven to bake.Hint: If the water has boiled away, fill the cake pan again., Bake at 460 F degrees for 25-30 minutes, turn pan half way through baking., Hint: The darker the outside caramelization is on the crust, the more flavor your bread will have. I personally like to bake it to a very rich golden brown., Cooling, Remove the sheet pan with loaves and set on a heat proof surface., Immediately set bread on a cooling rack to allow air flow around the bread. Allow to cool at least 15 minutes, preferably 30 minutes, before slicing.Hint: I know it's hard to wait for that yummy first piece! However, the crumb needs time to cool so it does not get crushed when you try to cut the bread., Storing, If you do not use this bread immediately, it can be stored in the open air for 8 hours, or even overnight, as long as it is not cut., Once the bread has been cut, allow it to cool completely. Store cut side down on a cutting board for up to one day., After that time, slice the remaining bread, place slices in an airtight bag, and freeze the slices. Warm each slice in a toaster before eating.","[('white bread flour', 525.0, 'grams'), ('mixed italian herbs', 2.0, 't'), ('warm water', 425.0, 'grams'), ('sea salt', 11.0, 'grams'), ('instant yeast', 0.125, 'tsp')]"

It should look creamy or foamy after this time. If it doesn't, your yeast may be dead or the water may have been too hot. In this case, you will need to start again with fresh yeast and water that is not too hot or cold., DOUGH PREP: Once you have confirmed that the yeast is active, add 3 cups (445 grams) flour on top of the yeast mixture in the bowl. Then add 1-3/4 tsp salt on top of the flour.Use a strong silicone spatula to stir the mixture until a shaggy dough forms with no dry streaks of flour. The dough should be sticky and wet. If it is too dry, add a touch more water. If it is too wet, add a touch more flour. Drizzle 1 tsp. olive oil evenly over the dough. Then cover the bowl fully with plastic wrap., REST DOUGH: Leave the dough covered at room temperature (around 70°F or 21°C) for a minimum of 10 hours and a maximum of 18 hours.Leave the dough on the counter, free of draft. After the dough has risen for the desired amount of time, it should have more than doubled in size and be covered in small bubbles. It is now ready to be shaped and baked., PREP TO BAKE: Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Place the oven rack in the center of the oven. Place a 5.5-quart cast iron pot in the oven and heat it for 30 minutes before baking the bread., SHAPE: Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of flour on a clean work surface. Scrape all of the dough out of the bowl onto the flour using a spatula. Sprinkle 1 more tablespoon of flour on top of the dough.Use the spatula or a dough scraper to gently fold the sides of the dough inwards, making a total of 6 folds, to form a rough ball shape. Do not knead the dough; the ball does not need to be perfect.Set out a large piece of parchment paper (See Note 4) next to the dough ball. Use the spatula or dough scraper to gently transfer the ball to the parchment paper, flipping it upside down so that the seam sides are down and touching the paper. Slide the ball to the middle of the paper and press in the sides to gently shape it into a rough ball. (Optional: If you have a lamé, score the top of the dough ball 3-5 times using the tool.), BAKE: Working quickly, carefully pull the preheated pot from the oven, remove the lid, and lift the parchment paper with the dough ball up and into the pot. Drizzle the top of the bread with remaining 1 tbsp. olive oil and a light sprinkle of sea salt flakes if using. Cover the pot with the lid and bake for 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, keep the pot in the oven, but remove the lid and continue to bake for an additional 12-20 minutes, or until the bread sounds hollow when tapped in the middle and is a deep golden brown on top., COOL: After the bread has finished baking, carefully remove it from the pot, holding the sides of the parchment paper. Slide the bread off the paper and onto a wire cooling rack. Let the bread cool for 30 minutes. During this time, the steam from the bread will continue to cook it (See Note 5).Once the bread has cooled for 30 minutes, transfer it to a cutting board. Use a very sharp serrated knife to cut the bread. It is difficult to cut through the bottom crust without a sharp knife., STORAGE: On the first day, leave the bread out, uncovered, with the cut side down on a cutting board. This helps to keep the crust crisp without drying out the inside of the bread. After the first day, store the bread in an airtight container or bag. The bread may lose some of its crispy texture when stored this way, but it will still be delicious when toasted. To enjoy the bread after it has been stored, simply toast it as desired. The bread will taste great even if it has lost some of its original crispiness.","[('garlic', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('rosemary', 1.5, 'tablespoons'), ('thyme', 1.5, 'tablespoons'), ('black pepper', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('instant yeast', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('honey', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('warm water', 1.5, 'cups'), ('flour', 3.0, 'cups'), ('sea salt', 1.75, 'teaspoons'), ('olive oil', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('optional', None, None)]"

Cover and leave to sit for around an hour., Tip the dough out onto a clean surface and knead it until the dough is soft and supple. You can do this step in a stand mixer or Thermomix if you prefer. It will take around 10 minutes to knead by hand and around 5 minutes in a stand mixer., Place the kneaded dough back into a bowl and cover. Allow it to rise around 50%., While the dough is rising, make the filling for the dough so that it is ready to go when you need it. Simple chop all the herbs and garlic really finely (so that it's like minced herbs) and then add the herbs and parmesan cheese to the butter. Mix until well combined. You can do this in a food processor if you prefer. Set aside., Once the dough has risen a bit, tip it out onto a clean surface and gently shape it into a rectangle with the long edge in front of you. You're looking for a rectangle of around 25"" x 8"" (64 x 20 cm). Don't be afraid of degassing the dough as it will puff up in the next stage., Now spread the herb and garlic filling all over the dough, leaving a 1"" strip at the top with no filling., Roll the dough up into a big log - just like you would if you were making cinnamon rolls. Make sure it's rolled fairly tightly. Seal the dough up along the seam and roll it over so that the seam is at the bottom., Using a knife or dough scraper, cut the log through the middle all the way up, leaving just a small part of the dough attached so you have two strands. You will be able to see the swirls of garlic and herb butter where you have sliced it (refer to step by step photos in the blog above for visual aids on how to do this)., Now, twist the two strands of dough together to form a ""rope"". Gently push the ends together so that both ends of the rope are sealed. My rope was around 30"" (76 cm) long when I finished (the dough does stretch a bit)., Now form the rope into a letter ""S"" curling each end in towards the middle. This forms your twist. You can see how I've done this in the photos further up the page., Place your sourdough herb and garlic twist onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper, cover with a damp dishtowel and allow to proof for a few hours. You want your dough to be nice a puffy before you bake it., Once the dough has proofed, preheat the oven to 200C (392F) and bake for around 40 minutes or until golden. I recommend placing your twist on the lower shelf to avoid it burning. If your oven is fan forced or it runs hot, reduce this to temp to 180C (356F)., When the twist is cooked, remove it from the oven. Be careful if your baking tray has no sides as some of the butter may drip over the sides., Brush the finished bake with excess butter and serve warm.","[('sourdough starter', 100.0, 'g'), ('bread flour', 500.0, 'g'), ('salt', 8.0, 'g'), ('butter', 50.0, 'g'), ('milk', 200.0, 'g'), ('water', 50.0, 'g'), ('garlic', 3.0, 'cloves'), ('parmesan cheese', 50.0, 'g'), ('salted butter', 100.0, 'g'), ('fresh herbs', 1.0, 'bunch')]"

Add 50 grams water and stir with a spatula until combined. Cover the bowl with a tea towel or cloth bowl cover and set aside for 3 to 4 hours or until the dough’s surface is dimpled with holes., Make the dough, To the bowl of the poolish, add the water. The sponge should release from the bowl and parts of it, if not all of it, will float. Add the salt and stir briefly. Add the flour, and stir until you have a wet, sticky dough ball — dough will be very sticky. Cover with a tea towel or cloth bowl cover and let sit for 30 minutes., Stretches and folds, : With wet hands, grab one side of the dough, and pull up and to the center. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn, and repeat the grabbing and pulling. Do this until you’ve made a full circle. (Watch the video for more guidance. I employ a “slap-and-fold” technique, which is helpful when handling these wet doughs.) Cover the bowl. If time permits, repeat this process three more times at 30-minute intervals for a total of 4 sets of stretches and folds over the course of two hours. If you are short on time, know that doing just one or two sets of stretches and folds is totally fine., Let it rise, Transfer the dough to a straight-sided vessel, if you have one, or leave it in the bowl if you don’t. Cover the vessel with a towel and let rise until doubled in volume. Punch down (deflate) the dough — if your dough is still in the bowl, you can deflate it using wet hands right in the bowl; if your dough is in a straight-sided vessel, it may be easier to turn the dough out onto a work surface and ball it up using wet hands to prevent sticking. Return the dough to the vessel, cover it with an airtight lid, and transfer it to the refrigerator immediately for at least 12 hours. The dough can remain in the fridge for as long as 48 hours., Portion and shape, (Note: This is where I deviate from traditional ciabatta bread recipes. See notes in the post above for the more traditional shaping method.) Turn the dough out onto a work surface. I prefer to do this step without flour, but absolutely sprinkle your surface lightly with flour as needed to make the dough manageable to work with. Using a bench scraper or your hands, shape the dough into a tight ball; then use the bench scraper to divide the dough in half. If you want perfectly even balls, each portion will way roughly 455 grams. Again, use the bench scraper or your hands to ball up each portion into a tight ball — see video for guidance., Proof, Sprinkle your countertop liberally with flour. Place the balls top-side (smooth side) down onto the flour. The seam-side will be on top now, and it may split open — this is fine. Sprinkle the top surface of the balls liberally with flour. Cover with a tea towel and let rest for 2.5 hours. After 2 hours of proofing, heat the oven to 425ºF., Line a sheet pan with parchment paper, When the dough has finished proofing, gently flip each ball over — I find a bench scraper to be helpful here.

Pour in the water and gently mix together with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon. The dough will seem dry and shaggy, but keep working it until all the flour is moistened. If needed, use your hands (as I do in the video tutorial below) to work the dough ingredients together. The dough will be sticky. Shape into a ball in the bowl as best you can., Keeping the dough in the bowl, cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and set on the counter at room temperature (honestly any normal room temperature is fine!). Allow to rise for 2-3 hours. The dough will just about double in size, stick to the sides of the bowl, and have a lot of air bubbles., You can continue with step 4 immediately, but for absolute best flavor and texture, I strongly recommend letting this risen dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours and up to 3 days. Place covered dough in the refrigerator for 12 hours – 3 days. I usually let it rest in the refrigerator for about 18 hours. The dough will puff up during this time, but may begin to deflate after 2 days. That’s fine and normal—nothing to worry about., Lightly dust a large nonstick baking sheet (with or without rims and make sure it’s nonstick) with flour and/or cornmeal. Turn the cold dough out onto a floured work surface. Using a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut dough in half. Some air bubbles will deflate as you work with it. Place dough halves on prepared baking sheet. Using floured hands, shape into 2 long loaves about 9×3 inches each (doesn’t have to be exact) about 3 inches apart. Loosely cover and allow to rest for 45 minutes. You will bake the dough on this prepared baking sheet., During this 45 minutes, preheat the oven to 475°F (246°C)., When ready to bake, using a very sharp knife or bread lame (some even use kitchen shears), score the bread loaves with 3 slashes, about 1/2 inch deep. (“Score” = shallow cut.) If the shaped loaves flattened out during the 45 minutes, use floured hands to narrow them out along the sides again., Optional for a slightly crispier crust: After the oven is preheated and bread is scored, place a shallow metal or cast iron baking pan or skillet (I usually use a metal 9×13-inch baking pan) on the bottom oven rack. Carefully and quickly pour 3-4 cups of boiling water into it. Place the scored dough/baking pan on a higher rack and quickly shut the oven, trapping the steam inside. The steam helps create a crispier crust., Place the shaped and scored dough (on the flour/cornmeal dusted pan) in the preheated oven on the center rack. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Gently tap the loaves—if they sound hollow, the bread is done. For a more accurate test of doneness, the bread is done when an instant read thermometer inserted in the center reads 195°F (90°C)., Remove the bread from the oven and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes before slicing and serving.

You have two options for baking the pita from here., To bake pita in the oven:, Heat the oven to 475 degrees F and place a heavy-duty baking pan or large cast iron skillet on the middle rack to heat. Working in batches, place the rolled-out pitas directly on the hot baking baking sheet (I was only able to fit 2 at a time). Bake for 2 minutes on one side, and then, using a pair of tongs, carefully turn pita over to bake for 1 minute on the other side. The pita will puff nicely and should be ready. Remove from the oven and cover the baked pitas with a clean towel while you work on the rest of the pitas., To cook pita on stovetop: Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. (Test by adding a couple drops of water to the skillet, the skillet is ready when the beads of water sizzle immediately). Drizzle a tiny bit of extra virgin olive oil and wipe off any excess. Working with one pita at a time, lay a rolled-out pita on the skillet and bake for 30 seconds, until bubbles start to form. Using a spatula, flip the pita over and cook for 1-2 minutes on the other side, until large toasted spots appear on the underside. Flip again and cook another 1-2 minutes to toast the other side. The pita is ready when it puffs up forming a pocket (sometimes, with this method, the pita may not puff or may only form a small pocket.

For a round loaf, remove the crust by cutting the loaf in half top to bottom (then pause to smell the fresh, yeasty bread). Stand each half on its cut side. Cut off the bottom, flat crust first, then work in smaller sections with the knife, “peeling” the remaining crust off the bread. To remove crust from sliced bread, stack the slices and cut top to bottom to remove crusts from all the slices in one motion., Cut or tear bread into approximately equal chunks, about 1 to 2 inches each. To ensure equal sized chunks that can be made quickly, use the serrated knife to thickly slice the bread, then stack slices and make crosswise cuts to get squares., Fill food processor about half full of bread chunks (work in batches if all the chunks won’t fit). Pulse the bread chunks in 5 to 10 second bursts until you reach the desired crumb size. You shouldn’t have to open the food processor to scrape down the sides or stir. When a recipe doesn’t specify crumb size, aim for just smaller than a peppercorn, with a few larger or smaller pieces. Err on the larger size to avoid ending up with bread powder., If not using right away, store crumbs in resealable freezer bags, labeled with the quantity of crumbs inside. Squeeze out most of the excess air as you seal, without crushing the crumbs at all. Even if you store all the crumbs in a large bag, they’re easy to break up when frozen so you can thaw only the quantity you need. Thaw in a sealed container at room temperature or in the refrigerator, so the crumbs don’t dry out.","[('bread', 1.0, 'loaf')]"

Start to mix the yeast in until combined., Start the kneading process. This could take 25 minutes with fresh milled flour, or less. This varies greatly, so the best way to check if the dough is done being kneaded, is to check for a window pane test., Once a successful window pane test is done, then, cover the dough and let it rise until doubled.

(Even if you already fed it in the morning. You want it nice and strong the night before.), Then, mill the flour. I like to use mostly hard white wheat with a little Kamut (Khorasan Wheat). Just make sure to use mostly hard wheat of some sort for this recipe. Otherwise, it will not develop the gluten enough to have a nicely risen loaf of bread., In a stand mixer, add water, melted butter (or oil), sugar (or honey), salt, and egg. Mix all these ingredients to combine., Then, add the freshly milled flour to the stand mixer, and start to mix slowly until all the dry flour is completely incorporated., Add the sourdough starter into the dough, and mix until incorporated. (The dough will seem very wet at this stage.), Cover, and let the dough sit at room temperature for a minimum of 15 minutes, or up to 1 hour. This resting time is important, It allows the fresh milled to start absorbing the liquid, and the bran to start softening. This is the Autolyse step., After the dough has had time to Autolyse, then start the kneading process. This kneading process could take anywhere between 7 to 30 minutes. This time varies greatly, so the best way to tell if the dough is done being kneaded is to check the dough itself. You want a nice stretchy dough that wants to stay together. This is a wet dough, so try to resist adding flour to it. See video for the desired texture of dough that you are looking for., Once kneaded, cover the dough and let it rise until doubled. This can take anywhere from 2 to 8 hours depending on your sourdough starter, and how warm it is in your kitchen. (Other variables I mentioned above in my blog post can affect this rise time as well.) Mine generally takes about 3- 4 hours for example., Prepare bread loaf pans with parchment paper., After the dough has doubled in size, then on a lightly oiled surface, cut the dough in half. This will make 2 small 1 pound loafs. See notes for other size bread pans. I use small 4x8 bread pans., Press each piece flat, then roll to shape, I show one shaping technique option in my video. But, make sure there is some surface tension, and no air pockets while rolling. it will be sticky so I recommend oiling your hands as well as the work surface., Place each loaf in the lined bread tin, and cover. Let rise this second time for 2-3 hours, or until it has risen and looks puffy. (Times may vary greatly, so make sure to check your dough occasionally during this second rise time.), During the end of this second rise preheat oven to 400*F., Once the loafs have risen and look puffy, you can brush with an egg wash to make the loaf shiny and more browned. This step is optional., Bake loaves for 30-35 minutes until the internal temperature of the center of the loaves are 205-210*F. If they are below this temp, the loaves may be gummy., Take bread out of the oven when the bread reaches that temp range. Then, remove them from the baking pans to a wire rack to cool. (The parchment papers can be used as handles so you don't burn yourself.), Let the loaves cool completely before cutting into them! If you cut into them before they cool completely, they may be gummy on the inside., Once cooled completely, then slice to desired thickness, and enjoy!","[('flour', 560.0, 'g'), ('water', 360.0, 'g'), ('butter', 42.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 36.0, 'g'), ('honey', 60.0, 'g'), ('salt', 9.0, 'g'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('sourdough starter', 115.0, 'g')]"

If you have a pizza stone also place this in the oven. Otherwise, a normal oven plate is sufficient., It is a good idea to bake the pita breads two-by-two. This way it is easier to keep the high temperature in oven. The high temperature is important., Use the back of a dish to flatten two balls evenly. The thickness should be about 1/2 cm (1/5 inch). It is important that the bread is evenly flat and does not have any obviously large air pocket trapped inside (from the rising of the bread). It is a good idea to finish off by gently rolling the bread using a rolling pin - to let the air out., Gently, transfer two pita breads onto the hot stone inside the oven. Make sure that the side of the bread, which faced your kitchen table while fattening it, is now facing upwards away from the hot stone. This way the moistest part of the bread is facing way the hot stone. This is a little trick to make sure the bread is puffing up nicely., If you do not have a baking stone, use a parchment paper covered oven plate. Just make sure it is very hot., Bake the bread for about 5-6 minutes.

Add yeast and 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar and stir to combine. Allow to sit for about 5 minutes, until yeast is foamy (if yeast does not foam there is something wrong with it, it is likely dead. You will have to throw this out and start over)., Once yeast is foamy, add remaining 2 Tablespoons granulated sugar, salt, butter, and 2 cups (250g) of your flour mixture. Stir well until completely combined (the butter may not be completely combined at this point but as you add more flour it should mix into the dough completely)., Gradually add additional flour, stirring well after each addition (if you are using a stand mixer, stir on low-speed with a dough hook attachment), until dough clings together and forms a ball that pulls away from the side of the bowl. Dough should be slightly tacky to the touch but should not be sticky., Transfer to a clean surface and knead for about 5-10 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic (or continue to stir with mixer on low-speed with dough hook until smooth and elastic, about 3-5 minutes)., Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl, turn dough to coat the surface lightly with oil, cover and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in size (about 1-2 hours)., Once dough has doubled, transfer to a clean, lightly floured surface and use your hands to deflate the dough.

Add the flour and salt. Squish everything together with your hands until all of the flour is absorbed. The dough will be dry and shaggy. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, reusable wrap or a clean, very damp kitchen towel.

Let rest in a warm spot to rise. The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense and has doubled in size. This can take anywhere from 3-12 hours depending on the temperature of your ingredients, the potency of your starter and surrounding environment. For example, in the summer rise times can take anywhere between 2-4 hours @ 85º F/ 29º C whereas in the winter, the dough will take about 10-12 hours @ 68º F/ 20º C., Optional Step: Stretch & Fold the Dough, During bulk rise, you have the option to perform a series of ‘stretch & folds’ to strengthen the dough. Start 30 minutes into the bulk rise. Gather a portion of the dough, stretch it upwards and then fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl ¼ turn and repeat this process until you have come full circle to complete 1 set. Do this once or twice spaced about an hour apart. Although this step is not mandatory, it will increase the total volume and height of your bread. Click here for a step-by-step video tutorial., Cut & Shape the Dough, Divide your work surface in half; lightly flour one side (for cutting) and leave the other half clean (for shaping)., Remove the dough from the bowl, and place onto the floured section so that it does not stick. You do not need to ‘punch down’ the dough; it will gently deflate as you fold and shape it., Cut the dough in half to make 2 loaves, or leave it whole for a single loaf., To shape, use a bench scraper to move your dough to the non-floured section (if there is any flour present, it will be difficult to shape- brush away any excess). Starting at the top, fold the dough over toward the center. Give it a slight turn, and then fold over the next section of dough. Repeat until you have come full circle., Then flip the dough over and place it seam side down. Using your hands, gently cup the sides of the dough and rotate it, using quarter turns in a circular motion. You can also pull it towards you to even out the shape. Repeat this process until you are happy with its appearance. *See note below., Second Rise, Now the dough needs to rise again, but for a shorter period of time., Coat the bottom of your Dutch oven with cornmeal. Alternatively, use parchment paper to prevent sticking (this is what I do, now). Place the dough inside for a second shorter rise, about 30 minutes to 1 hour and cover with the lid of the pot or a very damp cloth. The dough ready when it is slightly puffy but not double in size., Preheat your oven to 450º F/ 232º C towards the tail end of the second rise., Score the Dough, Right before your bread goes into the oven, make a shallow slash about 2-3 inches long (or more) in the center of the dough. Use a bread lame, sharp pairing or a small serrated steak knife. The cut should be about 1/4-inch deep., Bake the Dough, Place the bread into the oven on the center rack (lid on) and reduce the temperature to 400° F/ 204° C. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the lid, and continue to bake (uncovered) for an additional 40 minutes or until deep, golden brown. Keep in mind that all ovens are different; you might have to make minimal adjustments to these temperatures., You can also take the internal temperature of your bread to double check that it is done. For sourdough, it should read about 205-210º F/ 96-98º C., Remove the bread from the oven, and cool on a wire rack for at least an hour before slicing.

Note: Add the flour slowly! It takes a while for the flour to absorb the liquids, and it's easy to add too much flour to this recipe., Mix (knead) on speed 2 for about 12 minutes. If dough seems sticky after this point, add another 1/4 cup of flour at a time until dough is a soft, moist, but not gooey-sticky texture. Add another minute of mixing with every 1/4 cup of flour added., If you did not need to add additional flour after 12 minutes, just continue mixing (kneading) for a total of 15 minutes (so, about 3 more minutes at this point). It's ok to add a few minutes to kneading time if you feel dough is not soft enough, though. You should reach the windowpane stage at this point, where you can stretch a small amount of dough and see through it, and it holds up without tearing., (Note: if kneading by hand, it should take nearly double the amount of kneading time above.), Transfer to a large bowl (at least twice the size of the dough). Cover with plastic wrap, then a kitchen towel.

Gently stir to mix., Allow the yeast to sit in a warm place for about 15 minutes, until it's activated and becomes frothy. This could take longer if your yeast was in the freezer. If the yeast doesn't activate (no frothy bubbles), then your yeast is likely too old and you will need it replaced with fresh yeast., Once the yeast is activated, you’re ready to make the bread dough., Bread loaf, To the proofed yeast mixture, add the flour, warm water, salt, honey, citric acid and melted butter., Using a dough whisk or a spatula, mix the ingredients to form a rough dough., Place the bowl in the mixer with a kneading hook attached, and knead the dough on low speed for about 2 - 5 minutes, until the dough comes together to form a ball., Increase the speed by 1 or 2 levels (speed 3 or 4 in a kitchen aid mixer) and knead the dough for a further 12 - 15 minutes until it's smooth and elastic., While the dough is kneading, check on it every few minutes to make sure it’s kneading well, and is not too dry or too wet. The dough is going to be very sticky and wet at the beginning, and become smoother as it's kneaded., To check if the dough has the right consistency after about 10 minutes of kneading - Increase the speed of the mixer to about 5 or 6 just for a minute or two. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, then it’s too wet, so add a little extra flour (a dusting at a time), to get the right texture. If the dough is still tacky but is coming off the sides (mostly), and only sticking to the bottom of the bowl, then it's at the right consistency. When you stop the mixer and lift the kneading hook from the bowl, and the dough isn’t sticking to the bottom of the bowl, then the dough might be too dry. You may need to add a little extra water (just ½ tsp at a time), to get the right consistency. The dough should be smooth, a little soft and tacky to the touch., Once the dough is kneaded, remove the dough hook and fold the dough over a few times by hand, to get a smooth ball. Then place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough proof for about 1 hour until it has at least doubled in size., While the dough is proofing, prepare the bread loaf pans. Butter 1 - 9 x 5 inch loaf pan for a very large loaf, or 2 - 8.5 x 4.5 inch loaf pans for smaller loaves, and set aside until the dough is ready., Turn the proofed dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Slightly flatten is with your hands. If making two smaller loaves, halve the dough with a sharp knife or bench scraper. (For more accurately halved dough, weigh the dough and then split it evenly by weight.) Place one portion of the dough back in the bowl and place it in the fridge while you shape the first portion., Gently press the dough into an evenly thick rectangle. The short side of this rectangle should be roughly about 8 - 8.5 inches (i.e. slightly shorter than the length of your bread loaf pan)., Next, tightly roll up the short side, along the length of the dough rectangle. Make sure to pinch / press the edge of the dough as you go, while rolling it up (read the post and see pictures for more details)., Once the dough is rolled up, pinch the seams to seal it, and tuck in the two sides and pinch these seams as well. Make sure all the seams are on one side (this will be the bottom) and the other side is smooth and seam-free (this will be the top)., Transfer this into the prepared loaf pan, seam side down, and press the dough into the pan. Make sure it’s evenly pressed into the bottom of the pan. Loosely cover the loaf pan with plastic wrap and let it proof again in a warm place, for about 45 minutes - 1 hour. The dough should double in size inside the loaf pan / pans., Repeat with the second portion of dough (if making two smaller loaves)., To check if it has proofed enough, gently press the top of the dough with your finger to leave an indentation that is about ½ cm deep. If proofed properly, this indentation should remain, or only bounce back slightly. If it bounces back almost completely, then it's underproofed. (Read the post and see pictures for more details.), Preheat the oven (conventional oven) to 375°F / 190°C, during the last 30 minutes of the second proofing time. It’s best for the oven to be preheated to the right temperature for at least 20 minutes before baking the bread., When the bread loaf is ready and the oven has preheated, place the loaf pans in the middle of the oven, and bake for 35 - 45 minutes. Make sure there is at least 2 inches of space between the pans to allow for proper air circulation. The bread is done when it sounds hollow when tapped on top, OR when the internal temperature reaches 195°F / 91°C., Remove the pans from the oven and keep in a warm place (away from drafts) to cool. After about 10 minutes, remove the bread from the pans and keep it on a wire rack to cool down completely. The bread is now ready to be served., Optional - brush melted butter on top while it's hot to add more buttery flavor., Keep the loaf (or loaves) in a bread box at room temperature for up to 4 - 5 days, or slice and keep in the freezer for up to 1 month.","[('yeast', 7.0, 'g'), ('water', 1.0, 'cup'), ('honey', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('flour', 19.5, 'ounces'), ('water', 0.5, 'cup'), ('salt', 1.25, 'tsp'), ('honey', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('citric acid', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('butter', 2.0, 'tbsp')]"

I like to knead by pulling in the corners of the dough with my fingers and then pressing down with heel of my hand, quickly and gently over and over again. While doing so, I continue to slowly add additional spoonfuls of flour. This will take about 10 minutes depending on how fast you knead. You know the dough is ready when it’s not too sticky, and very soft., After kneading, round out the dough into a ball; doesn’t have to be perfect. Grease or flour the bottom of a bowl, place dough in bowl, and cover. Let rise about 1 hour, or until doubled in size., Forming loaves, Grease two 9x5 inch pans. Punch down the risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. Gently work your dough into a thick rectangle (about 12x8) and fold into thirds. Roll it up, pinch the seams together, and gently throw your loaf on the work surface to release any last air bubbles. (There are many ways to form a loaf. Do what's comfortable and what works for you.), Place loaves in prepared pans, cover, and let rise again for about 30 minutes, or until the peak of the loaf is just arching over the rim of the pan. The dough should be soft and more airy. When you poke the dough, the mark should just barely slowly come back. If it bounces back immediately, it needs more proofing time. While dough rises, preheat oven to 350°F. (I like 375°F for high altitude), Bake, Once risen, brush the tops with an egg wash (1 egg + 1 tbsp of water mixed together). Top with additional oats if desired. This step is optional. You can also bake plain., Bake for about 25 minutes or until bottoms are golden brown. If the tops are browning too quickly, but still needs time to cook, you can cover tops with aluminum foil to slow down the browning.Transfer loaves to a cooling rack.

This step is necessary so that they don’t burn while baking the bread., Mix the whole wheat flour and the spelt flour in a large bowl. Add the spices and salt and incorporate them well., In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in lukewarm water. If it's too hot then it can kill the yeast, so it's best to stick to lukewarm water (around 110ºF/43ºC). This usually takes a few minutes., Add the yeast mixture into the flour bowl and mix until you obtain a sticky dough. (If you want to add some natural sweetener then add that at this point)., Knead the dough for about 10-15 minutes until it becomes uniform, soft and elastic. This can also be done in a stand mixer for between 8-10 minutes., Roll the dough into a ball, wet it with some olive oil, and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel and set aside for 1 hour so the dough can rise to around double its size., Remove the dough from the bowl, knocking out some air while you shape the dough into a 'loaf' shape that is slightly thinner than the width of your loaf tin (see video). The same goes for individual loaves - simply divide your dough evenly and shape accordingly.Note* If you want to add any seeds/additives into your bread, then you'd add them at this point, just after the first proving., Prepare your bread loaf tin and grease it or line it with baking paper or a bread tin liner. I use a paper liner, which I lightly flour., Place the shaped dough inside the tin. Then drain the presoaked seeds from any excess water and place them on top of the dough., Let the bread proof for another 45 minutes, covered with a damp tea towel. It should double in size, but make sure to not overprove as this can lead to deflated bread with a coarse texture., In the meantime, preheat the oven to 480ºF/250ºC. First place 2 baking trays as follows:-One tray in the middle of the oven – this is where the bread loaf tin goes-One tray in the bottom of the oven – this is where a bit of hot water goes just before baking the bread. The water helps keep the environment moist and will create a nice crispy crust for the loaf., When you are ready to bake, carefully pour a cup of water into the bottom tray (it will be hot so can steam immediately). Then place the bread on the middle shelf., Bake time will be between 15-20 minutes. If you want to be double sure that it has baked all the way through then you can use a thermometer and check for a temperature between 190-200ºF/~90ºC (although, I've never found this necessary), Once baked, set aside to cool down before you cut the bread. Storage:If the bread is not sliced yet, you can keep it unwrapped at room temperature. This way it will retain its freshness. Once sliced, keep well wrapped with a tea towel or foil at room temperature for 2-3 days. Alternatively, you can keep it in a bread box as those are meant to trap the moisture inside, so the bread doesn't dry out. To keep longer, freeze for up to 3 months. You can freeze the bread cut into slices, that way it's easy to take out and unfreeze as many as need. Remember, even if your bread has gone a bit stale then you can still use it for various things including croutons and bread pudding.","[('whole wheat flour', 250, 'grams'), ('wholemeal flour', 250, 'grams'), ('fresh yeast', 10, 'grams'), ('salt', 2, 'tsp'), ('mixed spices', 1.5, 'tbsp'), ('mixed seeds', 3, 'tbsp'), ('lukewarm water', 340, 'ml')]"

Pour boiling water on top. Let the mixture cool until a digital thermometer reads about 110°F (43°C). This usually takes 20 minutes. Pay attention to the temperature because if it’s too hot, it will kill the yeast. If it became too cool, however, it’s not a problem—the dough may just take a few extra minutes to rise., Whisk the yeast, sugar, and all of the warm water/cereal mixture in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to sit for 5-10 minutes or until foamy and bubbly on the surface., Add the butter, salt, and 1 cup (about 130g) flour. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula, then add another cup of flour. Beat on medium speed until relatively incorporated (there may still be chunks of butter). Add all of the remaining flour and the seeds/nuts (if using), then beat on medium speed until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes. If it seems too sticky, add more flour, 1 Tablespoon at a time until it begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. *If you do not own a mixer, you can mix this dough with a large wooden spoon or silicone spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle!*, Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 3-5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 3-5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st Rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter. Takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), Grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan., Shape the bread:, When the dough is ready, punch it down to release the air. Lightly flour a work surface, your hands, and a rolling pin. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 8×15 inches.

(It’s best to bake the bread towards the bottom of the oven so the top doesn’t burn.), Bake the bread, Bake for 35-40 minutes– if you notice the top browning too quickly during bake time, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil. How to test for doneness– give the loaf a light tap. If it sounds hollow, it’s done. For a more accurate test, the bread is done when an instant read thermometer reads the center of the loaf as 195°F-200°F (90°C-93°C)., Remove from the oven and allow bread to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.

Alternately, you can make this bread in a standing electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. Once the whole wheat flour is incorporated, begin to slowly add the all-purpose flour, 1 cup (130 g) at a time, until a shaggy dough forms., Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface, adding in as much of the remaining flour as possible without creating an overly dense dough. If the dough is difficult to knead and tough, then it has become too dense. You want the dough to be light, sticky, stretchy, and elastic. If the dough is sticking to the countertop and your hands, then it needs more flour., Once the dough is smooth and elastic, shape it into a ball.

Add water and mix well until there are no traces of flour. I use a sturdy wooden spatula for this, use your hands if you like. The dough will be very sticky. Cover with plastic wrap or a cover and leave to rise for 6-12 hours., Turn the dough onto a clean, unfloured work surface. Sprinkle a little flour over the dough and split it into two equally sized halves. Using a dough scrape, flip the two doughs so the floured surface faces down. Fold the edges of the dough towards the middle as if you were making an envelope. With the last move, roll the dough so the side with the folds faces down. Sprinkle a little flour over and leave to rest under a kitchen towel for 20-30 minutes. Usually doing this once is enough, but if the dough has flattened and spread out a lot, repeat the folding process and leave to rest for another 20-30 minutes before continuing., Mix equal parts of rice flour and white flour (or use wholemeal flour) and line the proofing baskets with plenty of the mixture. If using regular bread tins, cover with a kitchen towel lined with plenty of the flour mixture., When ready to shape the breads, sprinkle the doughs with a little flour and brush off any excess. Flip and shape into a batard, i.e. a bread shape. There are many ways of doing this, see “How to shape a bread” in notes below for my method. Once shaped, place in the proofing baskets, seam side up. Sprinkle a little flour on top, cover with a kitchen towel and leave to rise until doubled or nearly doubled in size, 2-3 hours. If you’re in a hurry you may do it after 1 hour. Your bread will still be great, though the texture may be a little on the bouncy side., Place the baking stone (if using) in the second lowest rack. Preheat the oven to 260 °C, or as hot as it goes if less. Make sure to do this at least 30–45 minutes before to ensure the baking stone gets sufficiently hot. If using a regular oven tray you only need to make sure the oven is properly hot before baking. Place a tray at the bottom of the oven to splash the water onto., When ready to bake, cover a pizza spade with baking parchment (or use something else you can use to slide the bread into the oven with). Invert the breads onto the baking parchment. Make a 3-4 cm (1-1.5 in) deep incision along the length of the top of the bread at a near horizontal angle. This ensures the dough will rise beautifully in the oven rather than exploding where it feels like. Transfer to the baking stone as quickly as possible. Throw the hot water into the tray at the bottom of the oven and immediately close the oven door immediately. Lower the temperature to 230 °C and bake until golden and cooked through, 35–40 minutes. Open the oven door to release steam after approximately 20 minutes. If you're unsure if the bread is done, insert an oven thermometer.

Slide the bread loaf pan right onto the middle rack of the oven and close the oven door (the steam from the water in the small pan will help to keep the oven moist and allow the bread to rise more, instead of forming a crust right away.), Bake the loaf for about 30 minutes, or, until the top is a deep golden brown (the internal temperature of the bread will be around 190°F). When you remove the loaf from the oven, you will hear it crackle for a while. In baking terms, this is called ""singing"" and it is exactly what you want.

Glass is always good as you can see what's happening underneath your dough. This recipe is based on you having an active starter that you have fed a few hours before starting your bake.Mix the water and starter together briefly. Then add your flour and salt and mix whole lot together to form a shaggy dough. I find a dough scraper the easiest way to mix it as you can keep the sides of bowl clean.The dough will be fairly shaggy and only just brought together (see photo). You might wonder how this will turn into bread, but just wait, time is your friend and the dough will change in around an hour., Cover your bowl with cling film or a damp tea towel and let it sit for around 1 hour. It's ok if it's a little bit longer, it's not going to matter too much.This process is called the ""autolyse"" and allows your flour to soak in all the water and become hydrated. You can see how the dough has changed in this photo., Forming Up The DoughAfter the dough has been through autolyse you need to bring it together into a ball. Work your way around the bowl, grabbing the dough from the outside, stretching it up and over itself, into the centre, until a smooth ball is formed. You shouldn't need more than about 20-25 stretches to form the ball.You'll notice that the dough is fully hydrated after soaking all the water up. It will be fairly sticky but as you bring it into a ball, it will become smoother and shinier., Once the dough has formed into a smooth ball, pop the cling film back on and let it rest for 30 minutes., Stretch & Fold + Adding Parmesan & RosemaryOver the next few hours you need to create some structure for your dough by ""stretching and folding"", as well as incorporating the rosemary and parmesan.Aim to do around 4-6 sets of stretches and folds. For each set, stretch the dough up and over itself 4 times. Leave around 15 minutes in between each set. Again you do not have to be exact with time, but you need to do at least 4 sets over 2 hours.You'll need to add the parmesan and rosemary around the second set of stretch and folds., Bulk FermentOnce you've finished your stretch and folds, place the cling film or damp tea towel back over your dough and let it rest and ferment. See notes below for more info on this step., Shaping The DoughOnce your dough has finished it's first ferment, it's time to shape it into either a boule or a batard (or couronne if you have one)., Placing Into A BannetonOnce the dough is shaped into a tight ball, place it into your banneton smooth side down, so your seam is on the top - this way the top of your dough will get the pretty lines from the banneton. If you're using a cloth or tea towel in a bowl it's ok to put your dough with the smooth side up. Just make sure the dough is tight.Lift your dough around the edges to pop a little more rice flour if you feel it needs it. Just try to handle the dough as little as possible and be really gentle as you really want to preserve all the gases and air bubbles that have formed during your bulk ferment., Cold FermentNow the dough is in its ""shaping container"" cover it loosely with a plastic bag or damp tea towel and place into the fridge. I use a large plastic bag to cover it - I just reuse it each time. Try to leave it in the fridge for a minimum 5 hours up to a maximum of around 36 hours. The longer you leave it the better your bread will be! A longer cold ferment creates beautiful blisters on your crust and a deeper sourdough flavour. It will also ensure your dough forms a skin which makes it easier to score., Preparing To BakeOnce you're ready to bake your sourdough, you'll need to preheat your oven to 230C/450F. Place your Dutch Oven into the oven when you turn it on so it gets hot. Try to preheat for around 1 hour to ensure your oven is super hot - but you know your oven so just adjust this time if you need to.Leave your dough in the fridge until the very last minute - placing a cold dough into a hot oven will give you a great ""spring""., Bake Time!Now it's time to bake!When your oven is at temperature, take your sourdough out of the fridge. Gently place it onto a piece of baking paper. Make sure that you make the baking paper big enough to use the edges as a handle to lower to dough into your Dutch Oven.Gently score your bread with a lame, clean razor blade or knife. At minimum a large cross is sufficient, but you can get as artistic as you like. Try to score it fairly deep to ensure the dough opens up.Carefully take your dutch oven out of the oven. Place the sourdough into the pot using the baking paper as a handle. Put the lid on and place into the hot oven. If you want to you can spritz your dough with extra water before you put the lid on.BAKE TIME:30 Minutes with the lid on at 230C/450F plus10-15 Minutes with the lid off at 210C/410F, Finishing The BakeWhen you remove your dough from the oven, carefully remove it from the dutch oven as soon as possible and place on a wire rack to cool.","[('bread flour', 500.0, 'g'), ('water', 350.0, 'g'), ('sourdough starter', 50.0, 'g'), ('parmesan cheese', 150.0, 'g'), ('salt', 10.0, 'g'), ('rosemary', 1.0, None)]"

In summer, I use cooler water, about 55- 60 F (13-16 C) to slow down and control the rise.","Make the Dough, In a large bowl, whisk the starter, water, and sugar together with a fork. Add the flour and salt. Combine to form a rough dough, then finish mixing by hand until no lumps of our remain. The dough will be very stiff and dry. Note: it’s important to use a large mixing bowl- this dough is strong and rises quite high. As a mixing alternative, use a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook; run on low speed for 5 to 6 minutes to combine and knead., Cover the dough with a very damp towel and let rest for 45 minutes to 1 hour. After the dough has rested, work the mass into a semi-smooth ball, about 15 to 20 seconds., Bulk Rise, Cover the bowl with plastic wrap that has been lightly coated in oil to prevent sticking. Let rise until double in size, about 10-12 hrs when the temperature is 68 F (20 C); 8 to 10 hours @ 70°F (21°C). Note: in the summer, rise the dough during the day. Once the dough is almost double in size, cover and chill the whole bowl overnight (it will continue to rise slightly in the fridge). Proceed using the cold dough the following day., Shape, Line a sheet pan with a nonstick silicone mat or parchment paper. If using parchment, lightly coat with cooking spray or oil to prevent sticking., Remove the dough onto a non- floured work surface. Flatten the dough into a rectangle and divide into 8 equal pieces, about 115 g (4 oz) each. Gather the ends, flip the dough over, and roll each piece into a ball. Let the dough rest on your lined sheet pan for 10 to 15 minutes to relax the gluten., Working with one ball of dough at a time, poke a hole straight through the center. Move your finger around in a circular motion to gently stretch the dough until the hole is about the size of a walnut. You can also lift up the dough, insert both index fingers through the center hole, and barrel roll to gently stretch the opening. When finished, place the dough back onto the sheet pan. It’s okay if the hole shrinks slightly. Repeat shaping the remaining dough., Second Rise, Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. The dough will puff up only slightly at this stage., Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the honey and whisk well to dissolve. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Add the seeds to a rimmed tray or shallow bowl., Boil the bagels, Add 2 to 3 bagels into the pot and simmer for 30 seconds on each side for a thin crust. Note: if using cold dough from the fridge, the bagels might not float to the surface right away. Give them a nudge after 30 seconds or so and be patient. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bagels back the sheet pan you used earlier, placing them rounded side up., Once slightly cool but still wet, dip the rounded side of the bagels into the seeds to coat. Place back onto the sheet pan and finish boiling the rest of the bagels., =""instruction-step-11"">Bake, Bake, Place your sheet pan on the center rack. Bake the bagels for about 20 to 25 minutes.

Mix on low speed until homogenous, then switch to the dough hook. Knead on medium speed for 8 to 10 minutes, until the dough starts to pull away from the side of the bowl; it will remain tacky and stick to the bowl in some places.  , Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl or container, like a 2-quart dough rising bucket, and let it rise at room temperature for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until puffy. Transfer the container to the refrigerator to continue rising for at least 4 hours and up to overnight. When the dough is finished rising, it will have doubled in size and be much firmer and less tacky. , Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and divide it in half (290g per piece). Roll each piece into a 15"" log that’s about 1"" wide, then use a bench knife or kitchen scissors to cut each log into fifteen 1"" pieces. (Each piece should be about 19g; the pieces don't have to be perfectly even, but the more uniform they are, the more beautiful your star will turn out.) Roll into 30 neat balls. , Line a large cookie sheet, a rimless sheet pan, or an upside-down rimmed baking sheet with a piece of parchment; lightly grease the parchment.  , Unwrap the Brie and use a sharp serrated knife to cut the rind off the top; discard the rind. Rewrap the Brie and keep it at room temperature as the bread proofs and bakes. If your Brie comes in a sturdy outer container that’s not made of plastic, wrap the bottom portion of the container completely in aluminum foil, and then lightly grease the outside. Place the foil-wrapped container in the center of the parchment. If your Brie didn’t come in a sturdy container, see “tips,” below. , To make a 5-point star, arrange 15 balls around the Brie container in a tight circle, leaving about 1/4"" to 1/2"" of space between the container and the balls (they will expand as they proof and bake). Make 5 points, using 3 balls arranged in a triangle for each point, evenly around the circle. The balls should touch but don’t need to be tightly packed. (You can also make a 6-point star by arranging 12 balls more loosely around the container, then using the remaining 18 balls to make the points.) , Cover the baking sheet and allow the dough to rise at warm room temperature for about 1 hour, until puffy. Towards the end of the rise time, preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the center., Brush the risen dough thoroughly with the egg wash, then repeat a second time. Sprinkle generously with flaky salt., Bake the bread for 15 to 20 minutes, until deeply golden brown. Remove the bread from the oven and lower the temperature to 300°F. Use tongs to carefully remove and discard the foil-wrapped container. Allow the bread (and oven) to cool for at least 5 to 10 minutes. (See “tips,” for details on how to pause the recipe here and then easily finish it to serve at a gathering)., Place the room temperature wheel of Brie in the empty space in the center, then top with the jam. , Return the pan to the oven and bake the bread with the Brie in it for 10 to 15 minutes, until the Brie is soft and gooey. Meanwhile, melt the butter and rosemary sprig on the stove over medium-low heat until the butter begins to brown and the rosemary sizzles, about 2 minutes. , Once the bread is baked, promptly brush it with the rosemary butter. If you’d like, tuck additional rosemary sprigs decoratively around the Brie wheel to make a crown.

20e4d7e2,https://notjustfood.blog/aromatic-rosemary-sourdough-bread/,Aromatic Rosemary Sourdough Bread,"35 g sourdough starter, 35 g lukewarm water, 70 g bread flour, 120 g active leaven, 225 g lukewarm water, 250 g bread flour, 30 g whole grain rye flour, 7 g salt, 4 g finely chopped, fresh rosemary (about two to three sprigs)","In the morning, make the leaven: Add the sourdough starter and water to a mason jar. Stir until the starter is fully dissolved. Then, add the flour and mix to combine. The leaven will have a stiff, dough-like consistency. To ensure that the flour is fully incorporated, you can briefly knead the leaven on the counter, until it feels smooth and elastic. Place it back into the jar, cover it loosely with a lid, and let it rise in a warm spot (ideally between 26 °C and 29 °C) for about 4–6 hours, or until it has doubled (or tripled) in size. It’s ripe and ready to use when it looks airy and has a mild, yogurt-like aroma. Please keep in mind that the actual time it takes for the dough to rise may vary depending on your room temperature and the activity of your starter. In a cooler environment, the dough will need more time to rise. Always make sure, to only use the leaven when it has at least doubled in volume. This ensures that it’s strong and active enough to raise the bread dough., Once the leaven is ripe and ready to use, prepare the main dough: Add the leaven, lukewarm water, and flour to a mixing bowl. Using a dough whisk or wooden spoon, mix the ingredients until a shaggy dough forms. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel and let it rest on the counter for about 30 minutes. This allows the flour to fully absorb the water and jumpstarts the gluten development., After the bench rest, add the salt. Dimple it in with wet fingers and evenly distribute it throughout the dough. Next, drizzle in the olive oil and knead it in with your hands, until fully incorporated. Lightly wet your worksurface with a bit of water and dump the dough onto it. Perform a few rounds of the slap & fold technique, to strengthen the dough and develop structure. It will take about 5 minutes until the dough changes from being sticky to becoming smooth and elastic. Once the dough feels smooth, transfer it to a lightly greased bowl for the bulk fermentation and cover it with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap., Let the dough rise in a warm spot (26 °C to 28 °C) for about 4 hours in total. After the first hour, perform a set of coil folds to further strengthen the dough. After the second hour, laminate the dough to add the freshly chopped rosemary. Fold the dough back together into a tight package and continue to let it rise for another two hours. By the end of the bulk fermentation, the dough should have increased in size by about 50%–75%. It should look airy and contain lots of smaller and bigger bubbles. If it hasn’t risen much after 4 hours and still looks compact, let it rise longer and/or transfer it to a warmer place. The time it takes for the dough to rise depends on the proofing temperature and the activity of the starter. The warmer it is, the faster the dough will rise. In a cooler environment, the dough might need 6 - 8 hours to rise. For best results, always keep an eye on the dough and look for visual cues, such as the increase in size and the development of air bubbles, to help ensure it's properly proofed., After the bulk fermentation, dump the dough out on a lightly floured work surface and pre-shape it loosely into a round shape. Let it rest on the counter for about 30 minutes. Then, using a bench scraper, flip it over and shape it into a batard. Place it in a floured banneton and loosely cover it with plastic wrap, or put it in a plastic bag. Place the dough in the fridge overnight., The next morning, pre-heat the oven to 240 °C with the Dutch oven inside. Once it’s pre-heated, carefully take the Dutch oven out and turn the bread dough out of the banneton directly into the Dutch oven. Use a bread lame or a serrated knife to cut one long slash lengthwise along the top of the dough. Place the lid of the Dutch oven back on and load it into the oven. Reduce the temperature to 230 °C and bake the bread for 15 minutes. Then, remove the lid, reduce the temperature to 220 °C, and bake for another 15 minutes, or until the crust is crispy and deeply golden brown. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack before slicing. This allows the internal moisture to redistribute evenly throughout the loaf and sets the crumb, resulting in better texture and flavor. Slicing the bread, while still warm, can result in a sticky and gummy crumb. The wait is worth it! This bread is delicious to serve alongside soups, stews, or antipasti platters. Stored at room temperature in a bread box or linen bag, it will stay fresh for about 3–4 days.","[('sourdough starter', 35.0, 'g'), ('lukewarm water', 35.0, 'g'), ('bread flour', 70.0, 'g'), ('active leaven', 120.0, 'g'), ('lukewarm water', 225.0, 'g'), ('bread flour', 250.0, 'g'),('whole grain rye flour', 30.0, 'g'), ('salt', 7.0, 'g'), ('fresh rosemary', 4.0, 'g')]"

Decide on a timeframe. The dough is stirred together; rests for 10 hours; is put into a crock; rises for 2 hours, and bakes for 45 minutes. So that's just under 13 hours. It's a good weekend bread; stir it together Friday night at about 10 p.m.; scoop it into the crock about 8 a.m. Saturday; bake about 10 a.m., and your bread will be baked, cooled, and ready to slice by noon., , , Be sure you have something to bake the bread in, namely a 4- to 4 1/2-quart round, deep covered crock, Dutch oven, or casserole dish. It must be oven-safe (obviously); it really does need a lid, and it has to be deep enough (about 4"") to hold the rising dough.,   ,         ,   , , To make the dough: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Place all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Stir to combine. At first the dough will stick to the spoon and follow it around the bowl. But once all the flour is completely absorbed (after about 10 seconds of vigorous stirring), the dough will become softer and stick to the sides of the bowl. That's it; you're done stirring.,   ,         ,   , , Cover the bowl and set the dough aside to rest at cool room temperature for 10 to 12 hours. If it's very hot and humid, do your best to find a cooler spot; about 68°F to 70°F is ideal. After its rest, the dough should be very bubbly and will have risen quite a bit.,   ,         ,   , , Grease your chosen crock with non-stick vegetable oil spray, then sprinkle with cornmeal or semolina, for a nicely crunchy crust. Be sure the crock is well-greased; the last thing you want is for the baked bread to stick.,   ,         ,   , , Gently stir the dough down, and scoop it into the greased crock. Add the lid and let the dough rest and rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours at cool room temperature; again, 68°F to 70°F is ideal. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450°F.,   ,         ,   , , Check the dough before putting it in the oven; it will have risen about 1/2"" and show some large bubbles on the surface, though it’ll be flat across the top, not domed. Shake the crock very gently; the dough should jiggle a bit.,   ,         ,   , , To bake the bread: Bake the bread for 45 minutes with the lid on. Remove the lid and bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, until the top of the loaf is golden brown with deeper brown blisters (from the bubbles).

Set aside for five minutes., Add oil and honey and stir to combine., Beat 4 whole eggs plus 2 egg yolks in a separate bowl (discard or save the leftover egg whites for another purpose)., Add the eggs and salt to the liquid mixture and stir to combine completely., Kneading the dough with a stand mixer, Add 930g of the flour to the bowl of the mixer, then add the liquid mixture to the flour. Reserve the remaining 70g flour. Attach the dough hook and lock the mixer head in the down position. Start the mixer on its lowest speed to combine the ingredients., Once all the flour has been incorporated, increase the mixer speed to medium-low to knead and run it for about 7-8 minutes. If you see a lot of dough sticking to the sides, add in 1 tbsp of the reserved flour and let it become fully incorporated. You may need to do this 3 or 4 more times during this step., After 8 minutes, stop the mixer and use a flexible dough scraper (silicone spatula is fine too) to scrape down the sides of the bowl. The dough should be tacky but not impossibly sticky at this point; if it is impossibly sticky (i.e., you can't rub your hands together and get the dough completely off your fingers), add another tbsp of the reserved flour to the bowl and knead another minute or two., Test the dough strength with the windowpane test: tear off a chunk of dough approximately 2 tbsp in size. Hold the piece of dough up to a window or light, and, using your fingers, pinch and stretch the dough into as thin and flat a shape as you can. If you can stretch the dough so that light comes through the dough without the dough tearing, the dough is ready for its first rise. If the windowpane tears, return the dough to the ball and knead for another minute or two and test again. Note: the dough probably doesn't need any more flour at this point, just more kneading., Depending on the size of your mixer, you may find as the dough nears completion, it may start creeping over the top of the dough hook. If that's the case, it's best to pull it out of the mixer and complete by hand. Use the dough scraper to release the dough from the bowl and hook and transfer to countertop to knead by hand. The dough may seem very sticky coming out of the bowl, but use the dough scraper to release the dough from the countertop, adding a little flour only when absolutely necessary. As you knead by hand, some dough may stick to the countertop as you pick up the dough and rotate it. If it's a very small amount of dough, scrape it up with the dough scraper and continue kneading. If a lot of dough is staying on the countertop, add 1 tbsp of the reserved flour and knead it in. The dough will become less sticky as it gains strength., Once the dough passes the windowpane test and is not overly sticky, skip to ""Rising the dough"" below., Kneading the dough by hand, Add 930g flour to a large mixing bowl, then add the liquid mixture and stir with a mixing spoon or dough whisk to mix thoroughly. Reserve the remaining 70g flour., It can be easier to start the kneading right in the bowl, but you can also turn out the mixture onto a countertop dusted with 1 tbsp of the reserved flour. Your goal is to use as little of the reserved flour as possible. The dough will become less sticky on its own as it gains strength., Kneading technique: Gather into a ball and flatten. Pull the top of the flattened ball and fold over the bottom, then use the heel of your hand to seal the fold. Pick up the dough, turn it 90 degrees, and repeat the process. If it's too difficult to pick up the dough cleanly from the counter with your hands, use a flexible plastic dough scraper to pick it up, and sprinkle 1 tbsp of the reserved flour in the bowl or on the countertop, and return the dough and knead until incorporated. Knead for about 8-10 minutes., At this point the dough should be tacky but not impossibly sticky — you should be able to rub your hands together and get all the dough off cleanly. If not, add 1 tbsp of the reserved flour and knead another 1-2 minutes., Test the dough strength with the windowpane test: tear off a chunk of dough approximately 2 tbsp in size. Hold the piece of dough up to a window or light, and, using your fingers, pinch and stretch the dough into as thin and flat a shape as you can. If you can stretch the dough so that light comes through the dough without the dough tearing, the dough is ready for its first rise (skip to ""Rising the dough"" below). If the windowpane tears, return the dough to the ball and knead for another minute or two and test again. Note: the dough probably doesn't need any more flour at this point, just more kneading., Rising the dough, Oil a large mixing bowl or food-safe tub (with a tight-fitting lid)., Form the dough into a tight ball, pulling gently down at the sides so that the dough is taut, and pinch underneath to seal., Place the ball of dough in the bowl or tub, turning to coat all sides in the oil, then cover (for a bowl, use plastic wrap or a kitchen towel; for a food-safe tub, use the tight-fitting lid)., Set aside in a warm (80-100°F), draft-free spot and let rise until doubled in size. Because of the lower amount of yeast compared to other recipes, the first rise will likely take significantly longer than other recipes might indicate (see note about yeast types and rising times). In a spot that's about 80°, the first rise can take about 2.5-3 hours. A spot that's closer to 90-100° will rise more quickly. Don't put the dough in an environment hotter than that., When the dough has completed its first rise, take the dough out of the bowl or tub (it probably will not come out completely cleanly; that's a good thing, just scrape it all together) and deflate it, reshaping into a tight ball as before and returning to the bowl or tub and cover for its second rise, which should take about 1/3 the time of the initial rise. When the dough has once again doubled in volume, the second rise is done. (Note: many bakers opt to skip this step, but I find the difference in quality to be worth the extra time and tiny effort.), Shaping, Challah is known for being a braided loaf. There are countless ways to braid a loaf; in this recipe I'll explain how to create the six-strand braid seen in the photo., Have a kitchen scale, dough scraper, and rolling pin on hand. Line two half-sheet pans with one piece of parchment or a silicone baking mat each. It's best to bake each loaf individually for the deepest color and an even doneness., Weigh the completed dough, which should be approximately 1800g. Divide in half and set aside one of the halves (each half makes one challah)., Working the first half, divide the dough into six equal pieces. Use the kitchen scale to measure precisely (tip: weigh in grams for easier math). It's perfectly ok to tear off little chunks to move between pieces to achieve pieces of equal weight. Once you've separated the dough into six equal pieces, form each into a tight ball, again stretching the sides down and pinching on the bottom., Making the ropes: Start with the first of the six balls you created, flip it over so the bottom of the ball is showing, and flatten the ball evenly on the countertop. You should not need any additional flour at this point — if your dough passed the windowpane test earlier, it should be strong enough to release from the countertop easily but also stick just enough to do the work you need to do.Using the rolling pin and starting from the center, roll up and down until you have a very flat (1/4"" thick) elongated oval. Use the heel of your hand to flatten the corners so if forms an evenly flat rectangle.Roll the rectangle tightly up on the long side to form a cigar shape. Roll the rope back and forth, pressing a little heavier on each end until you have a long, even rope about 1 inch/3cm thick with tapered ends. Pinch the seam shut, roll the rope a few more times to help the seal tighten, and set the rope aside, seam side down, while you complete the remaining ropes., Once all the ropes are done, the first ones will likely have contracted and thickened a little, and the seam may have reopened. Just pinch it shut again. Gently roll the ropes to lengthen them out again and make them even with each other, approximately an inch in diameter and 15 inches long. It's important to roll gently but assertively—you don't want to rip the strands of gluten. Finish each rope by tapering about an inch on each end even more, to about 1/4"" diameter., Creating a six-strand braid: Clear a large countertop or work surface. Arrange the ropes, seam side down, like the diagram here, where it looks like a stick figure with no head, two arms, and four legs. Pinch all ropes together at the top middle spot. Keep the seam sides down as you do the braid.Take the left arm (A) and swing it down just to the left of the inside right leg (D). This rope becomes the new D. Now move the outside right leg (E) up to become the new right arm (A). Repeat on the left: bring the right arm (F) down just to the left of the inside left leg (C). This is now the new C. Move the outside left leg (B) up to become the new right arm (F). Repeat, starting with A as before. When you can't braid further, pinch the bottom ends tightly together and tuck underneath the loaf. The top ends were already pinched when you began. Pinch again and tuck underneath the loaf, pinching underneath to seal the tucked end to the underside., Move the finished loaf to one of the parchment-lined half-sheet pans and cover with plastic wrap., Wait 10-15 minutes, then shape the second loaf and set aside on the second parchment-lined half-sheet pan and cover with plastic wrap., Final rise, Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until it has become large and puffy, about 50% larger in volume. Check the rise every 30 minutes or so. This may take two hours even in a warm kitchen with this recipe. It's important to complete this final rise; otherwise the braids may pull apart too much in baking. (But also don't overproof, which can lead to flatter finished results.) The more you do this, the better sense you'll have of how long this process takes in your kitchen and you can leave it alone longer., In the last half hour of the final rise, preheat the oven to 350°F., Make the egg wash: beat the remaining egg in a small dish along with 1 teaspoon of water until it has a very even consistency. Just before baking, brush the egg wash all over the loaf, making sure there are no dry spots. Save the egg wash, as you'll be reapplying it during the bake., Baking and cooling, Bake in the center of the oven for 15 minutes, then take out and apply another egg wash., Optional: at this point you can add toppings such as poppy seeds, sesame seeds, everything bagel seasoning, etc. Sprinkle over the loaf after the egg wash., Return to the oven and bake another 15-20 minutes, until the top is deeply golden and an instant-read thermometer registers 190-200° in the thickest part. Another way to check doneness is to flip the loaf over and thump it with the back of a spoon. If it makes a hollow sound, the loaf is probably ready to take out of the oven. Slide off the parchment onto a cooling rack and let cool for at least an hour. It doesn't need to be completely cool before you slice into it, but it does finish its baking during that first hour of cooling., After the bread is completely cool, you can store it in a plastic bag for 3-4 days. For the prettiest slices, slice diagonally across the bumps.","[('water', 240.0, 'g'), ('yeast', 13.0, 'g'), ('vegetable oil', 125.0, 'g'), ('honey', 165.0, 'g'), ('salt', 28.0, 'g'), ('eggs', 6.0, None), ('bread flour', 1000.0, 'g'), ('egg', 1.0, None)]"

You want a moist and firm dough after you have mixed it., On a floured countertop, knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. Try working in as much flour as possible to form a firm and stiff dough., Lightly brush a large bowl with oil and turn the dough to coat. Cover the bowl with a damp dish towel. Let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until the dough has doubled in size. Punch the dough down, and let it rest for another 10 minutes., Carefully divide the dough into 8 pieces (I used a scale to be extra precise, but it’s not necessary). Shape each piece into a round. Now, take a dough ball, and press it gently against the countertop (or whatever work surface you’re using) moving your hand and the ball in a circular motion pulling the dough into itself while reducing the pressure on top of the dough slightly until a perfect dough ball forms (as pictured). Repeat with 7 other dough rounds., Coat a finger in flour, and gently press your finger into the center of each dough ball to form a ring. Stretch the ring to about ⅓ the diameter of the bagel and place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet. Repeat the same step with the remaining dough., After shaping the bagels and placing them on the cookie sheet, cover with a damp kitchen towel and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 425ºF / 220ºC / Gas Mark 7., Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Reduce the heat. Use a slotted spoon or skimmer to lower the bagels into the water. Boil as many as you are comfortable with boiling. Once the bagels are in, it shouldn’t take too long for them to float to the top (a couple seconds). Let them sit there for 1 minute, and then flip them over to boil for another minute. Extend the boiling times to 2 minutes each, if you’d prefer a chewier bagel (results will give you a more New York-Style bagel with this option)., If you want to add toppings to your bagels, do so as you take them out of the water. Alternatively, you can use an egg wash to get the toppings to stick before baking the bagels. You may want to use the “Optional Toppings” listed above to top the bagels.

This took my dough 4-5 hours on the Raisenne dough riser at 80-85F. Expect longer rising time at lower dough/ambient temperatures., Shaping and Final Proof, Scrape the dough out of your bowl or bucket onto a floured work surface and shape it to suit the form of your proofing basket and baking vessel. If your dough is lacking tension (not holding its shape), feel free to do a pre-shape and 15 minute bench rest to strengthen it before the final shaping., Place the dough seam-side up in a floured proofing basket. Cover and let the dough rise at room temperature for 20-40 minutes, then refrigerate overnight (8-16 hours). If your dough is warm like mine, you may want to refrigerate immediately; and if it is cold, you may want to refrigerate the basket after closer to 1 hour. You can also bake the dough the same day if you proof for 1-2 hours at room temperature. And you have the option to place the dough in the freezer for 20 minutes to stiffen it during some of the oven preheat., Baking, About 30 minutes before the end of the final proof, begin preheating your baking vessel and oven to 500F., Flip the dough out of the proofing basket and onto a sheet of parchment paper. Brush off excess flour on the dough, then brush on the egg white (or starch glaze described in the notes), sprinkle with caraway seeds, and score lines or any other pattern you like., Place the dough in your preheated baking vessel, cover and return the vessel to the oven.

Sprinkle yeast on top. Place the bowl in a warm place for about 10-15 minutes. Be patient! If yeast is activated, you will see foam on top of the mixture, and even a few small bubbles. Also, if you take sniff, it will smell very much like yeast., Gently stir in flour and salt. Add the other cup of water and mix until just combined into a sticky, shaggy dough. Cover with a towel and let rest for 45 minutes., This step includes 4 repetitions of ""folding"" and ""resting"" for a total of 3 hours resting time: Instead of dusting your hands with flour, wet your hands with a little water and ""fold"" the dough: Leaving the dough in the bowl, stretch one side of the dough up and then over the top of the dough. Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat until you've done each side. Flip the dough over, cover, and let rest another 45 minutes. Repeat this folding and resting process 3 more times., Shape the Dough, After the fourth resting period is done, take the dough out of the bowl and place on a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. If you have a scale, use it to weight each piece to make sure each is the same amount., Shape each piece into a rectangle and gently stretch out the ends. Cover with an oiled piece of plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes., After resting, sprinkle each rectangle with a little bit of flour, a very light dusting so your hands don't stick. Fold each rectangle in half lengthwise and flip over seam side down. Gently roll each piece into a roughly 15 inch long log about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Gently stretch out the ends again and using your fingertips press them together into a point, forming the baguette shape., Gently move the baguettes onto a bakers couche or make your own using a lightly floured towel (I used a large tea towel): using the towel, create a ridge between each baguette (think taco stand). This will make sure the baguettes maintain their shape while you let them rest for the final time. Cover with an oiled piece of plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes., Bake the Baguettes, While the baguettes are resting, turn your oven on to preheat to 450˚F. During the last 10 minutes of rest time, place a pan on the bottom rack of the oven and fill with boiling water., Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper. VERY carefully move each baguette on to the tray. Spray each baguette with a little water. Dust the tops lightly with flour. Score each one with 4 to 5 overlapping lines about 1/4 inch deep., Being careful of the steam, open the oven and place the tray with the baguettes on the center rack. Spray a little more water into the oven to make sure there is enough steam., Bake for 16-18 minutes, rotating the whole tray halfway through, until baguettes are a deep golden brown and sound hollow when the bottom is tapped.

Flip it seam side down onto a part of the work surface that isn’t covered in flour and rotate in place to seal the seams., Place the dough into a 7 inch round proofing basket that you’ve dusted with some brown rice flour with the seams facing upwards. Cover with a damp tea towel and proof in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size., While the loaf is proofing, pre-heat the oven to 480 ºF (250 ºC) with a cast iron skillet on the middle rack or a Dutch oven/combo cooker on the lower middle rack. If you’re using a skillet, place a baking tray on the bottom rack of the oven., Once the dough has doubled in size, turn it out of the bread basket onto a piece of baking paper and score the top with a pattern of choice (the easiest pattern is a cross, about ¼ – ½ inch deep), using a bread lame or sharp knife. Take the hot cast iron skillet or Dutch oven/combo cooker out of the oven and then transfer the bread along with the baking paper into it.For a skillet or combo cooker, this is easiest by sliding a pizza peel or baking sheet underneath the baking paper and then using it to slide the bread along with the baking paper gently into the hot skillet/combo cooker. For a Dutch oven, use the sides of the baking paper as handles to transfer the bread into it., If using a skillet: place the skillet in the oven, pour hot water into the bottom baking tray, add 3 – 4 ice cubes around the bread (between the baking/greaseproof paper and the skillet), and close the oven door., If using a Dutch oven/combo cooker: add 3 – 4 ice cubes around the bread (between the baking/greaseproof paper and the walls of the Dutch oven/combo cooker) and close it, then place it into the pre-heated oven., Bake at 480 ºF (250 ºC) with steam for 20 minutes – don’t open the Dutch oven or the oven doors during this initial period, as that would allow the steam to escape out of the oven., After the 20 minutes, remove the bottom tray with water from the oven (for cast iron skillet) or uncover the Dutch oven/combo cooker, reduce the oven temperature to 450 ºF (230 ºC), and bake for a further 40 - 50 minutes in a steam-free environment.

(See video above for step by step.), Then, flip the whole mass of dough such that the seams of your folds face down against the bottom of the bowl. At this point, the dough will have become considerably more smooth, which is the goal., Repeat this process 3 more times: Rest the dough for another 30 minutes, then stretch and fold again exactly the same as before. All in all, you will have rest the dough for four 30 minutes increments and stretched and folded in between.

Using the dough hook, mix/knead for about 5 minutes, adding bits of extra flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the bowl., Meanwhile, set the oven to “proof” setting (or warm it to the lowest temp and turn the oven light on, then turn off the oven). When the dough is soft and pliable, remove it from the bowl, add a little drizzle of olive oil to the bottom, then put the dough back in and roll it around to coat it in oil. Let it proof in the oven for 1 – 2 hours, until it’s doubled in size., Cut the dough into 6 roughly-equal pieces (I cut in half, then cut each half in thirds.) Shape the hoagies by flattening each piece with your hands, then roll it up, jelly-roll style, pulling the dough towards you to push out the air bubbles., Once you’ve completed all six rolls, then take each roll and roll it the other way. To do that, rotate it so it’s pointing away from you, then roll it up from the end nearest you to the end pointing away from you. This will essentially make it into a log shape again. Repeat this process 2 – 4 times, letting the rolls rest, covered, a couple minutes between each session. This builds tension in the dough and releases the air bubbles., Next, take a roll, and working from one end to the other, take your thumb on the side facing you and 2nd/3rd fingers on the side facing away from you. Grab onto the bottom edge with your 2nd/3rd fingers and gently pull the dough upwards and over, towards you and then use your thumb to pull the dough upward from the bottom to the top away from you. So you’re kind of pulling the dough from the bottom up and over and making the roll longer and thinner in the process. Move from left to right, repeating this action, until the roll is thin and looks like a fully-cooked puffy breadstick., Set the dough with the pinched side up on your oiled pan, then flip so the pinched side is down and the top is nicely oiled.

If using instant yeast, you can skip this step and add the yeast directly to the mix with the flour and salt., Next, add 2 Tablespoons of the olive oil to the mixing bowl and stir to mix. Then, add in the all-purpose flour and salt and mix together until no streaks of flour remain.

This extra-long rise is crucial for that yeasty & chewy focaccia flavor and texture., Second rise, Before removing the dough from the fridge grease a 9*13 inch pan with 1 Tablespoon of olive oil. This helps prevent any sticking and allows the focaccia to get a nice crust while baking. If your pan is not non-stick, you may want to add more olive oil or even a sheet of parchment paper before adding the dough., Next, remove the bowl of dough from the fridge. It should have risen substantially overnight. Lightly oil your hands to prevent sticking and then deflate the dough by pulling away the sides of the dough from the bowl and folding it into a loosely shaped ball., Add the deflated and folded dough to the 9*13 inch pan and gently pull it to stretch it out in the pan. It won't completely fill the pan at this point since the dough is cold, but rest assured it will after the next rise., Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let rise another 2-3 hours at room temperature until the dough has doubled in size and completely fills the pan., Baking the focaccia, Preheat the oven to 425F., Remove the plastic wrap from the pan and drizzle the final 1 Tablespoon of olive oil onto the dough. Lightly oil your hands again and then use all of your fingers to press into the dough and dimple it. Continue to do this until the dough is covered in little holes.

Set aside and let cool until temperature reaches about 120 to 130F, about 15 minutes. (I use Red Star Platinum Yeast which necessitates this temperature; allow mixture to cool to the ~100F range for other types of instant dry yeast, or to package directions). Stir in 1/4 cup tap water., To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook (or a large mixing bowl and knead by hand for about 10 minutes), combine flour, oil, brown sugar, instant dry yeast, and oatmeal mixture. Knead for 5 to 7 minutes on low speed, or until a moist, shaggy dough forms. The dough is quite moist and sticky, but resist the temptation to add additional flour, unless it’s so moist that it won’t combine. Conversely, if it’s too dry, add up to one-quarter cup water. Erring on the side of too moist is always preferable to too dry in bread-making., After kneading, turn the dough out into a large, greased bowl, cover with plasticwrap, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 2 hours, or until doubled in size. Create a warm environment by preheating your oven for 1 to 2 minutes to 400F, then shutting it off. This creates a 90F-ish warm spot. Slide the bowl in and wait while the yeast works. Just make sure your oven is off., Spray an 8-by-4-inch loaf pan with (coconut) cooking spray, or grease and flour the pan; set aside., After the dough has doubled, punch it down, turn it out onto a floured surface or Silpat and knead it for about 3 minutes., With your fingers or a rolling pin, shape dough into a 10-inch by 6-inch rectangle, just eyeball it. The long side should be slightly longer than the baking pan, which is 8 inches. Starting with a long edge, roll to form a tight cylinder. There’s not much to roll, about 3 turns. Tuck ends in and under, and place cylinder in prepared pan, seam side down. Optionally, when rolling, sprinkle with cinnamon, nutmeg, ground ginger, raisins, or diced dried fruit., Cover pan with plasticwrap, and allow dough to rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled, about 60 to 75 minutes. I use the oven trick to 400F for 1 minute trick again., In the last minutes of rising, preheat oven to 350F. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until lightly golden, domed, and puffy. Rotate pan midway through baking if desired. When tapped, bread should sound hollow. The internal temperature should reach 210F., Allow bread to cool in pan for 5 to 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. The cooling process is important and although it’s tempting, don’t slice into warm bread. I store bread by wrapping a fully cooled loaf in plasticwrap, and place it inside a gallon-size Ziplock, where it stays fresh for about 5 days. Bread freezes very well and can be made from start to finish, cooled, and placed in a freezer-safe airtight container or a ziplock for up to 3 months.

Gently pull the dough with the backs of your hands from the center out. At this point you can toss it or just continue pulling it gently until it's stretched to at least 12 inches in diameter. You can also gently grip the crust and let the dough hang and stretch from its own weight. Make sure to rotate the dough quickly while doing this so it stretches evenly. When making large pizzas I like to use a pizza pan for supporting the pizza, but smaller pizzas I like to cook on a pizza stone. When the dough is sufficiently stretched place it on the pizza pan and use a fork to perforate the dough from the center to crust. This will help keep your pizza from getting big air bubbles while baking., Using a wide spoon, add sauce to both pizzas. Then top the sauce with cheese and your favorite toppings. Pro Tip: If you are using spinach or another leafy green, add it to your pizza between the sauce and cheese layer. This will keep the spinach from burning and drying out!, Bake your pizzas staggered on separate racks in the middle of the oven for 25 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.","[('organic unbleached flour', 700.0, 'grams'), ('sourdough starter', 250.0, 'grams'), ('extra-virgin olive oil', 60.0, 'grams'), ('salt', 18.0, 'grams'), ('coconut sugar', 10.0, 'grams'), ('filtered water', 365.0, 'grams'), ('organic crushed tomatoes', 16.0, 'ounces'), ('garlic', None, None), ('dried oregano', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('water', 0.5, 'cup'), ('cheese', 1.0, 'pound'), ('salami', None, None), ('green olives', None, None), ('peppadew peppers', None, None), ('roasted garlic', None, None), ('ham', None, None), ('spinach', None, None), ('black olives', None, None)]"

109ea8bb,https://www.abeautifulplate.com/artisan-sourdough-bread-recipe/,Artisan Sourdough Bread Recipe,"350 grams unbleached bread flour (preferably organic, plus more for dusting), 90 grams whole wheat flour (preferably organic), 350 grams 90°F/32°C filtered water, 90 grams ripe sourdough starter (100% hydration), 9 grams Diamond Crystal kosher salt or fine sea salt, white rice flour (for dusting your banneton basket)","New to sourdough baking? I highly recommend reducing the hydration in this recipe if you are new to sourdough baking. This is a high hydration dough and can be challenging to work with (and build strength in) if you're not an experienced baker. If you're looking for an easier to handle dough, I recommend reducing the water to 310 to 330 grams total. If you're working with a lower hydration, you may be able to get away with just 3 to 4 sets of stretch and folds, or even less. Follow the dough's lead!, IMPORTANT NOTE: I do not prepare an off-shoot levain for my sourdough baking, as this baking timeline and method works well for my schedule, as well as my starter's feeding schedule. This choice is up to you and can be adapted/tweaked to fix your schedule, but please plan accordingly. Keep in mind that you'll need to account for the starter quantity in the recipe (90 grams), as well as the normal quantity needed to continue to maintain and feed your starter., Autolyse: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 350 grams unbleached bread flour and 90 grams whole wheat flour. Add 350 grams (90°F/32°C) filtered water and mix with your hands until thoroughly combined and no dry bits are visible. Cover with a clean shower cap or plastic wrap, and rest at 80°F/26°C for 1 hour or up to 2 hours. This step hydrates the flours and helps build dough structure., Add Starter and Rest: While this test isn't fool-proof, your sourdough starter should pass the 'float test' when it's ready. Place a tiny spoonful of your ripe starter in a jar of water, it should float to the top. If it sinks, give it more time (15 to 20 minutes) and test again. Add 90 grams ripe sourdough starter and spread it over the autolyse mixture. Use your fingertips to spread the starter over the autolyse mixture. Fold the edges of the dough into the center to fully incorporate the starter. Use your thumb and fingers to pinch the dough (pincer method) repeatedly until the starter is well incorporated. Don’t be delicate. You want to work quickly, but fully incorporate the mixture. Cover and rest at 80°F/26°C for 30 minutes., Add Salt and Rest: Sprinkle 9 grams salt over the surface of the dough. Use your thumb and fingers to pinch and incorporate the salt thoroughly (you shouldn't feel any granules at the end of mixing) into the dough. Depending on the coarseness of your salt, this might take a couple minutes. Be thorough. Cover and rest at 80°F/26°C for 15 minutes. Important Note and Tip: If you’re struggling with higher hydration doughs and dough strength, there are two additional mixing methods that you can try: slap and fold or the Rubaud method. Please see the full video included in this post for visual demonstration., Bulk Fermentation: We will preform a total of 6 sets of stretch and folds (see article above for further instruction) in the first two hours of bulk fermentation. The first three will take place in 15-minute intervals. The remaining three will occur in 30-minute intervals. Covering and rest the dough at 80°F/26°C between each set. The dough will not rise much during the stretch and fold period, but it should get considerably stronger. Dip your hands in water (to prevent sticking) before each fold. I like to rub my hands together to avoid incorporating much more water, as this is already a high hydration dough. How to Preform a Stretch and Fold: Grab the top portion of the dough with both hands. Gently pull and stretch it upwards (without tearing) and fold over the opposite edge. Rotate the bowl 180 degrees and repeat from the other side. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat once again on both sides. This entire process is one stretch and fold set. After performing the stretch and folds, I like to gently lift the dough to round it nicely in the bowl (see video). *If your dough is developing quickly, you can reduce the total number of stretch and folds to 3 or 4 sets, 30 minutes apart., Bulk Fermentation (continued): Allow the dough to rest, covered at 80°F/26°C, for an additional 1.5 - 2 hours after the last stretch and fold - watch it carefully. Generally, I like to end bulk fermentation when the dough is just under double in size. This has produced good results for me and this guideline works well for this specific sourdough process and timeline. The total bulk fermentation time will vary tremendously based on your ambient kitchen temperature, dough temperature (FDT), flour type, and several other factors, so watch it carefully. Judging the right point to end bulk fermentation and move to the pre-shape period requires practice and trial-and-error. At the end of bulk fermentation, the dough should be well aerated and there will be many gas bubbles on surface, as well as on the edges of the bowl (see video). The dough should be slightly rounded on the edges of the bowl. If the dough is flat, you most likely didn’t build enough strength during mixing, stretch and folds, or bulk., Pre-Shape: Transfer the dough, without degassing, onto a clean countertop. It will be sticky. Use a bench knife to gently shape the dough into a round, pulling it gently towards you on the countertop in a circle to create some tension on the skin of the dough. As you do this, you’ll notice that the dough comes into a shape and starts to feel bouncy (see video). The key is to do this as quickly and gently as possible. Rest the dough, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it has relaxed slightly for the final shaping. Pre-shaping gives the dough some extra tension and strength (and is particularly important if you are doubling the recipe and preparing two loaves, as you'll need to divide it prior). Allowing it to rest allows the gluten to relax slightly before preforming the final shape., Final Shape: Dust a 9-inch round or 10 or 11-inch oval banneton basket with rice flour (be extra liberal if you are not using a cloth or linen liner). Dust the surface of the dough lightly with bread flour. Use a bench knife to gently lift and flip it flour side down onto your countertop. Depending on your preference, banneton, or baking vessel, shape the dough into a round or batard. *Tip: Please watch the video above for visuals on how to shape a batard (oval loaf) or my latest video on how to shape rounds (boules) and bake in a Dutch oven. After shaping, gently pick up the shaped dough, flip, and transfer into your floured banneton, with the seam side facing up. Drape a kitchen linen over the banneton and place the banneton in a plastic bag (*I use a clean plastic produce bag). Seal with a clip and allow the dough to rest at room temperature for 10 minutes., Final Proof: Place covered banneton basket in the refrigerator and retard dough for 15-16 hours at 38°F/3°C. This slow and cold fermentation stage helps develop flavor and improves the final crust texture., Preheat the Oven: Preheat your Challenger Pan, Dutch Oven, or combo cooker (with lid on) in a 500°F/260°C oven for at least 1 hour., Poke Test for Proofing: Once the oven and baking vessel have preheated for an hour, remove the banneton from the fridge and uncover. Test the dough for proper proofing by lightly flouring one small section (while the dough is still in the banneton). Press your finger lightly into the dough. A properly proofed dough should very SLOWLY spring back and still leave a light indentation. That is a sign of a well proofed dough that is ready to be baked. If it springs back quickly and completely, it is under-proofed (return to the fridge, covered, for an additional hour or so). If the dough compresses and doesn’t spring back at all, it is over-proofed. Unfortunately at that point, it’s hard to make up for in that stage of the process - but it will still taste delicious!, Transfer and Bake: If you are using a Challenger Pan or combo cooker, you can skip parchment and carefully invert the basket directly into the preheated base before scoring. If you are using a traditional Dutch oven, please watch this video for visuals: Place a large piece of parchment over the banneton, then top with a thin cutting board. Invert and flip carefully, so that the banneton is upside down, setting it down onto your countertop. The dough should release, right side up, from the banneton onto the parchment. Trim any excess parchment paper, creating two handles on both ends for lifting the dough. Use a bread lame to score the dough (1/2-inch deep), carefully transfer into the preheated pan, cover tightly with the lid, and place in the oven. Bake covered at 500°F/260°C for 25 minutes., Remove the lid. The dough should have risen and expanded considerably, and the crust should be set, but only lightly golden in color., Reduce the oven temperature to 475°F/240°C (*note: if your oven runs hot or your loaves are browning too quickly, reduce the temperature to 450°F/232°C) and continue to bake uncovered for an additional 15-25 minutes or longer until the crust is deep golden and caramelized. I like to rotate the pan several times during this final stage to ensure even browning., Carefully remove the bread from the pan and transfer to a cooling rack. Cool completely before slicing. This will take several hours. Slicing into warm bread will result in a gummier texture and cause the bread to stale faster.

Take the entire ball of dough and invert it into a clean, lightly greased bowl, so the seam is down and the top is smooth. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, 5- 6 hours., Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and cut in half. Working with one piece of dough at a time, shape into a ball as follows. Stretch out a quarter of the dough just until you feel resistance, then fold it back over the center. Repeat stretching and folding the remaining three edges until the center is covered and a loose ball is formed. Turn the ball over so the seam is down and place it on an un-floured area. Cup your hands around the dough and gently pull it towards you, dragging the bottom along the counter to create a bit of tension.

Add the flour and salt. Mix to combine, finishing by hand if necessary to form a rough dough. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes., Stretch and fold, After 30 minutes, grab a corner of the dough and pull it up and into the center. Repeat until you’ve performed this series of folds 4 to 5 times with the dough. Let dough rest for another 30 minutes and repeat the stretching and folding action. If you have the time: do this twice more for a total of 4 times in 2 hours. Note: Even if you can only perform one series of stretches and folds, your dough will benefit. So don’t worry if you have to run off shortly after you mix the dough., Bulk Fermentation (first rise), Cover the bowl with a towel and let rise at room temperature, about 8 to 10 hours at 70°F (21°C) or even less if you live in a warm environment. The dough is ready when it has increased by 50% in volume, has a few bubbles on the surface, and jiggles when you move the bowl from side to side. (UPDATE: In the past I have recommended letting the dough rise until it doubles in volume. If you’ve had success with this, continue to let the dough double. Recently, I have been stopping the bulk fermentation when the dough increases by 50% in volume, and I feel I am actually getting better oven spring in the end.) (Note regarding timing: If you are using 100 g of starter, the bulk fermentation may take less than 8 to 10 hours. If you live in a warm, humid environment, the bulk fermentation may take even less time. In the late spring/early summer, for example, my kitchen is 78ºF and the bulk fermentation takes 6 hours. It is best to rely on visual cues (increase in volume by roughly 50%) as opposed to time to determine when the bulk fermentation is done. A straight-sided vessel makes monitoring the bulk fermentation especially easy because it allows you to see when your dough has truly increased in volume by 50%.), Shape (See notes above), Coax the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Gently shape it into a round: fold the top down to the center, turn the dough, fold the top down to the center, turn the dough; repeat until you’ve come full circle. If you have a bench scraper, use it to push and pull the dough to create tension., Rest, Let the dough rest seam side up rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, line an 8-inch (20-cm) bowl or proofing basket with a towel (flour sack towels are ideal) and dust with flour (preferably rice flour, which doesn’t burn the way all-purpose flour does). Using a bench scraper or your hands, shape it again as described in step 4. Place the round into your lined bowl, seam side up., Proof (second rise), Cover the dough and refrigerate for 1 hour or for as long as 48 hours. (Note: I prefer to let this dough proof for at least 24 hours prior to baking. See video for the difference in the crumb of a loaf that has proofed for 6 hours vs one that has proofed for 24 hours. If you choose to proof the dough in the fridge for an extended period of time, you may want to tuck it into a loosely tied bag — produce bags from the grocery store are great for this purpose — to ensure the dough does not dry out. The original recipe calls for a 1-hour rise, and if you have had success doing that, by all means, keep doing it.), Place a Dutch oven in your oven, and preheat your oven to 550°F (290°C). Cut a piece of parchment to fit the size of your baking pot., Score, Place the parchment over the dough and invert the bowl to release. Using the tip of a small knife or a razor blade, score the dough however you wish — a simple “X” is nice. Use the parchment to carefully transfer the dough into the preheated baking pot., Bake, Lower the oven to temperature to 450ºF (230ºC). Carefully cover the pot. Bake the dough for 30 minutes, covered. Remove the lid, lower the temperature to 400ºF (200ºC) and continue to bake for 10 – 15 minutes more. If necessary, lift the loaf out of the pot, and bake directly on the oven rack for the last 5 to 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour before slicing., This loaf will stay fresh up to 3 days stored at room temperature in an airtight plastic bag or container.

If using your hands sprinkle a little of the extra flour onto your clean work surface and turn out the dough. Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to your hands or the work surface, but try to be sparing. It's better to use too little flour than too much.

Remove from the heat., Allow the milk mixture to cool to the temperature of a warm bath (not hot!), and stir in the yeast. Allow the mixture to sit for 5 minutes to make sure the yeast is active and alive. You should see bubbles on the surface (don't be alarmed if it's not super foamy), and the mixture should grow in volume., When you are certain the yeast is working, in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, add the milk mixture.

This may be difficult and you may need to kind of bounce the dough to get it to stretch. Place dough that is in your hands back into the center. Turn the bowl about a quarter turn and complete another stretch and fold. Repeat two more times. This is considered one round., Thirty minutes later, complete another round of stretch and folds. Cover and allow the dough to rest another 30 minutes., Complete one last stretch and fold round., Cover with a lid, damp towel, or plastic wrap. Let the dough bulk ferment in a warm place until it has doubled in size. This could be anywhere from 6-12 hours (or longer) depending on the temperature of your kitchen, maturity of your starter, etc. Be careful not to let it over ferment., Shape, Place the dough on a clean work surface that has been lightly dusted with flour. Fold the dough onto itself and roll up. Then shape into a ball by gently spinning it toward you., Optional - Let the dough sit out for 15-20 minutes uncovered. This prevents the dough from sticking to the tea towel during the overnight rise., Turn over and shape. I do this by folding the two sides over to meet in the middle, pinch together and then repeat on the other two sides. This creates surface tension which helps give it more oven spring (a good rise)., Transfer to a floured banneton or bowl with a floured tea towel (typically floured with rice flour, this is not necessary and all-purpose will work just fine) seam side up., Cover with plastic or place in a plastic bag and tie the ends. Let the dough rest for 12-15 hours in the refrigerator. You can also let the bread rise at room temperature for 3-4 hours. I like using the longer rise time in the refrigerator because it is easier to score and feel like the oven spring is better., Bake, Preheat a dutch oven to 500 degrees for 1 hour., Remove dough from the fridge right before baking. Place dough on a piece of parchment paper., Dust with flour, if desired, and score with lame or razor blade.

Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water and give it a quick stir, then let the mixture rest for 5-10 minutes until the yeast is foamy., Mix the dough, Add the flour, yogurt, salt, baking powder, and egg. Using the dough attachment, mix the dough on medium-low speed for 2-3 minutes until smooth. (The dough will still be slightly sticky, but should form into a ball that pulls away from the sides of the mixing bowl. If it’s too sticky, add a bit more flour.), Let the dough rise, Remove dough from the mixing bowl and use your hands to shape it into a ball. Grease the mixing bowl (or a separate bowl) lightly with cooking spray, then place the dough ball back in the bowl and cover it with a damp towel. Place the bowl in a warm location (I set mine by a sunny window) and let it rise for 1 hour until the dough has nearly doubled in size., (Optional) Make the garlic butter, During the last 10 minutes of the dough’s rise time, heat the butter in a small sauté pan over medium heat until melted. Add the garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Remove the pan from heat and stir in some chopped herbs, if desired. (You can also strain out the garlic chunks if you prefer the garlic butter to be completely smooth.), Roll out the dough, Once the dough is ready to go, transfer it to a floured work surface and shape it into an even(ish) circle. Cut the dough into 8 equally-sized wedges and roll each wedge into a ball with your hands. Then use a rolling pin to roll out the dough ball until it forms an oval about 1/4-inch thick. (I recommend multi-tasking this process — rolling out the next dough ball while you cook one on the stove.), Cook the dough, Heat a large cast-iron skillet or non-stick sauté pan over medium-high heat until it is nice and hot. Add a piece of the rolled-out dough to the pan and cook for 1 minute, or until the top of the dough begins to bubble and the bottom turns lightly golden. Flip the dough and cook on the second side for 30-60 seconds, or until the bottom is golden as well, then transfer the dough to a clean plate. (If you are making garlic naan, brush one or both side(s) of the dough with the garlic butter once the naan has cooked.) Sprinkle the naan with a pinch of flaky sea salt, if desired. Then lightly cover the naan with a clean towel so that it stays warm.

After the bulk fermentation, the gluten will break down so do not worry about this., Put the dough back into the bowl after kneading the salt in cover with plastic wrap and a dish towel and allow to rise in a warm place until dough doubles in size. Mine took another 3 hours., Once the dough has doubled in size, remove the dough from the bowl and onto a floured surface. Cut the dough equally into 2 pieces. Each piece will make 1 loaf. The dough will deflate in this process so no need to punch down., Form the dough into a tight round circle by patting the dough into a rough circle and then folding the edges into the center and tightly forming a ball.

Form into a rough ball, cover the bowl with food wrap or a shower cap, and leave for 10 minutes., Pour a little oil onto the kitchen counter and spread it with your hand to give a light sheen to an area big enough to knead on. Take the dough out of its bowl and duly knead it for 10 seconds. How you knead is very personal: we all have our different styles; I push the dough away with the heel of my hand and bring it back with my fingers. Form the dough back into a ball, return it to its bowl, cover it again, and leave for 10 minutes. Repeat this process twice, and after the third 10-second knead, form the dough into a ball again, put it back in the bowl, cover, and leave for an hour., Line the bottom of a 2lb/900g loaf tin and very lightly grease the sides; I use an old butter wrapper for this. Take the plumptiously risen dough out of its bowl, and pat it out on your oiled surface so that you have a soft, puffy mattress about 2cm thick, with one edge about 4cm shorter than the length of your tin. Starting with this edge, and using both hands, tightly roll the dough into a scroll — or swiss roll, if that helps you visualise it better — and tenderly place it seam side down in your prepared tin; you may have to press the short sides gently to fit it in, as the scroll can get longer as you roll. Leave to rise for 1–1½ hours, until it’s peeking out just above the top of the tin. Turn the oven on when it looks like it’s nearly there., So, heat the oven to 200℃/180℃ Fan/400°F. Dust the top of the dough with flour and bake for 45 minutes, by which time the bread will be risen, with a rounded and deep biscuity-gold top. Unless your oven is misfiring, it will definitely be done. Armed with oven gloves, quickly take the bread out of the tin, and place it on a wire rack to cool before slicing into it.

Mix in by pinching and squishing the dough with your fingers, then stretch it up and fold it over on itself until it starts to come together.

Keep working your way around the bowl., Once you have finished mixing, transfer the dough into a lightly oiled bowl or plastic container, ideally with see-through sides. Cover with a lid or tea towel., Proof the dough for two hours, with a set of stretch and folds every 30 minutes (so a total of four sets of stretch and folds). To stretch and fold, you repeat the same motion as in the mixing phase - reach under, stretch the dough up and over itself, then turn the container 90° and repeat again until you have done four stretch and folds. Then cover the dough and leave to sit for 30 minutes until you repeat the next set of stretch and folds., Once you have finished the stretch and fold process, cover the bowl either with a lid or plastic wrap, and place into the fridge overnight, or for up to 24 hours., When you are ready to bake the ciabatta, line a baking pan with baking paper and lightly flour the paper.

Check back in 10 minutes to make sure it has bubbled and foamed up. If it has then add lukewarm water up to the 2 cup mark of the measuring cup. Note: If it didn’t then you need to try another packet / jar of yeast., In a bowl blend the flour and salt, mix well. Next pour the water 1/2 cup at a time into the flour mix using your fork to blend. Continue to add as much of the water/yeast mixture that you need. Please note you may not need all of the water.

Place on the counter to dry or toast briefly in the toaster. You can also stick the bread in the oven for about 20 minutes or so while the tomatoes are roasting.

Add the saffron to a small bowl or cup and add a tablespoon of boiling water. Set aside to soak., In the meantime, make the starter. In a medium-sized pan, combine the milk, butter, honey and sugar. Gently heat over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved and the butter has melted. Take the pan off the heat and leave to cool until the milk mixture is warm and no longer hot. Yeast doesn’t do hot, so a good way to test whether the milk is cool enough, is just dipping your finger in it. If you find it pleasantly warm, yeast will like it too., Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the milk mixture and let it ‘bloom’ (aka: get soggy and wet and a little bubbly). Add the saffron mixture and stir briefly to combine, then add the flour and stir together with a fork, cover with plastic wrap and leave to rise in a warm place for about 1-1,5 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size., Finish the dough. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and half the salt. Add it to the dough in the pan and knead with your hands to incorporate the dry ingredients into the dough. Place the dough in a medium-sized bowl., Beat the egg yolk with the remaining salt and add it to the dough. Knead to incorporate. The dough will be quite sticky. Dust your countertop with flour, plop the dough on top of it, dust the dough with a little more flour and knead until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky. It’s okay to dust the dough and countertop with flour every now and then, but don’t add too much flour, as this will affect the texture of the bread. I lightly dusted with flour four times. After about 5 minutes of kneading (and the 4 dustings of flour) the dough shouldn’t be sticky anymore., Butter a 20-cm or 8-inch round cake pan with butter and divide the dough into 7 equal chunks. Roll each chunk into a ball and arrange them in the baking pan, one dough ball in the middle, the other six in a circle around it (but place the middle ball in last). The dough balls should be touching each other. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and leave to rise until doubled in size, about 1½ hour. Every half hour or so, check on the dough to make sure it doesn’t touch the plastic wrap. I usually take the plastic wrap off as soon as the dough has risen high enough to just touch it to allow the dough to rise over the top of the pan., While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 180°C/360°F (standard oven setting). Once the dough has doubled in size, place the pan on an oven rack and place the rack one ridge under the middle of the oven. Bake for 30 minutes. After 15-20 minutes, loosely place a piece of aluminum foil on top of the bread to prevent the top from browning too much., Once the bread is done, make the glaze.

This is an essential step for this recipe. Steep the tea for 5 minutes (or according to package directions). While the tea is steeping, add both kinds of raisins to a medium mixing bowl, along with the zest of the lemon and orange. Once the tea has steeped, remove the tea bags and add the still hot tea to the bowl. Toss everything together. Once the tea has cooled stir in the whiskey (if using). Cover the bowl and allow it to sit at room temperature for at least 8 hours (or overnight)., Prepare, When you are ready to bake the bread, brew some more strong breakfast tea. Allow it to cool completely (I sometimes pop mine in the freezer to help seep things along). Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease a 9 inch bread pan, and line the bottom of it with parchment paper. Note: if things tend to stick easily in your bread pan then I suggest using extra parchment paper to allow for overhang, to create “handles” to easily lift out the bread once it’s baked., Mix the dry ingredients, In a large mixing bowl combine the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger. Create a well in the dry ingredients., Add the wet ingredients, Add the brown sugar, whisked egg, and vanilla. Add half of the soaked fruit, along with any of it’s liquid to the dry ingredients.

NOTE: The batter should be thick, and very wet. It should be pourable, but not runny. Depending on how much of the tea the raisins initially soak up depends on how much of the freshly brewed tea you will need to add. Start with 1/4 cup and gradually add 1 tablespoon of tea until the consistency is just right. Keep in mind that if the batter is too runny the loaf will take up to 90 minutes to bake, and it still may have a slightly under baked center., Bake, Transfer the batter to the prepared pan.

If you prefer a softer crust (like a traditional bread) mix the butter into the batter instead of pouring it over the top., Sifting flour for bread recipes is a must-do. Most people just scoop the 1 cup measure in the flour canister and level it off. That compacts the flour and will turn your bread into a ""hard biscuit"" as some have described.

Add 175g of the water, mix well, then cover the bowl. The fruit and nuts should be covered by the water. Leave overnight or for at least 4 hours., Once soaked, strain the fruit and nut mix and set aside. Make sure to keep the strained water for the dough. It'll add extra flavour to the bread., Combine the flours, yeast, salt and water (use the strained date and walnut water and add additional water to make up 370g in total) in a bowl. The dough should be quite firm at this stage, although it will be slightly sticky due to the rye content., Turn the dough out to your working surface and knead for 10 minutes. Use a dough cutter or two to handle the dough., Shape the dough into a ball, place it back into the bowl, cover and rest for 30 minutes. The dough will visibly expand during that time., After this 30 minute rest, carefully work the moist date and walnut mix into the dough. This isn't the easiest task but combine it all until the dates and walnuts are evenly distributed. More moisture is being added to the dough here from the soaked fruit and nuts, so it's a very squidgy task., Once incorporated, shape the dough into a ball, place it back into the bowl, cover and rest for 1 hour or more until the dough has grown significantly in size., Turn out the dough onto a floured surface., Use your dough cutter to divide the dough into two even parts., With floury hands, shape each part into a neat round loaf. Try to cover the outside of the dough with a thin layer of flour to help with the shaping but try not to fold any additional flour into the dough itself. It'll become much easier to handle once you flour the outside., Place the date and walnut loaves on a baking tray covered with baking paper. I usually try to fit both loaves onto one sheet of baking paper. Leave enough space between the loaves and the baking tray edges to allow for expansion., Cover with a clean kitchen towel and prove for 1 hour or more. The loaves will almost double in size during this final proof., Preheat the oven to 220°C approximately 1/2 hour before baking., Score the loaves at the top, a simple cross pattern works well., Bake at 220°C for 10 minutes, then turn the temperature down to 200°C for a further 25 - 30 minutes until the loaf has fully baked through (I use my Thermapen to ensure the loaf is at least 95°C in the centre)., Cool on a wire rack.","[('flour', 300.0, 'g'), ('flour', 200.0, 'g'), ('yeast', 7.0, 'g'), ('salt', 8.0, 'g'), ('water', 370.0, 'g'), ('walnuts', 50.0, 'g'), ('dates', 125.0, 'g')]"

Make sure you have enough starter leftover to feed and store for future use., Day 1 (morning; Mix the dough): Stir in the unfed starter and water in a bowl. Once the starter has been evenly distributed in the water add the bread flour and cacao powder (if using). Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let sit for one hour., Day 1 (morning): Add the soaked and drained raisins and kosher salt to the mixture in the bowl. Combine the dough using a wet hand and folding the dough over from the bottom to top. Then Ken Forkish employs what he calls the “pincer” method to make sure all the ingredients are fully incorporated. Imagining your hand as a lobster claw (my description), cut through the dough pinching a few times, mixing, then pinching again., Day 1 (morning; stretch-and-fold). Pick up one portion of the dough (without taking it out of the bowl) and fold it over. Repeat this folding step a few times, inverting the dough with the folds at the bottom of the bowl when done. This stretch-and-fold step should be done every thirty minutes, three or four times over the course of two hours. After the final stretch-and-fold, cover the bowl with a towel or plastic wrap to for bulk fermentation., Day 1 (evening; testing for completion of Bulk Fermentation): Depending on the temperature of your kitchen your dough should have doubled in size eight afters after stretch-and-fold. A warmer kitchen would take less time and a cooler one, more time. You should see bubbles throughout the dough if you're using a clear container and if you pull the dough a little it should be webby underneath., Day 1 (evening; shape and overnight proof): Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. The dough will relax and flatten when you take it out of the bowl. Taking one section of dough at at time, fold the sections over the rest of the dough until you have a somewhat tight ball shape. Then tighten the dough by pulling it towards you by cupping the dough with both your hands using your pinky fingers as the anchors. Tension is created on the surface of the dough as you pull it towards you. Rotate then repeat three to four times until the dough holds its ball shape. Transfer the dough on a floured banneton with the seam side down. Cover the entire proofing basket with a plastic bag and store in the refrigerator overnight. For my loaf, my dough proofed in the fridge for nineteen hours. It should be fine to bake the next morning. To test for readiness, poke the dough with a floured finger, making about a 1/2-inch indentation. If the dent springs back immediately, the dough needs a longer proofing. If the dent springs back slowly and doesn’t completely disappear, the dough is ready to bake., Day 2 (bake): This recipe uses a dutch oven for baking. Preheat your oven to 475ºF with a rack in the center of the oven. Put the dutch oven with the lid on the rack while the oven preheats. Once the oven has reached temperature, take the dough out of the refrigerator and invert it onto a piece of parchment paper, leaving enough paper on either side to be able to lift it. Make sure you have oven mitts then take the (very hot) dutch oven out of the oven and place on the counter or stove. Remove the lid and rest one of your mitts on top of the lid so you don’t touch it by accident. Take the ends of the parchment paper and carefully lift and transfer the dough to the dutch oven. Cover the dutch oven and place it back in the oven. Bake covered for 30 minutes then uncover and bake for another 20-25 minutes, checking your bread at the 15-18 minute mark just in case your oven runs hot. When done, tilt the bread out of the dutch oven and let it cool on a rack for at least 20 minutes before slicing.","[('starter', 85.0, 'grams'), ('bread flour', 460.0, 'grams'), ('water', 367.0, 'grams'), ('cacao powder', 10.0, 'grams'), ('salt', 5.0, 'grams'), ('raisins', 55.0, 'grams')]"

Mix them together briefly. Then add your dark rye flour, bread flour, dark malt powder and salt and mix altogether with the end of a wooden spoon.The dough will be fairly shaggy and only just brought together. Cover your bowl with cling film or a damp tea towel and let it sit for around 1 hour. It's ok if it's a little bit longer, it's not going to matter too much.This process is called the ""autolyse"" and allows your flour to soak in all the water and become hydrated., Forming Up Your Dough:After the dough has been through autolyse you need to bring it together into a ball. You'll notice that the dough is fully hydrated after soaking all the water up. Work your way around the bowl, grabbing the dough from the outside, stretching it up and over itself until a rough ball is formed. You shouldn't need more than about 20-25 folds to form the ball (and remember that rye flour will make the dough stickier than you're used to).Once the dough has formed into a rough ball, pop the plastic wrap back on and let it rest for 30 minutes., Stretch & Folds:Over the next few hours you need to create some structure for your dough by ""stretching and folding"". This will be much more difficult to do with dark rye flour than with traditional sourdough bread.Aim to do around 4-6 sets of stretches and folds. For each set, stretch the dough up and over itself 4 times. Leave around 15 minutes in between each set. Again you do not have to be exact with time, but you need to do at least 4 sets over 2 hours.You will need to really work the dough to develop the gluten - because rye flour has a lower gluten content. Don't worry though, if the dough seems to tear and stick to your fingers - this is very normal!!, Bulk Ferment:Once you've finished your stretch and folds, place the plastic wrap or damp towel back over your dough and let it rest and ferment at room temperature until it has doubled (see notes)., Shaping Your Dough:Once your dough has finished it's first ferment, it's time to shape it and give it some shape and surface tension. You'll need to flour your counter top with rice flour for this (we use rice flour because it has no gluten). You'll probably need more rice flour for this sourdough pumpernickel bread than you would for regular sourdough bread.Use a silicone dough scraper to gently ease the dough out of the bowl. You want it to land upside down on your counter so that the smooth top of the dough is on the countertop and the sticky underside is facing up. This will make it easier to shape.You can shape into whatever you like. I prefer this one as a batard. It also works well baked in a loaf pan if you are really struggling with shaping., Once the dough is shaped, place it into your banneton smooth side down, so your seam is on the top. Use a bench scraper to do this if you need to.Lift your dough around the edges to pop a little more rice flour if you feel it needs it., Cold Ferment:Now your dough is in it's ""shaping container"" cover it loosely with a plastic bag or damp tea towel and place into the fridge. I use a large plastic bag to cover it - I just reuse it each time. It's not totally essential to cover it - you can place it in the fridge uncovered if you'd prefer.Try to leave it in the fridge for a minimum 5 hours up to a maximum of around 36 hours. The longer you leave it the better your bread will be! A longer cold ferment creates beautiful blisters on your crust and a deeper sourdough flavour. It will also ensure your dough forms a skin which makes it easier to score., Preparing to Bake Your Sourdough:Once you're ready to bake your sourdough, you'll need to preheat your oven to 230C/450F. Place your Dutch Oven into the oven when you turn it on so it gets hot. Try to preheat for around 1 hour to ensure your oven is super hot - but you know your oven so just adjust this time if you need to.Leave your dough in the fridge until the very last minute - placing a cold dough into a hot oven will give you a great ""spring""., Baking Your Sourdough:When your oven is at temperature. Take your sourdough out of the fridge. Gently place it onto a piece of baking paper. Make sure that you make the baking paper big enough to use the edges as a handle to lower to dough into your Dutch Oven.Gently score your bread with a lame, clean razor blade or knife. Carefully take your dutch oven out of the oven. Place the sourdough into the pot using the baking paper as a handle. Put the lid on and place into the hot oven. If you want to you can spritz your dough with extra water before you put the lid on.BAKE TIME:30 Minutes with the lid on at 230C/450F plus10-15 Minutes with the lid off at 210C/410F, Finishing Your Bake:When you remove your dough from the oven, carefully remove it from the dutch oven as soon as possible and place on a wire rack to cool. You'll need to allow this bread a bit longer to cool due to its higher moisture content. It will take up to 12 hours for it to cool completely (this is normal for sourdough rye bread).","[('sourdough starter', 100.0, 'g'), ('bread flour', 250.0, 'g'), ('dark rye flour', 200.0, 'g'), ('water', 350.0, 'g'), ('molasses', 25.0, 'g'), ('dark malt powder', 10.0, 'g'), ('salt', 10.0, 'g')]"

Set aside for step 6., Make the cookie dough, Whisk the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside., In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on medium speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg, molasses, and water on high speed. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. On low speed, slowly mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until combined. Cookie dough will be very thick., Divide cookie dough in half, flatten into discs (about 4-5 inches in diameter), and wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours or up to 3 days., Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats., Cut into shapes, Remove each disc from the refrigerator and roll each out in between two pieces of parchment paper. Watch me do this in the video above—gingerbread cookie dough will stick to your counter no matter how much you flour it. Parchment is best. Roll out to about 1/4 inch thick. You want thick pieces for your gingerbread house. Lightly flour the underside of gingerbread house template shapes. (The dough is sticky and the paper may stick to it otherwise.) Using a pizza cutter or small knife, carefully cut the dough into the gingerbread house template shapes. You will need TWO of each shape. Re-roll dough scraps so you have enough dough for the whole house. Use any extra dough to create fun shapes using cookie cutters. I made a few gingerbread stars!, Carefully arrange gingerbread house shapes onto prepared baking sheets, about 3 inches apart. If they lost some of their shape transferring to the baking sheet, straighten out the edges (see my video above)., Bake house pieces for about 18-20 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Bake chimney pieces for about 12-13 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Remove from the oven and allow shapes to cool completely on the baking sheets or on the counter. A flat surface is KEY for cooling—the gingerbread house edges very slightly curl up otherwise. Cooled gingerbread house pieces can be made up to 1 week in advance, cover tightly and store at room temperature or in the refrigerator. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months, thaw at room temperature before using., Construct the base of the house, Select a base for your gingerbread house. I used a wooden cake server. Watch my video above to guide you through constructing the house. Start with two pieces: the front of the house and 1 side. Using a squeeze bottle, run a thick line of royal icing on one long edge and one short edge of the side of the house piece. Stick it to your base. Use whatever you have around the house to help it stand up. You can see in my video that I use snack bag clips. You can also prop it up with soda cans, a tall cup, water bottle, etc. Run a line of royal icing along the bottom of the front of the house piece. Stick it to your base, adhering it to the side of the house piece. Hold the two in place for a few minutes until the icing is partially set, propping them up as necessary. Repeat with the 2nd side of the house piece and back of the house piece. Pipe royal icing inside any seams, inside and outside of the house, to fill any voids. Don’t be afraid to go heavy on the royal icing “glue”—when it dries, it looks like snow! Allow it to set at room temperature for at least 1 hour before adding the roof pieces., Add the roof, The roof pieces will be placed on top of the house base. Run a thick line of royal icing on the inside edges of one of the roof pieces and adhere it to the base. Hold in place for a few minutes. Repeat with 2nd roof piece. Run a thick line of royal icing where the two roof pieces meet at the top of the house. Hold in place for a few minutes., Optional Chimney, The chimney is optional, but it’s a lot of fun. I recommend putting together the chimney separately, then adhering to the roof. It’s easiest to glue the chimney pieces together upside-down. Use thick lines of royal icing to assemble the chimney in the same way you put together the base of the house. (Except you’re not adhering it to a base because it’s going on the roof!) Allow icing to set by propping it up as necessary. Once set, adhere onto the roof. The chimney may not fit to the exact angle of the roof because both puffed up or lost some shape during baking and cooling, so use as much royal icing as necessary and you can cover any bare spots with buttercream during decoration., House must set, Before decorating, the icing on the entire house must completely set. Allow the entire house to set at room temperature for at least 3 hours, preferably 4-6 hours or even overnight before decorating. Cover and store leftover royal icing at room temperature or in the refrigerator during this time. It will be the glue for adhering candies to the house., Prepare the buttercream:, Buttercream can be prepared up to 1 day in advance—cover tightly and store in the refrigerator overnight. Bring to room temperature before piping/decorating. With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the shortening and butter together on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, milk, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 full minutes. Frosting will be very thick, which is what you want. If much too thick, add another splash of milk. Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. (I add 1/8 teaspoon salt.), Use buttercream, leftover royal icing, and candies for decorating. See my candy suggestions in the blog post above. I only used 1 piping tip for the entire house: Ateco piping tip #32. This is a small open star piping tip and you can watch me use it in the video above. Makes a lovely design., Don’t forget to chow down on your beautiful creation if you’re in the mood for eating it.

Mix gently with your fingertips to dissolve slightly., mix, Add the portioned bread flour and whole wheat flour to your starter/water bowl as well. Using your hands and a dough scraper, bring the mixture together until the flour is fully incorporated, and you have a nice basic dough. Scrape any remaining dough from your hands and the sides of the bowl into the bowl itself., rest, Let rest, covered with a tea towel, for 30-40 minutes. This is the first resting period where the proteins and starches in the flour will have time to absorb all of the water for a pliable dough., fold, After resting, uncover, add the salt, and the remaining 50 grams of warm spring water to the dough. Gently fold the dough over itself to mix the water in. You can also squeeze the dough through your fingers. It may break apart as you do this, but don't worry - just keep mixing!, mix, Once the water is fully mixed into the dough, gently fold the sides of the dough onto itself three or four times, to introduce some air into the mix., rest, Gently transfer the dough into a lager bowl (or what I like to use, a medium-sized, clear, Rubbermaid container). Cover once more with a tea towel, and place on a warm countertop in the kitchen. This is the beginning of the 'bulk fermentation' stage., bulk, Let the dough bulk for 30 minutes., chop, During this first period, chop your dried fruit, and soak for 20 minutes in (room-temperature) strong black tea in a medium sized bowl. Then, drain the fruit by dumping it into a fine mesh sieve over a bowl. Measure out your silvered almonds, and reserve both the fruit and nuts. Discard the tea., drain, After the 30 minutes are up, add the drained dried fruit mix and nuts to the dough. Grabbing one side of the dough, pull it up, and fold to the other side, allowing some air to be folding in. Repeat three to four times, folding both the dough and the fruit mix. Cover once again, and let rest 30 Minutes., fold, Repeat the folding process for a total of SIX (6) 30 minute periods, or about three hours of bulk fermentation/rise. The dough should be pillowy and soft by the end. The sides should pull easily away from the container and there should be a 20-30% increase in volume. If you think you need a bit more time, allow 1-2 more 30 minute rests and folds., shape, Next, we will shape and rest (the dough). Using a dough scraper, scrape the dough onto an unfloured work space. Lightly flour the surface of the dough, then, using the bench scraper, divide into two roughly equal pieces., fold, Flip each portion of dough over, so the floured side is now resting on the counter or board. Then, gently (but firmly), fold the edges of the dough onto itself, so the floured side is the outer surface of the dough ball. *see photo*. This side will be the outer crust of each loaf., round, Lightly flour your hands and, with hands on each side of the round (you can use a bench scraper in one hand if you prefer), gently move the round to you, while pushing the opposite hand under the dough slightly, and rotating. You want to use your hands to shape the dough into a circle with a tight 'skin"" on top. I find about 4 or 5 turns around do the trick. Tension is key to a sturdy crust., round, Repeat with the second portion of dough., rest, (If the surface of the dough rips during the rounding, let the dough relax for ten minutes and start again.), bench rest, Let both rounds rest on the counter or board and cover with a towel to prevent drafts. Let the bread dough bench rest for another 30 minutes., rest, While the rounds are bench resting, the dough will relax and spread sightly. The edges will appear rounded, but should not look like they are dripping off the board. If it looks like it's spreading too much, the bulk ferment has not yet been for long enough. No worries though, simply round the dough again, and let rest again for 30 more minutes., rest, If all looks good, we will now go to the final shaping and the overnight rest:, stretch, Lightly flour the tops of each loaf and, using the scraper, flip the whole thing over so that the board side is now facing up, and the floured surface is facing down., stretch, Grabbing the edge closest to you (on the bottom of the board), firmly stretch & fold over to the upper edge (top of the board side) and press the edge down. Next, grab the right edge of the dough and firmly stretch & fold over the center, towards the left side of the dough. Again, press firmly down with your fingertips. Grab the lefthand side of the dough and stretch & fold to the righthand side. Finally, take the portion the dough near the top of the board, and stretch towards the bottom side, closest to you. Flip the whole thing over, so the board side is now facing up. All of the seams should now be tucked under the bundle. The air that was introduced here will allow more rise, and create more tension within the bread for a sturdy loaf., shape, You're now going to repeat the rounding shaping by cupping your hands on either side of the loaf and gently turning & pulling towards you at the same time. This will create additional tension & stretch the surface to hold the seams together., shape, Repeat the whole process with the second loaf., rest, Take two medium sized bowls, and spread two clean dish towels into them. Mix of 50/50 rice flour to whole wheat flour, to sprinkle liberally on the dish towels. I use bread flour often as well., rest, Using the bench scraper, gently lift the dough rounds and flip over (what was the top is now facing down) into the prepared bowls. Same with the second loaf. Cover loosely with plastic wrap (and I like to fold the edges of the dish towels over the top of the bowls)., rest, Let the bread rest overnight in the fridge before baking. 8-12 hours is plenty of fridge rest., rise, After your preferred rise time, preheat your oven to a whopping 475F (*important to note, I diverge with the book recommended 500 degree oven temperature here, because I don't think my oven can handle it). You are going to preheat your dutch oven (including the lid), in the oven at the same time. This takes about an hour., preheat, While the oven is preheating, cut a generous square of parchment paper for each loaf. Once your pot & oven are at temperature, set a heatproof trivet on the counter, and very carefully retrieve your pot., pot, Gently turn out one of the loaves onto the parchment and then - taking the sides of the parchment with oven mitts on - lower into the pot., cut, Using a sharp paring knife or bread slasher, slash at least three vents into the bread. I like to do three horizontal slits, about 1/2 inch deep., bake, Replace the lid, and carefully return to you hot oven., bake, Reduce the oven temperature to 450F. Bake for 30 minutes covered. After the first baking period, you will then bake uncovered, for an additional 30 minutes. Finally, crack the oven door open without touching the temperature, and bake a further 10 minutes., cool, After all the baking, retrieve your pot and carefully take your bread out of the pot. It should be golden brown, with small crackly bubbles. If you gently tap the bottom of the loaf, it should sound hollow. As the bread cools, it will snap & pop., bake, Repeat the baking process again with the second loaf, by placing the pot back into the oven and raising the temperature back up to 475F, and repeating the steps above. (Be sure to reduce the temperature to 450F when you place the pot back into the oven!)., cool, Let both loaves cool completely on a wire rack.","[('foamy sourdough starter', 200.0, 'grams'), ('warm spring water', 700.0, 'grams'), ('warm spring water', 50.0, 'grams'), ('unbleached bread flour', 900.0, 'grams'), ('whole wheat flour', 100.0, 'grams'), ('fine sea salt', 20.0, 'grams'), ('dried golden raisins', 128.0, 'grams'), ('dried mixed fruit', 128.0, 'grams'), ('slivered almonds', 128.0, 'grams'), ('strong black tea', 96.0, 'grams')]"

Mix the water and starter together briefly. Then add your flour and salt and mix whole lot together to form a shaggy dough. Cover your bowl with cling film or a damp tea towel and let it sit for around 1 hour. It's ok if it's a little bit longer, it's not going to matter too much.This process is called the ""autolyse"" and allows your flour to soak in all the water and become hydrated., Forming Up The DoughAfter the dough has been through autolyse you need to bring it together into a ball. Work your way around the bowl, grabbing the dough from the outside, stretching it up and over itself, into the centre, until a smooth ball is formed. You shouldn't need more than about 20-30 stretches to form the ball. You'll notice that the dough is fully hydrated after soaking all the water up. It will be fairly sticky but as you bring it into a ball, it will become smoother and shinier.Once the dough has formed into a smooth ball, pop the cling film back on and let it rest for 30 minutes., Stretch & Fold - Creating StructureOver the next few hours you need to create some structure for your dough by ""stretching and folding"". Aim to do around 4-6 sets of stretches and folds. For each set, stretch the dough up and over itself 4 times. Leave around 15 minutes in between each set. Again you do not have to be exact with time, but you need to do at least 4 sets over 2 hours., Bulk FermentOnce you've finished your stretch and folds, place the cling film or damp tea towel back over your dough and let it rest and ferment (a plastic cover is a better option for this stage). You want to allow your dough to rise until it's JUST UNDER DOUBLE.See notes below for more info on this step., Shaping The DoughOnce your dough has finished it's first ferment, it's time to shape it into either a boule or a batard. You'll need to flour your counter top with rice flour for this (we use rice flour because it has no gluten). Try to be quite sparing with the rice flour, you only need a very light dusting.Use a silicone dough scraper to gently ease the dough out of the bowl. You want it to land upside down on your counter so that the smooth top of the dough is on the countertop and the sticky underside is facing up. This will make it easier to shape.You want to pull the edges of the dough into the centre and then flip it over so that the sticky side is now underneath. Using the stickiness, gently pull the dough into a tight ball.You will need a banneton to put your dough into. If you do not have a banneton, then a bowl or basket lined with a floured tea towel is perfectly fine. Make sure your bowl isn't too big though, you want your dough to retain some shape.Whatever you're using needs to be liberally floured with your rice flour. If you're using a banneton - liberally sprinkle it with rice flour. If you're using a cloth or tea towel, rub the flour into it to ensure it becomes non stick., Placing Into A BannetonOnce the dough is shaped into a tight ball, place it into your banneton smooth side down, so your seam is on the top - this way the top of your dough will get the pretty lines from the banneton. If you're using a cloth or tea towel in a bowl it's ok to put your dough with the smooth side up. Just make sure the dough is tight.Lift your dough around the edges to pop a little more rice flour if you feel it needs it. Just try to handle the dough as little as possible and be really gentle as you really want to preserve all the gases and air bubbles that have formed during your bulk ferment., Cold FermentNow the dough is in its ""shaping container"" cover it loosely with a plastic bag or damp tea towel and place into the fridge. You will need to leave your shaped dough in the fridge between 24 to 48 hours (or anywhere in between). It's super important that your fridge is set to the correct temperature for this! If it's too warm, your dough will over ferment in the fridge.I use a large plastic bag to cover it - I just reuse it each time. This period of cold fermentation is the KEY to extra sour and tangy sourdough bread!, Preparing To BakeOnce you're ready to bake your sourdough, you'll need to preheat your oven to 230C/450F. Place your Dutch Oven into the oven when you turn it on so it gets HOT. Try to preheat for around 1 hour to ensure your oven is super hot - but you know your oven so just adjust this time if you need to.Leave your dough in the fridge until the very last minute - placing a cold dough into a hot oven will give you a great ""spring""., Bake Time!Now it's time to bake!When your oven is at temperature, take your sourdough out of the fridge. Gently place it onto a piece of baking paper. Make sure that you make the baking paper big enough to use the edges as a handle to lower to dough into your Dutch Oven.Gently score your bread with a lame, clean razor blade or knife. At minimum a large cross is sufficient, but you can get as artistic as you like. You can find my full guide on how to score sourdough bread here.Carefully take your dutch oven out of the oven. Place the sourdough into the pot using the baking paper as a handle. Put the lid on and place into the hot oven. If you want to you can spritz your dough with extra water before you put the lid on.BAKE TIME:30 Minutes with the lid on at 230C/450F plus10-15 Minutes with the lid off at 210C/410F, Finishing The BakeWhen you remove your dough from the oven, carefully remove it from the dutch oven as soon as possible and place on a wire rack to cool.","[('bread flour', 500.0, 'g'), ('water', 360.0, 'g'), ('sourdough starter', 20.0, 'g'), ('salt', 10.0, 'g')]"

Depending on the vigor of your starter and the temperature of your kitchen, this may take up to 5 hours (or even longer). For best results, gently deflate the dough once an hour by turning it out onto a lightly floured or lightly greased work surface; stretching and folding the edges into the center; turning it over, then returning it to the bowl. Adding these folds will help strengthen the dough’s structure, and allow you to feel how it’s progressing over time. ,       , , To preshape: Transfer the dough to lightly floured or lightly greased work surface. Gently divide it in half., Gently pat the dough to deflate it slightly and remove any large air bubbles. To make a loose round, stretch the outside edge of the dough away from itself and then fold it back toward the center, pressing it down to seal. Repeat this process five or six times, working your way around the dough until all the edges are gathered in the center. Turn the dough over so the seam is facing down, cover, and repeat with the other piece of dough. Let the dough rest, covered, for about 10 minutes. ,       , , To shape into bâtards: Place the preshaped dough on a lightly floured surface and stretch it gently from the top and bottom, elongating it into an oval. Gently pat the dough to remove any lingering bubbles. , Fold the top third of the dough down toward the center, as if folding a letter. Press with the heel of your hand to seal. Then fold the left and right top corners toward the center at 45° angles, pressing to seal. Repeat this process a second time. Then fold the dough in half, bringing the top edge to meet the bottom. Seal the seam with the heel of your hand, pressing firmly where the two edges meet.,       , , Turn the dough over so the seam is facing down. With cupped hands, gently roll the dough back and forth; your fingertips should be lightly touching its surface as you roll. Move your hands from the center out toward the edges, rounding the dough and tapering the ends very slightly by using more pressure.  , Place the bâtards on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.   ,           ,                   ,               ,               ,               ,                   ,   ,   , , Cover and let rise until very puffy, about 2 to 4 hours (or longer; give them sufficient time to become noticeably puffy). Don't worry if the loaves spread more than they rise; they'll pick up once they hit the oven's heat. Toward the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 425°F. , Spray the bâtards with lukewarm water; this will help them rise in the oven by keeping their crust soft and pliable initially. For an extra-crusty crust add steam to your oven: see details in “tips,” below. , Slash the bâtards. Try one slash down the length of the loaf, two diagonal slashes, or another symmetrical pattern of your choice. Make the slashes fairly deep; a serrated bread knife or lame, wielded firmly, works well here. ,       , , Bake the bâtards for 25 to 30 minutes, until they’re a very deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven and cool on a rack.   ,           ,                   ,               ,               ,               ,                   ,   ,   , , Store bâtards, loosely wrapped, for several days at room temperature; freeze for longer storage. ","[('sourdough starter', 1.0, 'cup'), ('water', 1.5, 'cups'), ('king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour', 5.0, 'cups'), ('table salt', 2.5, 'teaspoons')]"

The dough will look shaggy & will be very sticky at this point – & that’s totally fine! Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel & let rest in a warm, dry place for 12 hours., Preheat the oven, to 450 degrees Fahrenheit about 30 minutes before you are ready to bake the no-knead spicy cheese bread. Make sure one of the oven’s racks is positioned in the middle of the oven, & place an oven-safe dutch oven (at least 4-quart) on the rack, with its lid on, to heat along with the oven while it preheats. Once the oven is preheated, let the dutch oven sit in the hot oven for 20 minutes longer to really make sure it’s up to temperature – I literally set a cook timer for 20 minutes once the oven is preheated., Prep the dough, Meanwhile, as the oven preheats, transfer the no-knead spicy cheese bread dough to a large piece of parchment paper. I like to quickly spritz my hands with nonstick cooking spray – it makes it so much easier to handle the dough without it sticking to your hands! Using a pastry brush, brush the surface of the dough with the egg yolk, then sprinkle on the remaining 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes., Bake the no-knead spicy cheese bread, Once the dutch oven is up to temperature, very carefully remove it from the oven. Quickly & carefully remove the lid of the dutch oven, place the no-knead spicy cheese bread dough inside (you can just drop the parchment paper right in!), put the lid back on the dutch oven, & place the dutch oven back into the oven. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the lid from the dutch oven & bake, uncovered, for an additional 20 minutes, or until the dough is crusty & golden brown (see photos above for reference)., To serve,, carefully remove the bread from the dutch oven. You can just lift the parchment paper right out of the dutch oven. Allow to cool slightly before slicing or tearing the bread – remember it’s got molten-hot pools of melty cheese! Devour!

I like to do this by placing milk in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving it for 40-45 seconds. It should be like warm bath water. Transfer warm milk to the bowl of an electric mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Add in sugar, egg, egg yolk and melted butter. Mix until well combined. Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form., Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it's TOO sticky (meaning it's sticking to the bottom of the mixer, add in 2 tablespoons more bread flour.) If you don’t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface., Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour to 1 ½ hours, or until doubled in size. This may more or less time depending the humidity and temperature in your home., After dough has doubled in size, transfer dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a 14x9 inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over dough, leaving a ¼ inch margin at the far side of the dough., In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter., Tightly roll dough up, starting from the 9-inch side and place seam side down making sure to seal the edges of the dough as best you can. You will probably need to cut off about an inch off the ends of the dough as the ends won’t be as full of cinnamon sugar as we’d want it to be., Cut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife or floss. You should get 9 large pieces., Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x9 inch baking pan or round 9 inch cake pan. (I also recommend lining the pan with parchment paper as well, in case any of the filling ends up leaking out.) Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30-45 minutes., Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. You want to underbake them a little so they stay soft in the middle, that’s why we want them just slightly golden brown. Allow them to cool for 5-10 minutes before frosting. Makes 9 cinnamon rolls., To make the frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth and fluffy.

bd730ebf,https://whattomunch.com/walnut-sourdough-bread-is-tangy-crunchy-and-absolutely-delicious/,Walnut Sourdough Bread,"1 Active Sourdough starter, 800 grams bread flour (a little under 7 cups), 200 grams all-purpose flour (a little over 1 ½ cups), 700 grams water at room temperature (about 3 cups), 1 tablespoon sea salt or I use Pink Himalayan salt, 150 grams fed sourdough starter (around 1 cup), 2 cups raw walnuts (you can add even more)","Feed your starter about 6 – 8 hours before you want to start the dough process. I like to use 50% flour and 50% water. Let sit in a cool place, either overnight or starting early in the morning. If your sourdough has been resting in the fridge for a while, you will get a better rise if you feed the starter at least twice before starting the process. In that case, feed the starter a day or so before., The night before, in the early morning of the day before, or even better, 2 -3 days before you want to bake your walnut sourdough, (the longer it retards, the more it will develop flavor. After 3 days the sourdough will begin to die off. ), At the same time you start the last feeding or at least an hour before you want to start the dough mixing. Combine together in a large bowl or plastic tub the bread flour and the all-purpose flour. Do not use a metal container, it will react with the sourdough starter. Stir in the water. You do not need to thoroughly mix it in, just moisten as much flour as possible., When your starter has doubled or more, and is bubbly, it may look like it has fallen in on itself that is ok too. Measure out 150 grams and add it to the flour mixture., Using your hands, really get in there and mix it to thoroughly combine., Sprinkle the sea salt over the rough dough. With your hands again squeeze with your fingers, mash, and knead it until you can feel the salt crystals have dissolved. This may take a couple of minutes. You do not need to actually knead the dough into a ball, just make sure it has been thoroughly mixed., Scrape down the sides of whatever container you are using to incorporate the bits and edges into the dough and cover with a lid or plastic wrap., Let rest for 30 minutes or so. You can extend this to 45 to 50 if your schedule needs it., Have a bowl of water handy to wet your hands during the folding process., Uncover the dough, wet your hands with the water, and grasp one edge of the rested dough. Pull up and stretch out the dough several inches above the surface. Bring the dough over and push it down towards the further edge. Turn the bowl ¼ and repeat, stretching the dough again. Continue this until you have come full circle. The dough should have gathered into a rough ball. The water helps the dough from sticking to your hands and adds a bit more moisture., Cover again and let rest for another 30-45 minutes, Repeat the folding process 4 more times. See the next step:, After the 2nd fold, place the walnuts on a clean work surface and lightly roll over them with a rolling pin or glass to lightly crush them. Spread them over the resting dough. You will mix them in starting on the next fold., Each time the ball of dough will start out looking very flat and loose, as it relaxes. But it will tighten more and more after each fold. The final time the ball of dough will look very smooth, and the dough will have a lot of elasticity. It will gather into a nice tight ball., During the next fold, you will be incorporating the walnuts into the dough. Try and stretch and mix the walnuts into the relaxed dough. It doesn’t have to thoroughly be mixed in the next turn will mix the crushed nuts in more thoroughly., After the final fold, let the dough rest and rise until more than doubled with large bubbles very visible. It will take 5-6 hours in total from the first mix with the starter and the salt. All this depends on how active your starter is, the temperature of the room, and the humidity. Check every so often to see how the dough is behaving., Have 2 round baskets lined with clean tea towels ready. You can sprinkle some flour over them if you want. Though I have found if you have shaped nice and tight loaves, you will not need to flour them at all. If you shape firmly enough, you will find that you don’t need very much at all., Scrape the bread dough onto a floured work surface., Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Roughly gather them each into a ball and let rest for 10 – 15 minutes., Using a dough scraper pull the dough toward you onto a clean surface area. Using the tension of pulling with the dough scraper, and a slight circular motion continue to turn the dough ball ¼ turns and pulling towards you, using the scraper, until it forms into a tight ball. You should see many bubbles underneath the surface., Turn the dough, smooth side down into one of the prepared baskets. Pinch together the dough if there are and ragged surfaces., Repeat with the second ball of dough., Sprinkle a little flour over the tops of each loaf., Wrap each filled basket with plastic wrap and let sit for 1 hour if you have time. If you don’t, you can do the same hour at the end while the oven is heating. Or not at all if you feel the boules have risen enough. The loaves will not be as easy to slash this way, but if you are not trying to be perfect, it works on either end of the retarding process., Let sit in the refrigerator for 24-48 or even up to 72 hours. I have found the best for sour flavor is in the 48-72 hour area. But it all depends on your need and timing. To get the fantastic blisters, it needs to retard for at least 24 hours or longer., About 1 hour before you want to bake, place 2 dutch ovens in a cold oven with the lids askew. Let them heat at 500° for one full hour. If you did not let the dough rise for an hour, pull it out at the same time. If you did let it rise for an hour, pull the loaves out when you are ready to bake., Cut 2 parchment paper rounds approximately 12 inches across. Thoroughly crumple and wet under a running faucet. Place one down on a work surface and smooth it out. Or you can use a turntable which will make slashing it more manageable if you want to be fancy., Unmold one of the loaves onto the center of the wet parchment paper., Quickly slash the loaf., Using oven mitts carefully remove one of the dutch ovens and place it on a heatproof surface., Lift the slashed loaf by the parchment paper and carefully place it into the hot dutch oven. Using an oven mitt Immediately place the hot lid on to the filled dutch oven and place into the hot oven., Quickly repeat with the second loaf., Bake covered in the oven for 20 minutes., Uncover the dutch ovens and bake for an additional 20 – 25 minutes. The bread should be deeply golden, possibly even dark brown on the edges and sound hollow when tapped. Unmold onto a rack and remove the parchment paper., Let cool completely before slicing, if you can wait that long. It will slice easier. After about 15 minutes you can transport the hot loaves in paper grocery bags if you want to travel.","[('bread flour', 800, 'grams'), ('all-purpose flour', 200, 'grams'), ('water', 700, 'grams'), ('sea salt', 1, 'tablespoon'), ('fed sourdough starter', 150, 'grams'), ('walnuts', 2, 'cups')]"

It may look slightly dry but do not worry - it will mix together nicely in the next steps. If it is not coming together, add extra milk a teaspoon at a time. Increase the mixer speed to medium, and mix for another 10 minutes, until the dough is soft and smooth., Reduce the mixer speed to low, and add the butter a little at a time, waiting until it is fully incorporated into the dough before adding the next piece.
