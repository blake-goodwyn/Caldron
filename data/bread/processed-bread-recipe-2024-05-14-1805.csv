The water wont fully cover the oats - that's okay. Set aside., For the Dough:, Mix the Dough: In the evening, whisk the starter, milk, maple syrup and oil together in a large bowl with a fork. Add the flours and salt. First, mix with a fork, the dough will be shaggy. Then mix by hand, mixing, folding and pushing the dough until the flour is fully incorporated and no dry bits are present. It will seem dry at first, but the more you work the dough, the more hydrated it will become. The dough will feel stiff and it will stick to your fingers as you go. Do this for about 3-4 minutes. Use the fork to scrape off the dough on your fingers as much as you can. Cover bowl with a damp tea towel. Set a timer for for 30 minutes and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes. Now is a good time to feed/refresh your starter., Incorporate the Soaker: After the dough has rested, mix in the soaker. To do this, dump the soaker on top of the dough and begin kneading and folding the dough over and on top of itself, incorporating the ingredients of the soaker. Do this for about 2-3 minutes or until the soaker is evenly distributed in the dough. It will seem like a lot of added bits, but as you work the dough and as the dough develops through fermentation, the soaker will incorporate. The dough will be stiff, wet and sticky. Cover bowl with a damp tea towel, set a timer for 30 minutes and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes., Fold the Dough: After the dough has rested, fold the dough. To do this, grab a portion of the dough while it remains in the bowl, stretch it up and fold it over, pressing your fingertips into the center of the dough. You'll notice the dough is a little less stiff and more workable at this point. Repeat, until you've worked your way around the dough. If the dough feels *too* stiff, you can always let it rest another 15 minutes. This is the first fold, and you can stop here and begin bulk fermentation, but If time permits, and optimally, you'll want to repeat this fold two more times as it improves the final dough's structure and crumb. Allow for about 30 minutes between the second and third fold., Bulk Fermentation (first rise): After the last fold, cover the bowl with a damp towel and allow to rise overnight at room temperature (see note* on optionally retarding the dough). This will take about 8-10 hours at 70F (21C), but in a cooler kitchen the dough can take up to 12-14 hours to rise - this is the norm in my chilly kitchen 66F (18C). Use the time as a guide and not a determining factor. The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense, is jiggly when the bowl is shaken, and has about doubled in size., Shape the Dough: In the morning, and with damp fingertips, coax the dough into a floured work-surface. With moist fingers, take a portion of the dough, gently stretch it towards you and fold it over towards the center, pressing it down gently. Repeat this process until you work the dough all the way around the dough. Using a bench scraper flip the dough over, cover with a tea towel rest the dough for 15-20 minutes. While the dough rests, throughly coat the inside of a 9x5"" (23cm X 12cm) loaf pan with olive or coconut oil. Set aside.Flour the work surface and using a bench scraper flip the dough back over. Use the photos in the blog post to help guide shaping. Gently shape the dough into a rough rectangle (sort of a football/oblong shape if you can) by dimpling the dough (think focaccia), to roughly 6"" wide and 8-10"" long. Fold the dough lengthwise 2/3 over onto itself and crease it firmly using the pinky side of your hand. Fold the 1/3 piece left towards the crease and pinch the seam closed. Fold in the ends, coming in about an 3/4"" - 1"" and pinch the seam closed. Flip the bread over and rock it back and fourth a bit and gently fluff the ends in. Cover with a tea towel and allow the dough to rest for about 5-10 minutes. Scrape your work surface area of any excess flour and very lightly spritz it with water. Place the dough on the spritz of water (seam side down) and using lightly floured hands, cup the back of the dough and gently pull it towards you until the surface is taught. Gently ""fluff"" the ends in again if needed to fit into the loaf pan.Once the surface is taut and with one swift move, use the bench scraper to scoop the dough up and, place the dough into the prepared loaf pan. If there's any misshapen edges that need tucking in, use a moist rubber spatula to gently finesse and shape the edges of the dough down into the pan., Proof the Dough (second rise): Cover the pan with a damp tea towel and allow the dough to rise until the dough rises to about 3/4"" - 1"" (2cm - 2.54cm) above the lip of the pan at the center of the dough. The amount of time will vary depending on ambient temperature. At 70F (21C) proofing takes about an hour. In my chilly kitchen, about two hours.Set an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat your oven to 450F (232C)., Bake the Dough: Lightly spritz the top of your loaf with water and sprinkle 1-2 Tbs of Rolled oats over the top. Place the loaf into the oven and then, reduce the oven temperature to 400F (204C). Bake for 45-55 minutes, rotating and tenting the loaf at about 25-30 minutes so it doesn't get too dark. The bread is ready when the internal temperature of the loaf is between 190F - 205F (87C - 96C). When done, transfer to a wire rack. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a cooling rack. Cool 1 hour before slicing., Storage Notes: Sourdough is best consumed on the same day it's baked, but it lasts for 3-4 days stored at room temperature. Store at room temperature cut side down.This bread freezes beautifully. Store baked bread in a freezer bag either whole or sliced for up to two weeks. Thaw at room temperature.

Dough is too sticky for a mixer.), 1st rise, Cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and set on the counter at room temperature—honestly any normal room temperature is fine. Allow to rise for 12-18 hours. (See note if you need to extend this time.) Depending on the size of your mixing bowl, the dough will mostly rise out to the sides of the bowl instead of rising up. Some upward rise is normal if your bowl is on the smaller side. The dough will stick to the sides of the bowl and have a lot of air bubbles.

Dough is very sticky, but the extra flour makes it more manageable. Pour dough (and any excess flour that is not mixing in) onto work surface. Using lightly floured hands, gently form into a loaf shape, about 8×4 inches. Does not have to be perfect, so don’t over-think the shape or overwork the dough.

Use a wooden spoon or the flat beater of your stand mixer to mix on low speed until flour is completely combined.

If making by hand, you can continue using a wooden spoon, or switch to a Danish dough whisk at this point., Add flour mixture, 32 grams (1/4 cup) at a time, adding more once the previous addition is fully incorporated into the dough. You might not need all of the flour mixture. The dough is ready when it pulls away from the sides of the bowl and does not leave dough residue on the sides of the bowl., Turn the dough out onto a very lightly floured work surface and knead by hand for about two minutes before adding any additional flour.

Alternately, you can check your dough by doing the finger poke test, which is my favorite way to test bread dough!, Use a digital kitchen scale to separate the dough into two equal halves. Use your fingers to shape the first half into a rough rectangle. Fold the short end of the rectangle up 1/3 of the way and use the heel of your hand to seal the dough. Fold the resulting triangular-shaped sides of the dough into the loaf and use the heel of your hand to seal. Repeat this two more times, until you have a loaf shape. Then, pinch the final seam and roll gently over the seam to form the final seal. (Confused about how to shape sandwich bread loaves? Check out my video tutorial on YouTube!), Place the loaf into an 8.5″x4.5″ loaf pan, seam side down, and repeat step 10 with the second half of the dough., Allow the loaves to rise for another 35-45 minutes, or until the loaves are roughly 1” over the top of the loaf pans., During the final rise (proofing) time, preheat your oven to a true 400°F.

Also, during this time, add the egg and one teaspoon of water to a small bowl and scramble thoroughly., When the loaves are finished proofing, gently brush egg wash over both loaves.

If you have a sprouting lid and jar, rest the jar inverted at an angle in a bowl for drainage. If you do not have a sprouting lid, pour the berries into a colander for draining and rinsing, and then rest the colander in a bowl and cover it with a towel or loosely with plastic. The berries should be at room temperature and in a relatively dark place., Repeat the rinsing and draining every 8-12 hours until little sprouts emerge from the berries. Let the spouts grow to between 1/8 and 1/4 inch. The sprouts will be of different length, so go for a loose average. The entire process should take 24-48 hours from the start of the soak., Store the sprouted berries in your refrigerator, drained, for up to 5 days. If they get white fuzz in that time, it is because they are thirsty and growing mini shoots to extract moisture from the air. This isn't mold.

I did 4 every 20 minutes.

See this Breadtopia video if you need more details on pre-shaping., Let the dough rest for 15 minutes while you wash the dough bowl and prep your proofing basket. There are many ways to prep a proofing basket. I sprinkled bran flakes onto a previously floured tea towel laid flat on the counter., Flour your hands and the dough, flip the dough, tuck under the edges while rotating it to create a boule shape., Put your boule in the basket, seam side down and cover.

Put your blueberries into a small bowl and cover them with 10g of Maple Syrup and just enough boiling water to cover them. Cover with cling wrap and put aside until you need them (these can be made the day before if you want, but as long as they sit for an hour they will be fine)., Add your lemon zest to the brown sugar. Use a spoon to mash them together a little and then let them sit while you prepare the dough. The sugar will emulsify with the lemon zest and become glossy., Premix & Autolyse:Weigh out your sourdough starter and water into a large ceramic or glass bowl. This recipe is based on you having an active starter that you have fed a few hours before starting your bake.Mix the water and starter together briefly. Then add your flour and salt and mix together with the end of a wooden spoon. The dough will be fairly shaggy and only just brought together., Cover your bowl with cling film or a damp tea towel and let it sit for around 1 hour. It's ok if it's a little longer., Forming Up Your Dough:After the dough has been through autolyse, you need to bring it together into a ball. You'll notice that the dough is fully hydrated after soaking up all the liquid. It will be fairly sticky but as you bring it into a ball, it will become smoother and shinier.6Work your way around the bowl, grabbing the dough from the outside and stretching it up and over itself until a smooth ball is formed. You shouldn't need more than 20-25 folds to form the ball, you might need less. You just need to let the dough tell you Once the dough has formed into a smooth ball, pop the cling film back on and let it rest for around 30 minutes., Stretch & Folds / Adding Flavors:Over the next few hours, you need to create some structure for you dough by stretching and folding. Aim to do around 4-6 sets of stretches and folds. For each set, stretch the dough up and over itself 4 times. You'll find it gets easier to do at each set as the gluten in your dough develops.8, Around your second or third set of stretch and folds, add the drained blueberries and sweet lemon zest. Try to incorporate them without disturbing all the beautiful bubbles that will be forming in your dough. I find it's easiest to actually get your dough out of the bowl and pop it on the bench top. Add the flavors on top of the dough and gently stretch and fold the dough around them. Don't worry if they aren't all through your dough on the first add - you'll have them worked through by the last set., Bulk Ferment:Once you've finished your stretch and folds, place the cling film or damp tea towel back over your dough and let it rest and ferment., Shaping Your Dough:Once your dough has finished its bulk ferment, you need to shape it. I've chosen to shape into a boule for this recipe, but you can use any shape you prefer., Once you're happy with the shape, place your dough into your banneton or bowl, ensuring that you've liberally floured whatever you are using., Cold Ferment:Now your dough is in it's shaping container, cover it loosely with a plastic bag or damp tea towel and place it into the fridge.Try to leave it for a minimum of 5 hours, up to a maximum of 36 hours. The longer you leave it, the better your bread will be., Preparing To Bake:Once you're ready to bake your sourdough, you'll need to preheat your oven to 230C/450F. Place your Dutch Oven into the oven when you turn it on so that it gets hot. Try to preheat for around 1 hour to ensure your oven is super hot - but you know your oven, so just adjust this time if you need to.Leave the dough in the fridge until the very last minute., Time To Bake!When your oven is at temperature, take your sourdough out of the fridge. Gently place it onto a piece of baking paper or parchment paper.Gently score your bread with a lame, clean razor blade or knife. A cross is sufficient, but you can get as artistic as you like.Carefully take your Dutch Oven out of the oven. Place the sourdough into the pot using the baking paper as a handle. Put the lid on and place into the hot oven. If you want you can spritz your dough with extra water before you put the lid on., BAKE TIME:Bake your sourdough for 30 minutes with the lid on at 230C/450F plus12-15 minutes with the lid off at around 200C/390F. Keep an eye on your bread at this stage - because it has blueberries and sugar in it, the sugar can make the top go very dark, very quickly.I tend to turn my oven back to 200C for the last 10-15 minutes with the lid off as I don't want to caramelise the crust too much on this one. I find a lighter crust works better with the delicate lemon flavor., Once the time has elapsed, remove your sourdough from your Dutch Oven. Turn off your oven and place the sourdough back into the oven, directly on your oven rack. Let it cool in here with the door ajar for 1-2 hours.","[('sourdough starter', 75.0, 'g'), ('water', 350.0, 'g'), ('bread flour', 500.0, 'g'), ('salt', 10.0, 'g'), ('dried blueberries', 25.0, 'g'), ('maple syrup', 10.0, 'g'), ('brown sugar', 20.0, 'g')]"

Turn the dough out onto a clean, unfloured, work surface and divide into 8 pieces. Form each piece into a ball by rolling on the countertop with a cupped hand. As you work with each piece through the next few steps, keep the dough that you’re not working with covered in plastic wrap., Sprinkle a few drops of water onto the countertop. Take each dough ball and roll into a rope about 9 inches long. Place one hand palm up so that your four fingers are centered on top of the rope. Fold each side of the dough over your fingers, so that the ends overlap by about 2 inches. (see photo above). Holding the dough, turn your hand over and roll your hand on the countertop to seal the two ends together., Place each finished piece onto a baking sheet.

If the dough seems too wet to a point where kneading (next step) would be impossible, beat in more flour 1 Tablespoon at a time until you have a workable dough, similar to the photos above. Dough should be soft and a little sticky, but still manageable to knead with lightly floured hands., Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 8–10 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 8–10 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour at a time to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need; you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1.5–2 hours or until about double in size.

If you're not observing Passover though, you can take your time, and you may want to double or triple the recipe all at once, rather than bake in multiple start-to-finish batches., Place a large baking sheet or pizza stone in your oven one level up from the middle shelf. Preheat to 475°F -- for about 20 minutes if you're using an aluminum baking sheet, and for about 30 minutes if you're using a stone. I used an aluminum sheet and found there was no need for parchment paper to prevent sticking., Measure all the ingredients, and then mix them together in a bowl. (I used my hand from the get-go and segued into kneading with that messy hand.) If you want to make the matzo in less than 18 minutes, start the timer just before you add liquids to the flour., Knead the dough on a clean surface for 2-3 minutes, and add more flour or water as needed to get a pliable and not-sticky consistency., With a rolling pin, roll the dough into a very thin oval sheet about 1/16"" to 1/8"" thick (see the photo above). Use flour as needed to roll the sheet and shift it around., With a fork or a pastry docker, poke holes on both sides of the sheet., Cut the sheet into six pieces. If desired, trim the edges so you have rectangles. Then collect all the scraps, knead them into a ball, adding a few drops of water if needed to get the dough to come together. Then quickly roll out one more matzo (round) with this leftover dough and poke holes on both sides of it too., Carefully pull your hot baking sheet from the oven, and transfer the matzos onto it., Bake for 2 minutes, then flip over each matzo. Also turn your baking sheet around if one side is browning faster than the other., Bake for another 2 minutes, keeping a close eye on the matzos during the last minute because if you happen to roll slightly thinner or thicker dough than I did, you may need a minute less or a minute more to get slight opacity of the matzos and a few brown spots., Remove the matzos from the oven and cool them on a rack., Once completely cooled, the matzos can be stored in an airtight container for several days or longer.","[('whole grain spelt flour', 1.0, 'cup'), ('spelt berries', 130.0, 'g'), ('water', 0.25, 'cup'), ('light olive oil', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('salt', 0.25, 'tsp')]"

This step is necessary so that they don’t burn while baking the bread., Mix the whole wheat flour and the spelt flour in a large bowl. Add the spices and salt and incorporate them well., In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in lukewarm water. If it's too hot then it can kill the yeast, so it's best to stick to lukewarm water (around 110ºF/43ºC). This usually takes a few minutes., Add the yeast mixture into the flour bowl and mix until you obtain a sticky dough. (If you want to add some natural sweetener then add that at this point)., Knead the dough for about 10-15 minutes until it becomes uniform, soft and elastic. This can also be done in a stand mixer for between 8-10 minutes., Roll the dough into a ball, wet it with some olive oil, and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel and set aside for 1 hour so the dough can rise to around double its size., Remove the dough from the bowl, knocking out some air while you shape the dough into a 'loaf' shape that is slightly thinner than the width of your loaf tin (see video). The same goes for individual loaves - simply divide your dough evenly and shape accordingly.Note* If you want to add any seeds/additives into your bread, then you'd add them at this point, just after the first proving., Prepare your bread loaf tin and grease it or line it with baking paper or a bread tin liner. I use a paper liner, which I lightly flour., Place the shaped dough inside the tin. Then drain the presoaked seeds from any excess water and place them on top of the dough., Let the bread proof for another 45 minutes, covered with a damp tea towel. It should double in size, but make sure to not overprove as this can lead to deflated bread with a coarse texture., In the meantime, preheat the oven to 480ºF/250ºC. First place 2 baking trays as follows:-One tray in the middle of the oven – this is where the bread loaf tin goes-One tray in the bottom of the oven – this is where a bit of hot water goes just before baking the bread. The water helps keep the environment moist and will create a nice crispy crust for the loaf., When you are ready to bake, carefully pour a cup of water into the bottom tray (it will be hot so can steam immediately). Then place the bread on the middle shelf., Bake time will be between 15-20 minutes. If you want to be double sure that it has baked all the way through then you can use a thermometer and check for a temperature between 190-200ºF/~90ºC (although, I've never found this necessary), Once baked, set aside to cool down before you cut the bread. Storage:If the bread is not sliced yet, you can keep it unwrapped at room temperature. This way it will retain its freshness. Once sliced, keep well wrapped with a tea towel or foil at room temperature for 2-3 days. Alternatively, you can keep it in a bread box as those are meant to trap the moisture inside, so the bread doesn't dry out. To keep longer, freeze for up to 3 months. You can freeze the bread cut into slices, that way it's easy to take out and unfreeze as many as need. Remember, even if your bread has gone a bit stale then you can still use it for various things including croutons and bread pudding.","[('whole wheat flour', 250.0, 'grams'), ('wholemeal flour', 250.0, 'grams'), ('fresh yeast', 10.0, 'grams'), ('salt', 2.0, 'tsp'), ('mixed spices', 1.5, 'tbsp'), ('lukewarm water', 340.0, 'ml'), ('mixed seeds', 3.0, 'tbsp')]"

Then continue to slowly add flour 1/2 Cup at a time until the dough quits sticking to the sides of the bowl. It should be tacky to the touch. The trick is to have enough consistency to stand up with the least amount of flour so the bread will be fluffy. It will most likely be 6 1/2 cups but in any case do not exceed 7 1/2 cups of wheat flour. You can trade one cup of wheat flour for one cup of all purpose white if you wish. Don't over mix or the bread will be tough., When your dough is finished, leave it in the mixer, cover the bowl and let it rise for about 30-45 minutes. The dough will be larger but it doesn't need to double., Grease two bread pans with Crisco. You can also flour the pans to reduce sticking., Mix the dough again just enough to knock it down at least close to the original size., Drop the dough on a floured surface so you can work the dough and shape it. Shape it with your hands to make a nice ball getting enough flour on it so it isn't sticky. Divide the ball in half and do it again. Shape the loaves by turning the dough under it's self over and over. When the dough is shaped the sides and ends will be sealed and all you will see is a nice oblong shaped loaf with smooth sides and top. Drop the loaves in your bread pans and let them rise until almost doubled. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 for 36 minutes. If you forgot to preheat 41 minutes.

Stir with a rubber spatula to loosely combine. Add the flour, and stir with a spatula to combine — it will be a wet, sticky dough ball. Transfer to a straight-sided vessel and cover with a tea towel or bowl cover for 30 minutes., Stretch and fold, . After 30 minutes, grab a corner of the dough and pull it up and into the center. Repeat until you’ve performed this series of folds 4 to 5 times with the dough. Let dough rest for another 30 minutes and repeat the stretching and folding action. If you have the time: do this twice more for a total of 4 times in 2 hours. [Video guidance here.] Note: Even if you can only perform one series of stretches and folds, your dough will benefit. So don’t worry if you have to run off shortly after you mix the dough., Bulk fermentation, Cover the vessel with a tea towel or bowl cover and let rise at room temperature (70ºF/21ºC) for 4 to 18 hours (times will vary based on the time of year, the humidity, and the temperature of your kitchen). The bulk fermentation will end when the dough has nearly doubled in volume and you can see bubbles throughout the dough and on the surface. (Note: Do not use your oven with the light on for the bulk fermentation — it is too warm for the dough. To determine when the bulk fermentation is done, it is best to rely on visual cues (doubling in volume) as opposed to time. A straight-sided vessel makes monitoring the bulk fermentation especially easy because it allows you to see when your dough has truly doubled.), Shape, Gently transfer the dough to clean work surface. I prefer to use no flour and a bench scraper at this step, but if you find an un-floured work surface to be difficult, feel free to lightly flour it. [Video guidance is especially helpful for this step.] Fold the dough, envelope style: top third over to the center; bottom third up and over to the center. Then repeat from right to left. Turn the dough over and use your bench scraper to push the dough up, then back towards you to create a tight ball. Repeat this pushing and pulling till you feel you have some tension in your ball. Place the dough ball top side down and let rest 30 to 40 minutes. (FYI: This is called the bench rest.), Proof, Line a shallow 2-qt bowl (or something similar) with a tea towel or flour sack towel. Flour sack towels are amazing because the dough doesn’t stick to them, and therefore you need very little rice flour, but if you only have a tea towel, you will be fine. If you are using a tea towel, sprinkle it generously with rice flour. If you are using a flour sack towel, you can use a lighter hand with the rice flour. After the 30-to 40-minute bench rest, repeat the envelope-style folding and the bench scraper pushing and pulling till you have a tight ball. [Video guidance here.] Place the ball top side down in your prepared towel-lined bowl. Cover bowl with overhanging towel. Transfer bowl to the fridge for 12 to 24 hours. (Note: When you remove your dough from the fridge, visually it will likely look unchanged. This is OK. You do not need to let it then proof at room temperature before baking.), Bake, Heat oven to 500ºF. Remove your sourdough from the fridge. Open the towel. Place a sheet of parchment over the bowl. Place a plate over the parchment. With a hand firmly on the plate and one on the bowl, turn the dough out onto the parchment-paper lined plate. [Video guidance here.] Carefully remove the bowl and towel. Carefully remove the plate. Brush off any excess rice flour. Use a razor blade to score the dough as you wish. I always do a simple X. Grab the ends of the parchment paper and transfer to the Dutch oven. [Video guidance here.] Cover it. Lower oven temperature to 450ºF, bake covered for 30 minutes. Uncover.

To avoid over proofed dough, I like to start mixing in the afternoon (usually between 2-3 PM) when I know I’ll be home to stretch and fold the dough. Please adjust your rise times based on temperature., Make the Dough, Combine the sourdough starter and water in a large bowl. Add the flour and salt. Mix with a fork and then finish by hand to fully incorporate the flour. It will feel very wet and sticky. Cover with a damp towel or wrap and let rest for 1 hour on your countertop, returning to the bowl after the first 30 minutes to work the dough into a rough ball., Bulk Rise with Stretch and Folds, After the dough has rested for 1 hour, do your first fold., Gather a portion of the dough, stretch it upward, and fold it over toward the center of the bowl. Give the bowl a 1/4 turn and repeat 3 more times, stretch and folding the dough to come full circle around the bowl (4 folds = 1 set). If the dough still feels slack after the 1st set, do an additional 4 folds around the bowl to tighten the dough., For best results, do 4 sets total spaced 30 minutes apart resting the covered dough in a warm spot in between each set (see tip below). Notice how the dough will tighten after the 4th set. See video for technique., When finished with the folds, cover the bowl and continue the bulk rise (untouched) at 75-78 F for about for 2-3 hours. The dough is ready when it has almost doubled in size. Wrap and chill the whole bowl overnight; the dough will continue to rise only slightly in the fridge when the dough is warm., How to Create Warm Spot for Bread Dough, Preheat your home oven to the lowest setting for 30- 45 seconds and then shut it off. Place the covered bowl of dough inside to bulk up. The temperature should be 75-78 F and no higher than 80 F. Use an oven thermometer (and common sense) to keep track of the temperature. Dough that is too warm will become wet, sticky, and a tricky to work with. Alternatively, I highly recommend using a proofing box., Shape the Dough, The following morning, make sure the dough has doubled in size. If not, give it more time to bulk up, if needed. This is important to build strength., Line a small bowl (or proofing basket) with a cotton or linen cloth. Sprinkle with flour. You’re going to shape the dough twice to build extra strength., Preshape, Remove the cold dough onto a floured surface. Let rest for 10-15 minutes to take some of the chill off. Shape the dough into a loose ball using the envelope technique. Starting at the top of the dough, stretch and fold it over toward the center. Then stretch and fold the bottom of the dough toward the center. Repeat on the left side…and then the right side. Using a bench scraper, scoop up the dough and flip it over so the smooth side is facing up. Cover and rest for 20-30 minutes., Final Shape, After the dough has rested, flip it over again (the smooth side should be facing down now). Shape it again following the steps above. Flip it back over. With floured hands, gently cup the dough and pull it toward you in a circular motion to tighten its shape. Place the dough into the lined bowl or proofing basket seam side up. Cover with the cloth overhang., Second Rise, Rest in the warm spot you used earlier for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The dough is ready when it looks puffy and has risen slightly, but has not yet doubled in size. The dough should not be very cold prior to baking., Preheat your oven to 450 towards the tail end of the second rise., Cut a sheet of non-stick parchment paper to fit the size of your baking pot, leaving enough excess around the sides to remove the bread., Score the Dough, Place the parchment over the dough and invert the bowl to release. Sprinkle the dough with flour and gently rub the surface with your hands. Using the tip of a bread lame, small, serrated knife or a razor blade, make four shallow 4-inch long cuts at 3, 6, 9, and 12 o’clock around the dough. Use the parchment paper to transfer the dough to a Dutch oven (or another oven safe pot with lid)., Bake the Dough, Bake the dough on the center rack for 20 minutes, covered. Remove the lid, and continue to bake for 40 minutes and golden brown., When finished, transfer to a wire rack.

Stir to combine and set aside for a few minutes., To the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, or to a large mixing bowl (if you plan to make the bread by hand), add the milk, oil, egg and salt and whisk together until combined., Add the yeast mixture to the milk mixture and add the flours and multigrain mix on top (you can soak the multigrain mix for a few minutes in hot water first, if you want, but be sure to drain it well before adding. This step is not necessary)., Stir everything together well until a dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface if making by hand, or knead the dough in your stand mixer with the dough hook attachment until the dough is smooth and elastic., If making by hand, flour your hands and begin the kneading process. When kneading bread dough, always start by putting your hand under the edge of the dough farthest away from you and pulling it up and toward you. Then, push it down and away from you, and into the rest of the dough. Keep repeating this motion while turning the dough 90 degrees clockwise every few kneads. It's also important to scoop up the doughy and floury bits on the counter and knead them into the dough as well. The goal is to end up with a smooth and elastic ball of dough., Add as little extra flour as possible when kneading, but continue kneading for about 5-10 minutes until the dough is very smooth and elastic. Under-kneading is a very common problem when making bread by hand and it results in loaves that are rock hard on the outside, too dense on the inside, and don't get enough height in the oven. It's almost impossible to over-knead bread when you're kneading by hand because it's such hard work. So if you think you've kneaded long enough, keep kneading for at least another few minutes., Return the dough to its bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest in a warm, draft-free place until it doubles in size (about 1 hour and 20 minutes should do)., Once the dough has risen, grease 2 loaf pans with butter and set them aside., Flour your hands again and punch the dough down until it deflates completely. Divide the dough evenly into 2 pieces and let them rest on the counter for about 5-10 minutes before shaping into loaves. This will make the shaping process easier as it allows the gluten to relax and makes the dough softer and easier to work with., Shaping the Loaves:, After letting it rest, shape the dough into a rectangle (with the short end about the same length as the long side of your loaf pan)., Fold one short end into the middle and press with your fingers to seal., Fold the other short end into middle and press with your fingers to seal., Pinch the sides and pull them in slightly., Flip the whole thing over and tuck the ends under again. Place the loaf into the greased loaf pan., Second Rise and Baking:, Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the shaped loaves in their pans under a clean tea towel (I have a few I reserve just for this purpose) and let them rise for 25 minutes., Check them after 15 minutes, to make sure they haven't over-risen. If they're ok, wait at least another 10 minutes before checking again. They should be larger but not so large that they're overflowing the pans., This second rise is very important. If the loaves under-proof they'll be dense and chewy. If they over-proof, they'll have large holes (especially right under the crust) and they'll fall apart easily., Bake the loaves at 400 degrees for about 20-25 minutes. Because every oven is different, watch the loaves after 18 minutes to ensure they're not becoming too brown on top., Let the loaves cool in their pans for about 5 minutes before turning them out onto a cooling rack to cool completely., As always, the loaves will continue to bake on the inside even after you've removed them from the heat of the oven, so it's important to resist the urge to cut into them until they have cooled almost completely.","[('water', 0.25, 'cup'), ('yeast', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('honey', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('milk', 2.0, 'cups'), ('oil', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('salt', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('flour', 4.0, 'cups'), ('flour', 2.0, 'cups'), ('mix', 1.0, 'cup'), ('water', 2.0, 'tablespoons')]"

Mix the water and starter together briefly. Then add your flour and salt and mix altogether with the end of a wooden spoon.The dough will be fairly shaggy and only just brought together. Cover your bowl with cling film or a damp tea towel and let it sit for around 1 hour. It's ok if it's a little bit longer, it's not going to matter too much.This process is called the ""autolyse"" and allows your flour to soak in all the water and become hydrated., Forming Up Your Dough:After the dough has been through autolyse you need to bring it together into a ball. You'll notice that the dough is fully hydrated after soaking all the water up. It will be fairly sticky but as you bring it into a ball, it will become smoother and shinier.Work your way around the bowl, grabbing the dough from the outside, stretching it up and over itself until a smooth ball is formed. You shouldn't need more than about 20-25 folds to form the ball.Once the dough has formed into a smooth ball, pop the cling film back on and let it rest for 30 minutes., Stretch & Folds:Over the next few hours you need to create some structure for your dough by ""stretching and folding"". Aim to do around 4-6 sets of stretches and folds. For each set, stretch the dough up and over itself 4 times. Leave around 15 minutes in between each set. Again you do not have to be exact with time, but you need to do at least 4 sets over 2 hours.You will need to really work the dough to develop the gluten - because whole wheat and particularly rye flour have a lower gluten content., Bulk Ferment:Once you've finished your stretch and folds, place the cling film or damp tea towel back over your dough and let it rest and ferment (see notes)., Shaping Your Dough:Once your dough has finished it's first ferment, it's time to form it back into a ball and give it some shape and surface tension. You'll need to flour your counter top with rice flour for this (we use rice flour because it has no gluten). Try to be quite sparing with the rice flour, you only need a very light dusting.Use a silicone dough scraper to gently ease the dough out of the bowl. You want it to land upside down on your counter so that the smooth top of the dough is on the countertop and the sticky underside is facing up. This will make it easier to shape.You can shape into whatever you like. I prefer this one as a batard., Once the dough is shaped into a tight ball, place it into your banneton smooth side down, so your seam is on the top - this way the top of your dough will get the pretty lines from the banneton. If you're using a cloth or tea towel in a bowl it's ok to put your dough with the smooth side up. Just make sure the dough is tight.Lift your dough around the edges to pop a little more rice flour if you feel it needs it. Just try to handle the dough as little as possible and be really gentle as you really want to preserve all the gases and air bubbles that have formed during your bulk ferment., You will need a banneton to put your dough into. If you do not have a banneton, then a bowl or basket lined with a floured tea towel is perfectly fine. Make sure your bowl isn't too big though, you want your dough to retain some shape.Whatever you're using needs to be liberally floured with your rice flour. If you're using a banneton - liberally sprinkle it with rice flour. If you're using a cloth or tea towel, rub the flour into it to ensure it becomes non stick., Cold Ferment:Now your dough is in it's ""shaping container"" cover it loosely with a plastic bag or damp tea towel and place into the fridge. I use a large plastic bag to cover it - I just reuse it each time. It's not totally essential to cover it - you can place it in the fridge uncovered if you'd prefer.Try to leave it in the fridge for a minimum 5 hours up to a maximum of around 36 hours. The longer you leave it the better your bread will be! A longer cold ferment creates beautiful blisters on your crust and a deeper sourdough flavour. It will also ensure your dough forms a skin which makes it easier to score., Preparing to Bake Your Sourdough:Once you're ready to bake your sourdough, you'll need to preheat your oven to 230C/450F. Place your Dutch Oven into the oven when you turn it on so it gets hot. Try to preheat for around 1 hour to ensure your oven is super hot - but you know your oven so just adjust this time if you need to.Leave your dough in the fridge until the very last minute - placing a cold dough into a hot oven will give you a great ""spring""., Baking Your Sourdough:When your oven is at temperature. Take your sourdough out of the fridge. Gently place it onto a piece of baking paper. Make sure that you make the baking paper big enough to use the edges as a handle to lower to dough into your Dutch Oven.Gently score your bread with a lame, clean razor blade or knife. Carefully take your dutch oven out of the oven. Place the sourdough into the pot using the baking paper as a handle. Put the lid on and place into the hot oven. If you want to you can spritz your dough with extra water before you put the lid on.BAKE TIME:30 Minutes with the lid on at 230C/450F plus10-15 Minutes with the lid off at 210C/410F, Finishing Your Bake:When you remove your dough from the oven, carefully remove it from the dutch oven as soon as possible and place on a wire rack to cool.","[('sourdough starter', 100.0, 'g'), ('bread flour', 250.0, 'g'), ('whole wheat flour', 230.0, 'g'), ('rye flour', 20.0, 'g'), ('water', 400.0, 'g'), ('salt', 10.0, 'g')]"

Cover the bowl and rest/autolyse for 1 hour until the levain is ready., Measure out 70 grams of levain and add it to the bowl of autolysed dough. Mix with your hands for 3-4 minutes. The mixing technique is demonstrated in the recipe video above. Cover your bowl and rest for 30 minutes., Add the salt and continue mixing for another 3-4 minutes until the dough has a smooth surface.

Whisk thoroughly until combined, with a fork. Add flours, and mix together first with the fork to start to incorporate, then with your hands until a shaggy dough is formed, and the bits of flour left just disappear. Sprinkle the salt on top and do not mix in, just leave it on top. Cover with a damp cloth., Autolyse: let dough sit for one hour, covered and undisturbed., Bulk ferment: Now you will knead the salt that is sitting on top, into the dough for about 2 1/2 minutes. There is no precise way to do this, just think of working the dough through your hands and up against the bowl, push and pull. You will start to feel the dough relax a bit around 1 minute. Then leave the dough alone, covered, for 30 minutes. This counts as your first set of stretch and folds., After those 30 minutes pass, perform a set of stretch and folds. Repeat 2 more times., Now you will let sit, undisturbed and covered with a damp cloth, for the remainder of its bulk fermentation. You will know it is finished with its bulk ferment when the dough has risen about 75% (just short of doubling) in size, is smooth and puffy on top, with a few bubbles around the edges. It will not be as jiggly as some sourdough you've made before. I find this takes between 5-7 hours, depending on the temperature of your home. If the temperature in your home is above 72 degrees, this will be on the lower end; if it is cooler it will take on the longer end. Always go by the look and feel of your dough to know when it is finished proofing rather than time., When finished with bulk fermentation, lightly dust your work surface with flour. Put dough onto the work surface, and pre-shape. Then let sit for 15 minutes on your work surface., Then shape your dough using the video attached here as a guide., Place dough into your flour dusted banneton, (or flour dusted linen lined banneton) seam side up. (Optional, you can wait 15 minutes after placing it in banneton, and pinch the perimeters of the dough into the center to hold the shape even more, called stitching.) The dough will now go through its final rise. You can do this on the counter, which will take about 1 1/2 to 2 hours at 70 degrees F for the dough to puff up and be jiggly. It will not double. OR you can do the final rise overnight in the refrigerator, with the banneton covered in a plastic bag or with a very damp cloth. You need this for holding moisture in., Time to bake. Preheat your oven to 475 degrees F, with your dutch oven preheating inside the oven. When the oven is preheated, flip your dough out gently onto parchment paper and score your dough. If you did the final rise in the refrigerator, take it straight from fridge to scoring. You should score it cold, and DO NOT need to let it come to room temp., Then put scored dough into the dutch oven on the parchment, and put cover on. Turn oven down to 450 degrees F and slide dutch oven in. Bake for 20 minutes, then remove cover., Turn heat down to 430 degrees F, and bake for 20 to 25 more minutes, until crust is golden brown and crackly.

It wont completely cover the grains, rather, just moisten them. Leave out at room temperature overnight., For the Dough:, Coat the inside of a large bowl and a 9x5"" loaf pan with olive oil. Set aside., Mix the milk and apple cider vinegar together. Whisk vigorously. Set aside., In the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, add both flours, sugar, salt, and yeast. Mix for 10 seconds. With the mixer off, add the soaker, brown rice, syrup, milk mixture, and water. Mix on speed 4 just until the dough comes together, and is hydrated. A chunky ball should form (if there's still some dry bits in the bottom of the mixer, add a tablespoon of water and mix just until a dough forms). Switch to the dough hook. Mix on speed 4 for 9-10 minutes, stopping occasionally to push the dough back down into the bowl. If the dough feels a bit too dry, add 1 tablespoon of water, if too wet, a few pinches of flour (don't worry, this dough is very forgiving).*If kneading by hand, knead for about 12-13 minutes on a lightly floured work surface.The dough is ready to remove from the mixer when it is more tacky, than sticky and registers 77-81 Fahrenheit (25-27 Celsius) on a thermometer (very important temperature). Finish the dough by kneading it on a lightly floured work surface for 1-2 minutes. Sprinkle with a bit of flour if needed., Tuck the dough into a ball making sure the surface is taught. Transfer the dough to the oiled bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or moist doubled up tea towels.Set a timer for 90 minutes to allow the dough to ferment. It should double in size. If the dough is rising too fast, pop it in the fridge to cool it down for 10-15 minutes or set it in a cooler area of the house. It may take longer to rise, but we don't want it to rise too fast, as this is where flavor development occurs. The goal is not for it to rise in 90 minutes. The goal is for the dough to double in size. 90 minutes is only a guide., To shape the dough, remove the dough from the bowl and place it on a lightly floured work surface. Use the illustrations in the blog post as a guide to shape the dough. Press the dough into a rough rectangle about 3/4 inches thick, 6 inches wide and 8-10 inches long. Fold the dough lengthwise 2/3 over onto itself and crease it firmly using the pinky side of your hand. Fold the 1/3 piece left towards the crease and pinch the seam closed. Fold in the ends, coming in about an 1 inch and pinch the seam closed. Turn the bread over and rock it back and fourth a bit and gently fluff the ends in a bit. Gently place the loaf, seam side down into the prepared loaf pan. Lightly spray or brush with water and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of rolled oats over the top. Cover with plastic wrap or moistened doubled up tea towels. Set the timer for 90 minutes and proof until the dough nearly doubles in size. I've had this dough take longer and much shorter to rise than 90 minutes (It's also risen right on time before too!). The amount of time will vary depending on the temperature of its surroundings. Just keep an eye on it and look for it to almost double in size or rise about 1 1/4 inches above the lip of the pan at the center. *Tip: if the dough is sloooow, you can pop it into a turned off oven with the light on to speed this along., Preheat the oven to 350 Fahrenheit (176 Celsius) with the oven rack in the center. Bake for 20 minutes, rotate the pan and continue baking for another 30-40 minutes or until the bread reaches an internal temperature of 185 -190 Fahrenheit (85-87 Celsius), and is golden brown. Tent with foil if needed at about 30 minutes if the bread is getting too dark., Turn the bread out of the loaf pan and onto a cooling rack. Allow to cool completely, for a least 2 hours. If the bread is cut before it's cool it will be gummy inside., Store cut side down on a cutting board, for a few hours of storage. For longer storage, store in a plastic bag for up to 2 days.

(I use a Danish dough whisk by hand.), Add whole wheat flour and all seeds, then add white flour. (This dough is going to be a little stickier than my sourdough sandwich bread recipe, because the seeds and whole wheat take time to soak up all the liquid. It should still be a nice formed dough, just not as smooth.), Mix it together just enough for there to be no dry flour, then cover and let rest 30 minutes. (This lets the whole wheat soak up the liquid and gives you a taller loaf with a softer inside crumb.), Now knead it together 15-20 folds, right there in the bowl. It'll still be a little stickier because the seeds take longer to hydrate, but still a nice workable dough, not sloppy at all., Now, choose your path for first rise depending on your schedule and weather. Warmth speeds up sourdough, cold slows it. This is all on counter unless specified., Winter Rising, Let the dough sit for 12-18 hours., Shape it and allow for a second rise of 2-3 hours.

(This is called a preshape/bench rest and makes your loaves taller!), Prepare your loaf pan by lining with parchment or greasing the pan., After the bench rest, flip seam side up, press into a rectangle again but this time roll it up, and tuck sides under to make a tidy loaf, then put into the loaf pan., Let rise for second rise depending on which path you choose. It's not going to be doubled, more like 1 1/2x, noticeably more puffy for sure though., Baking Multigrain Sourdough Bread, Preheat oven to 425°F., Using your sharpest knife, slash the loaf by slicing a one inch deep line down the length of the bread. You can get artistic or just leave it at that.

Dump into a large bowl with the polenta, butter and honey. Pour the boiling water over and let sit, stirring once or twice, until the mixture feels just warm to the touch, about 30 - 45 minutes. (If the water is hotter than this, it could kill the yeast. But don't let the grains sit too long, or they may absorb too much water and throw your ratios off.), Make the dough:, Crumble in the fresh yeast, stir, (if using active dry yeast, let the mixture sit for 10 minutes) then add the flaxseeds, whole wheat flour and salt. Begin adding the white flour 1/4 cup at a time, stirring after each addition. After about 1 1/4 cups the dough should form a rough, sticky mass. (If it is too dry at this point, sprinkle over a bit more water and continue stirring or kneading until it becomes sticky again.) Scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a large plastic bag, and let the mixture sit for 15 - 20 minutes. (This is called autolyse, and it allows the starches in the flour to absorb the water and swell up, and the glutens to begin unfurling and forming straight lines. All of this makes the dough smoother and easier to knead, allowing you to add less flour and resulting in a wetter dough, which is what we want here.), Uncover the bowl and scrape the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough, dusting your hands and surface with just enough flour to keep it from sticking, for about 10 minutes. The dough should feel smoother by the end, and should be a bit tacky but not sticking to things., Round the dough into a boule and place in a large bowl coated lightly with oil. Turn to coat the dough with oil and leave the boule smooth side up. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and leave to rise until doubled in bulk, 1 - 2 hours., Shape the loaf:, Grease an 8x4"" or 9x5"" loaf pan with butter. Turn the dough out onto a surface dusted very lightly with a bit of flour. (A plastic scraper works wonderfully for this.) Pat the dough into a rectangle roughly 8x14"", with a skinny side facing you. Roll the dough up snugly, cinnamon bun-style,and pinch the seam shut. Tuck the ends under the loafand roll the log a few times, seam side down, to smooth it out. Place the log, seam side down, in the greased pan, and put the whole shebang into a large plastic vegetable bag (or small garbage bag). Tie the end of the bag shut, leaving it inflated to give the loaf room to expand., Let the loaf rise until doubled in bulk and 2"" above the rim of the pan, 45 - 60 minutes. Meanwhile..., Prepare the oven:, Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 400º. If you have a baking stone, put that on the rack. Place a metal or cast iron pan that you don't care about on the floor of the oven. You will put ice cubes in it to steam the oven, and it will become rusted and nasty., Bake the bread:, Remove the bag. Fill a 1/2 cup measure with ice cubes. Open the oven and quickly but gently place the loaf pan on the baking stone, and toss the ice cubes into the pan on the floor of the oven. Close the door and don't open it again for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, reduce the oven to 350º. Rotate the pan and bake the loaf for 30 - 40 more minutes, for a total baking time of 50 - 60 minutes. A thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf should register 195 - 200º. Optionally, for an extra-crisp crust, remove the loaf from the pan after 45 minutes and finish baking directly on the stone., Remove the loaf from the pan and let cool completely before cutting (the internal steam is continuing to cook the interior of the bread) 1 - 2 hours., Store the bread in a plastic bag or other airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.","[('millet', 0.25, 'cup'), ('steel cut oats', 0.25, 'cup'), ('polenta', 0.25, 'cup'), ('butter', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('honey', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('water', 1.5, 'cups'), ('yeast', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('flaxseeds', 0.25, 'cup'), ('wheat bread flour', 0.5, 'cup'), ('salt', 1.75, 'teaspoons'), ('white bread flour', 2.0, 'cups')]"

Gently stir to mix., Allow the yeast to sit in a warm place for about 15 minutes, until it's activated and becomes frothy. This could take longer if your yeast was in the freezer. If the yeast doesn't activate (no frothy bubbles), then your yeast is likely too old and you will need it replaced with fresh yeast., Once the yeast is activated, you’re ready to make the bread dough., Bread loaf, To the proofed yeast mixture, add the flour, warm water, salt, honey, citric acid and melted butter., Using a dough whisk or a spatula, mix the ingredients to form a rough dough., Place the bowl in the mixer with a kneading hook attached, and knead the dough on low speed for about 2 - 5 minutes, until the dough comes together to form a ball., Increase the speed by 1 or 2 levels (speed 3 or 4 in a kitchen aid mixer) and knead the dough for a further 12 - 15 minutes until it's smooth and elastic., While the dough is kneading, check on it every few minutes to make sure it’s kneading well, and is not too dry or too wet. The dough is going to be very sticky and wet at the beginning, and become smoother as it's kneaded., To check if the dough has the right consistency after about 10 minutes of kneading - Increase the speed of the mixer to about 5 or 6 just for a minute or two. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, then it’s too wet, so add a little extra flour (a dusting at a time), to get the right texture. If the dough is still tacky but is coming off the sides (mostly), and only sticking to the bottom of the bowl, then it's at the right consistency. When you stop the mixer and lift the kneading hook from the bowl, and the dough isn’t sticking to the bottom of the bowl, then the dough might be too dry. You may need to add a little extra water (just ½ tsp at a time), to get the right consistency. The dough should be smooth, a little soft and tacky to the touch., Once the dough is kneaded, remove the dough hook and fold the dough over a few times by hand, to get a smooth ball. Then place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough proof for about 1 hour until it has at least doubled in size., While the dough is proofing, prepare the bread loaf pans. Butter 1 - 9 x 5 inch loaf pan for a very large loaf, or 2 - 8.5 x 4.5 inch loaf pans for smaller loaves, and set aside until the dough is ready., Turn the proofed dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Slightly flatten is with your hands. If making two smaller loaves, halve the dough with a sharp knife or bench scraper. (For more accurately halved dough, weigh the dough and then split it evenly by weight.) Place one portion of the dough back in the bowl and place it in the fridge while you shape the first portion., Gently press the dough into an evenly thick rectangle. The short side of this rectangle should be roughly about 8 - 8.5 inches (i.e. slightly shorter than the length of your bread loaf pan)., Next, tightly roll up the short side, along the length of the dough rectangle. Make sure to pinch / press the edge of the dough as you go, while rolling it up (read the post and see pictures for more details)., Once the dough is rolled up, pinch the seams to seal it, and tuck in the two sides and pinch these seams as well. Make sure all the seams are on one side (this will be the bottom) and the other side is smooth and seam-free (this will be the top)., Transfer this into the prepared loaf pan, seam side down, and press the dough into the pan. Make sure it’s evenly pressed into the bottom of the pan. Loosely cover the loaf pan with plastic wrap and let it proof again in a warm place, for about 45 minutes - 1 hour. The dough should double in size inside the loaf pan / pans., Repeat with the second portion of dough (if making two smaller loaves)., To check if it has proofed enough, gently press the top of the dough with your finger to leave an indentation that is about ½ cm deep. If proofed properly, this indentation should remain, or only bounce back slightly. If it bounces back almost completely, then it's underproofed. (Read the post and see pictures for more details.), Preheat the oven (conventional oven) to 375°F / 190°C, during the last 30 minutes of the second proofing time. It’s best for the oven to be preheated to the right temperature for at least 20 minutes before baking the bread., When the bread loaf is ready and the oven has preheated, place the loaf pans in the middle of the oven, and bake for 35 - 45 minutes. Make sure there is at least 2 inches of space between the pans to allow for proper air circulation. The bread is done when it sounds hollow when tapped on top, OR when the internal temperature reaches 195°F / 91°C., Remove the pans from the oven and keep in a warm place (away from drafts) to cool. After about 10 minutes, remove the bread from the pans and keep it on a wire rack to cool down completely. The bread is now ready to be served., Optional - brush melted butter on top while it's hot to add more buttery flavor., Keep the loaf (or loaves) in a bread box at room temperature for up to 4 - 5 days, or slice and keep in the freezer for up to 1 month.","[('active dry yeast', 7.0, 'g'), ('water', 1.0, 'cup'), ('honey', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('ap flour', 19.5, 'ounces'), ('water', 0.5, 'cup'), ('sea salt', 1.25, 'tsp'), ('honey', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('citric acid', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('unsalted butter', 2.0, 'tbsp')]"

It is normal for your sponge to “deflate” as you mix this together. Slowly incorporate the remaining flour in ½ cup increments.

Knead for 10 minutes., If you are kneading by hand: when the dough mixture becomes more difficult to stir and work with in the bowl (usually at about 5 – 5 ½ cups). I like to work in the rest of the flour by hand. Place the dough on a clean, floured work surface. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and begin to knead. The quicker you work your hands, the less likely they are to stick. I like to knead by pulling in the corners of the dough with my fingers and then pressing down with heel of my hand, quickly and gently over and over again. While doing so, I continue to slowly add additional spoonfuls of flour. This will take about 10 minutes depending on how fast you knead. You know the dough is ready when it’s not too sticky, and very soft., After kneading, round out the dough into a circle; doesn’t have to be perfect. Grease or flour the bottom of a bowl, place dough in bowl, and cover. Let rise about 25-30 minutes, or until doubled in size., Forming the Loaves, Grease two 9x5 inch pans. Punch down the risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. Gently work your dough into a thick rectangle (about 12x8)and fold into thirds. Roll it up, pinch the seams together, and gently throw your loaf on the work surface to release any last air bubbles. (There are many ways to form a loaf. Do what's comfortable and what works for you.), Place loaves in prepared pans, cover, and let rise again for about 25 minutes, or until thepeak of the loaf is just arching over the rim of the pan., While dough rises, preheat oven to 350°(I like 375°F for high altitude)., Bake, Bake for about 25 minutes or until bottoms are golden brown.

Then with your hand until a shaggy dough is formed, just enough so that flour is not visible., Cover with a damp cloth and let sit for 30 minutes., Once rested, add salt to top of dough and liberally knead the dough for two minute. Then perform your 1st of stretch and folds. Let rest for 30 minutes., Then perform your 2nd set. Let rest for 30 minutes. Then perform your 3rd set. Let rest for 30 minutes. Then perform your 4th and final set. 4 sets of stretch and folds, 30 minutes apart. Here is a video of how to do a stretch and fold. It is easy!, After those stretch and folds are completed, you will let the dough finish its bulk ferment. This means letting the dough rise on the counter for around 6-7ish hours total (from 1st set of stretch and folds) if your house is around 72 degrees. It will take more time if it is cooler, or less time if it warmer. Your dough is finished proofing when: it has risen about 75% (not quite doubled in size), has a glossy top and is puffy, with a bubble or two around the edges of the bowl/bucket. It should jiggle a bit as well when you shake it. These are the signs to look for, rather than going off of time. Time is a general notation because the temperature of water you used and air temperature will be different for everyone., Now you'll gently move the dough out of the bowl onto a floured work surface. Let the dough rest there for 10-15 minutes., Then, shape the dough. You can watch the video below to learn how to shape it into a round boule., Once shaped, use a bench scraper to put the dough into a banneton (proofing basket) that has been liberally dusted with rice flour, seam side of the dough facing up (so the top of the dough is what is touching the bottom of banneton) when it is placed in banneton., Cover with a damp cloth, and let rise for a final time, on the counter. This will take about 2 hours, if your house is around 70 degrees. OR you can put the banneton with dough, in a plastic bag or covered with a shower cap (this ensures the dough will not dry out) in the refrigerator and let the final rise happen overnight. The dough can be in the refrigerator for 10-12 hours at this stage., Once your dough has gone through its final rise and has risen slightly and is puffy on top, preheat your oven with dutch oven in it to 450 degrees F. You can test to see if your dough is ready by doing gently pressing a floured thumb into the dough. If it indents and gradually releases, but still holds a finger shape, you're ready! If you press your finger in and the indent doesn't move or release, that means it is overproofed (but still bake it!). If your fingerprint jumps right back up to flat, your dough is underproofed (but still bake it!). Let it ferment in half hour more increments, until ready., Wait until oven is preheated, then place parchment over the top of your dough and flip over, so that the seam side is now on the parchment paper and you are able to score the top of the dough., Score the dough with a bread lame, making sure to go at least 1/2 inch deep in a few spots so that dough can release gases. Otherwise your bread will not rise., Place dough on parchment paper into a dutch oven, and put cover on it. Bake for 20 minutes, covered at 450 degrees F.

The first is to obtain an established starter from a friend, feed it, and use it for baking. Another method is to purchase a dehydrated starter from a culture starter company and follow the directions for rehydrating, feeding, and baking with the starter., If you're more of a do-it-yourselfer like me, then you may want to make your own. Honestly, you won't believe how easy this is. All you need is flour, water, a half-gallon jar, and a wooden spoon. Here's how I do it:, Day 1: Combine 1 cup wheat flour with 3/4 cup warm water. Cover with towel or coffee filter and secure with rubber band or canning ring. Place in a warm place., Day 2: Add 1 cup freshly ground wheat flour and 3/4 cup warm water. Ditto above., Days 3-5: Repeat., The time it takes the starter to become active will probably depend on what yeast beasts you have hanging around in your home. To maintain your starter simply feed it every day and keep in a warm place, or refrigerate and feed just once per week. I also like to pour the starter into a bowl once a week and beat some air into it with a wooden spoon., Make Your Sponge The Night Before:, I have found that giving the yeast time to activate without added ingredients results in a better bread. For this step you will need a large, non-reactive bowl, a wooden spoon, and the following ingredients:, Combine all ingredients with 3.5 cups warm water and beat well to incorporate air. It should be the consistency of pancake batter. Cover with a damp towel and place in a warm place, like next to a heater or in a warm oven., Prepare Dough to Rise & Bake:, In the morning, get out your starter which should look active with bubbles and a bit of rising action. Give it a good stir and then remove 1 cup to set aside for your next batch of bread. To this you will add:, Add the butter/coconut oil to starter and fold in along with sea salt. Now add the flour one cup at a time, while mixing, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, but is still a little sticky. Remove dough and place on a well-floured surface. Now knead the dough for about 10 minutes or until smooth, adding more flour to work surface as needed., Butter two bread pans and set aside. Now cut your dough in half and form two loaves. Place loaves in bread pans, give them a few diagonal slits with a sharp knife, cover with a damp towel (tea towel, not terrycloth), and place in a warm spot. This time of year I place them inside of my oven and turn it on warm every time I walk past., At this point you wait until the loaves have risen past the top of the pan. Depending on how active your starter is this could take a couple hours or you may be baking bread around dinner time. This is something you have to make peace with when you bake with sourdough bread., Once the loaves have risen to your liking you will bake them in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes to an hour, or until the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when you thump it. Remove loaves from pans and place on a cooling rack to cool completely before slicing.","[('wheat flour', 1.0, 'cup'), ('wheat flour', 1.0, 'cup'), ('wheat flour', 4.0, 'cups'), ('sourdough starter', 2.0, 'cups'), ('melted butter', 0.5, 'cup'), ('sea salt', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('whole wheat flour', 5.0, 'cups')]"

Or, if you do not own a stand mixer, a regular large mixing bowl. Heat the milk on the stove or in the microwave until warm to touch, about 110°F (43°C). Pour warm milk on top of yeast/sugar. Whisk gently to combine, then loosely cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow to sit for 5-10 minutes. The mixture will be frothy after 5-10 minutes., If you do not have a mixer, you can mix the dough together with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in this step, Add the butter, egg, flour, salt, garlic powder, and rosemary. Beat on low speed for 3 minutes. Dough will be soft., Knead the dough:, Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if using the paddle) and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st Rise, Shape the kneaded dough into a ball. Place the dough in a greased bowl (I use nonstick spray to grease) and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place in a slightly warm environment to rise until doubled in size, around 60-90 minutes. (If desired, use my warm oven trick for rising. See my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), As the dough rises, prepare the filling in the next step and grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan., Make the filling, In a medium bowl, mix the soft butter, rosemary, parsley, garlic, and salt together. If the butter is soft enough, you can just mix it all together with a spoon or fork. You can use an electric mixer if that’s easier too. Cover tightly and set aside until ready to use. (Don’t refrigerate unless making well in advance. It’s easiest to spread on the dough when at room temperature. If refrigerated, let it come to room temperature before spreading on dough pieces.), Assemble the bread:, Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface. Divide it into 12 equal pieces, each about 1/4 cup of dough and a little larger than a golf ball. Using lightly floured hands, flatten each into a circle that’s about 4 inches in diameter. The circle doesn’t have to be perfectly round. I do not use a rolling pan to flatten, but you certainly can if you want. Spread 1-2 teaspoons of filling mixture onto each. Sprinkle each with 1 Tablespoon of cheese. Fold circles in half and line in prepared baking pan, round side up.

If you find the top of the loaf is browning too quickly, tent with aluminum foil. (Don’t be alarmed if there’s melted butter around the sides of the bread as it bakes, it will seep into the bread before it finishes.) Remove from the oven and place the pan on a wire rack. If desired, brush with melted butter for topping and sprinkle with sea salt., Cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then remove from the pan and serve warm., Cover and store leftovers at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Add the flour and salt. Squish everything together with your hands until all of the flour is absorbed. The dough will be dry and shaggy. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, reusable wrap or a clean, very damp kitchen towel. Let rest (autolyse) for 30 minutes or up to 1 hour, if preferred., After the dough has rested, work the dough in the bowl into a rough ball, about 15 seconds., Bulk Rise, Now the dough needs to rise., Cover the bowl with wrap or a very damp kitchen cloth. Let rest in a warm spot to rise. The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense and has doubled in size. This can take anywhere from 3-12 hours depending on the temperature of your ingredients, the potency of your starter and surrounding environment. For example, in the summer rise times can take anywhere between 2-4 hours @ 85º F/ 29º C whereas in the winter, the dough will take about 10-12 hours @ 68º F/ 20º C., Optional Step: Stretch & Fold the Dough, During bulk rise, you have the option to perform a series of ‘stretch & folds’ to strengthen the dough. Start 30 minutes into the bulk rise. Gather a portion of the dough, stretch it upwards and then fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl ¼ turn and repeat this process until you have come full circle to complete 1 set. Do this once or twice spaced about an hour apart. Although this step is not mandatory, it will increase the total volume and height of your bread. Click here for a step-by-step video tutorial., Cut & Shape the Dough, Divide your work surface in half; lightly flour one side (for cutting) and leave the other half clean (for shaping)., Remove the dough from the bowl, and place onto the floured section so that it does not stick. You do not need to ‘punch down’ the dough; it will gently deflate as you fold and shape it., Cut the dough in half to make 2 loaves, or leave it whole for a single loaf., To shape, use a bench scraper to move your dough to the non-floured section (if there is any flour present, it will be difficult to shape- brush away any excess). Starting at the top, fold the dough over toward the center. Give it a slight turn, and then fold over the next section of dough. Repeat until you have come full circle., Then flip the dough over and place it seam side down. Using your hands, gently cup the sides of the dough and rotate it, using quarter turns in a circular motion. You can also pull it towards you to even out the shape. Repeat this process until you are happy with its appearance. *See note below., Second Rise, Now the dough needs to rise again, but for a shorter period of time., Coat the bottom of your Dutch oven with cornmeal. Alternatively, use parchment paper to prevent sticking (this is what I do, now). Place the dough inside for a second shorter rise, about 30 minutes to 1 hour and cover with the lid of the pot or a very damp cloth. The dough ready when it is slightly puffy but not double in size., Preheat your oven to 450º F/ 232º C towards the tail end of the second rise., Score the Dough, Right before your bread goes into the oven, make a shallow slash about 2-3 inches long (or more) in the center of the dough. Use a bread lame, sharp pairing or a small serrated steak knife. The cut should be about 1/4-inch deep., Bake the Dough, Place the bread into the oven on the center rack (lid on) and reduce the temperature to 400° F/ 204° C. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the lid, and continue to bake (uncovered) for an additional 40 minutes or until deep, golden brown. Keep in mind that all ovens are different; you might have to make minimal adjustments to these temperatures., You can also take the internal temperature of your bread to double check that it is done. For sourdough, it should read about 205-210º F/ 96-98º C., Remove the bread from the oven, and cool on a wire rack for at least an hour before slicing.

Use the forks to split the dough into two equal pieces (or do not split if using the 9×13-inch pan). Place one piece into one of the prepared pans. Roll the dough ball in the oil to coat it all over, forming a rough ball. Repeat with the remaining piece.

Heat to 110° F for active dry yeast and 120° F if using rapid rise yeast. Stir in all the yeast. Let sit for 10 minutes. Yeast should become a foamy. If it does not foam, it is dead and you need to start over., Transfer the yeast mixture to the stand mixer bowl if kneading by machine and a regular mixing bowl if kneading by hand. Add butter, sugar, salt, and 6 1/2 cups of flour in increments (3 1/4 cups for a half recipe). Stir with a wooden spoon or by hand until the mixture becomes a shaggy dough. Then it’s time to knead., Kneading by stand mixer: Place the bowl onto the stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Start with the mixer on low. After 1 minute of mixing, if the dough does not start to clear the side of the bowl, add a couple tablespoons of flour at a time until it starts to pull away from the sides. Allow the flour to incorporate before adding more. You should need to add the max of one cup. My stand mixer requires dough to be kneaded on low (speed 2). If your stand mixer does not not have the low speed restriction, increase to medium a this point. Knead for 6 to 8 minutes total, or until the dough becomes smooth, elastic, and springs back when poked. If poking leaves a indentation in the dough, it needs more kneading. (See Note ** below.), Kneading by hand: Turn the dough onto a floured work surface. Lightly flour the top of the dough. Gather into an oval mass with the pointy ends at 12 o’clock and 6 o’clock. Fold the 12 o’clock end over to the 6 o’clock end (using a plastic bench scraper would help if the dough is overly sticky). Using the heel of your hand, press on the lower end of the dough with a downward and forward motion. Turn the dough a quarter turn. Fold the 12 o’clock end over to the 6 o’clock end again. Then repeat pressing downward and away from you. Continue to kneading in this manner for 8-10 minutes. As you continue to knead, add a small amount of flour, as needed, if the dough feels too wet and sticky. The max amount you might need to add is 1 cup total. The dough is properly kneaded when it becomes smooth, elastic, and springs back when poked. If poking leaves a indentation in the dough, it needs more kneading. (See Note ** below.), Fermentation (1st rise), Transfer the dough into a generously large greased bowl. Turn the dough around to coat with oil. Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Allow to rest and double in size at room temperature for approximately 1 hour if using rapid rise yeast and 2 hours for active dry yeast., To shape dough:, Gently press punch down dough to release some air. Divide into 2 equal pieces. Working with one piece at a time, press gently to to form a rough rectangle with the short side no wider than 8-inches., Stretch out the corners of one of the short sides to form flaps. Fold them back towards center so that the top edge of the flaps meet vertically at the center line to form a point at the top of the rectangle. The outline of the dough should resemble a shape of a house. Use the heel of your hand to press down the seam to seal., Fold the pointed tip over the seam and press to seal the new seam., Repeat stretching the corners out, folding, sealing (steps 7-8) two more times. You should still have some unrolled dough at this point., Roll the dough log-style onto itself. When you are within an inch or so of the edge, cup your hand over the log while pressing into the bottom edge of the log roll with the heel of your hand to seal the seam. Then roll the log to the edge of the dough., Grease the bottom and sides of two 8.5 x 4.5 x 2.5-inch loaf pans. Place the dough, seam side down in the loaves. Press down gently with your hand to distribute the dough to fill the pan. Cover loosely with a lightly greased plastic wrap. Shape the other half of the dough., See Note*** below for shaping alternative., Proofing (2nd rise):, Proof dough at room temperature until the dough doubles in size and rises about 1-inch over the pans. This takes about 1 hour if using rapid rise yeast and 2 hours if using active dry yeast., Baking:, Preheat the oven to 350° F 10 minutes before the dough is ready to bake., Whisk egg and water in a small bowl. Brush egg wash onto the top of the loaves. Bake on the center rack for 35-45 minutes. Mine are usually done in 35 minutes. The internal temperature should be 190°-200° F., Allow to cool in loaf pans for 5 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack. Brush the top with butter to keep crust soft (optional).

(I fold the right third in towards the center and the left third in towards the center.)Flip the dough and repeat the stretching and folding process on the other side., Return the dough to the bowl, cover, and allow to rise for another hour.Repeat the rest and fold period two more times (for a total of 3 hours).On the third folding, add the herbs, garlic powder and nutritional yeast (if using) by folding it into the dough. Spread the dough slightly and then sprinkle half the herbs, garlic and nutritional yeast across the dough. Fold it like a letter, flip the dough, and spread it out again. Sprinkle the remaining herbs, garlic and yeast over the dough. Fold the dough one more time., Return the dough to the bowl and cover with a fitted lid, damp towel, or with plastic wrap.Do one of the following proofing methods (not both):Proof Refrigerated (Preferred Method): Place the dough in the fridge and proof for at least 8 hours, or up to 2 days (48 hours). If you used a towel (instead of plastic wrap) to cover the bowl, re-dampen the towel occasionally. Proof Unrefrigerated: (Only proof unrefrigerated if your kitchen is around 70°F or cooler). Place the dough out of direct sunlight on your counter and allow it to rise for about 8 hours, more or less, depending on the temperature. Check the bread to see if it's finished proofing by pressing the dough with a lightly floured or oiled knuckle. If the dough springs right back, allow it to keep proofing. If it's slow to spring back, it's ready., Day 2: Finish Proofing + Bake, Dampen a work surface and your hands.Gently turn the dough out onto the work surface. Form the dough into a ball, place it seam-side up, and cover with a damp towel. Allow the dough to rest for about 15 minutes.Next, use dampened hands to roll the dough into a round ball. Place the dough on parchment paper., If you proofed your dough in the fridge: Leave the dough to rise at room temperature until it's no longer cold (about 2½ to 3 hours).If you proofed your dough at room temperature: Leave the dough to rest on the parchment paper while the oven pre-heats, and then you can go ahead and bake., About 30 minutes before you're ready to bake, pre-heat your oven to 480°F. If using a non-enameled pot, place the pot in the oven during the pre-heat.Just before baking, lightly dust the dough with flour, and then use a bread lame or a floured knife to score the bread. (Scoring will give steam an outlet and will prevent the bottom of the loaf from cracking.)Scoring can be as simple as one or two long lines across the top. If desired, you can create a pattern while scoring for a more decorative final loaf., If you pre-heated the Dutch oven, remove it carefully from the oven. Place the parchment paper and dough into the Dutch oven. Lightly spritz the dough with water, and then add the Dutch oven lid. Slide bread into the pre-heated oven.Lower the oven temperature to 450°F.Bake the bread for 45 minutes covered, and then remove the Dutch oven lid and bake uncovered another 10 to 15 minutes, until the center of the loaf is 210°F. If you don't have a digital thermometer, you can try gently knocking on the bottom of the loaf to see if it sounds hollow., Use a spatula, tongs or the edges of the parchment paper to move the bread onto a cooling rack.Wait at least 2 hours before cutting into the loaf. It will be tempting to cut it earlier, but the bread is still baking internally. Cutting early will result in an under-cooked loaf.Store the bread lightly wrapped on the countertop for up to 4 days, or wrap tightly and freeze up to 3 months. I recommend slicing the bread before freezing, so that you can thaw individual slices if desired. Thaw frozen slices by toasting or heating over low heat on a stovetop griddle or pan.","[('sourdough starter', 1.0, 'cup'), ('bread flour', 5.0, 'cups'), ('water', 1.75, 'cups'), ('salt', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('garlic powder', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('dried rosemary', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('nutritional yeast', 0.25, 'cup')]"
