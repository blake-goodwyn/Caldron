Add the kosher salt to the bowl, and 1 cup of the flour. Mix on low, while slowly adding the rest of the flour, until it is fully incorporated. Knead the mixture on low for about 5 minutes. The dough should look sticky, and should just form a loose ball. Remove the dough hook, scraping any dough bits off it.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F., Flour your work surface well. Use a rubber spatula to slowly pour out the dough onto your work surface. Make sure your hands are floured, and gather the dough into a ball, tucking the edges under. Use a bench scraper or sharp knife to cut the dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a smooth ball with your hands, and place on the floured board to rest for 5-10 minutes.

You can use the discard for other recipes or if you have chickens you can feed it to them!, Add 150 g of all-purpose flour and 150 g of lukewarm water to the jar and stir it with a long silicone spatula or another clean kitchen utensil until well combined. It should be the consistency of a thick pancake batter. Loosely place the lid on the jar and let rise in a warm spot for 6-8 hours. I like to put mine on top of my fridge., Dough:, To a large mixing bowl, add 125 g of active starter and 350 g of lukewarm water. Whisk the mixture with a dough whisk until the starter is somewhat dispersed in the water. It doesn't have to be a homogenous mixture., Add 10 g of salt and 500 g of bread flour. Stir with the dough whisk until a shaggy dough forms. Cover the bowl and let it rest for 30 minutes. I like to use a shower cap to cover my bowl and banneton so I don't use a bunch of plastic wrap and they're easier to fit around the bowl., Use a silicone bowl scraper to pull the dough away from the bowl edges. Gently stretch the dough between your hands. Then fold the dough in half, grab the sides with the seams, and stretch it in the opposite direction. Repeat until dough starts to feel tight and resists stretching, about 3-4 times. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 30 minutes., Repeat the stretching, folding, and resting process 3 more times. Cover the dough and let it sit on the counter overnight, about 8-12 hours., Shaping and Baking:, In the morning, shape the dough into your desired shape (boule or batard) with a bench scraper and place it top-down in a floured banneton or cloth-lined bowl. See the recipe post for a photo tutorial on shaping., Seal the bottom edges of the dough ball together. Cover the banneton and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours for a really crispy crust. The sweet spot is around 3-4 hours for this recipe., Place the Dutch oven in a cold oven and preheat it to 500°F. Preheat for at least 1 hour., Place the dough ball, seam side down, on a piece of parchment paper. Score it with a razor blade or bread lame.

Add the flour and salt. Mix to combine, finishing by hand if necessary to form a rough dough. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes., Stretch and fold, After 30 minutes, grab a corner of the dough and pull it up and into the center. Repeat until you’ve performed this series of folds 4 to 5 times with the dough. Let dough rest for another 30 minutes and repeat the stretching and folding action. If you have the time: do this twice more for a total of 4 times in 2 hours. Note: Even if you can only perform one series of stretches and folds, your dough will benefit. So don’t worry if you have to run off shortly after you mix the dough., Bulk Fermentation (first rise), Cover the bowl with a towel and let rise at room temperature, about 8 to 10 hours at 70°F (21°C) or even less if you live in a warm environment. The dough is ready when it has increased by 50% in volume, has a few bubbles on the surface, and jiggles when you move the bowl from side to side. (UPDATE: In the past I have recommended letting the dough rise until it doubles in volume. If you’ve had success with this, continue to let the dough double. Recently, I have been stopping the bulk fermentation when the dough increases by 50% in volume, and I feel I am actually getting better oven spring in the end.) (Note regarding timing: If you are using 100 g of starter, the bulk fermentation may take less than 8 to 10 hours. If you live in a warm, humid environment, the bulk fermentation may take even less time. In the late spring/early summer, for example, my kitchen is 78ºF and the bulk fermentation takes 6 hours. It is best to rely on visual cues (increase in volume by roughly 50%) as opposed to time to determine when the bulk fermentation is done. A straight-sided vessel makes monitoring the bulk fermentation especially easy because it allows you to see when your dough has truly increased in volume by 50%.), Shape (See notes above), Coax the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Gently shape it into a round: fold the top down to the center, turn the dough, fold the top down to the center, turn the dough; repeat until you’ve come full circle. If you have a bench scraper, use it to push and pull the dough to create tension., Rest, Let the dough rest seam side up rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, line an 8-inch (20-cm) bowl or proofing basket with a towel (flour sack towels are ideal) and dust with flour (preferably rice flour, which doesn’t burn the way all-purpose flour does). Using a bench scraper or your hands, shape it again as described in step 4. Place the round into your lined bowl, seam side up., Proof (second rise), Cover the dough and refrigerate for 1 hour or for as long as 48 hours. (Note: I prefer to let this dough proof for at least 24 hours prior to baking. See video for the difference in the crumb of a loaf that has proofed for 6 hours vs one that has proofed for 24 hours. If you choose to proof the dough in the fridge for an extended period of time, you may want to tuck it into a loosely tied bag — produce bags from the grocery store are great for this purpose — to ensure the dough does not dry out. The original recipe calls for a 1-hour rise, and if you have had success doing that, by all means, keep doing it.), Place a Dutch oven in your oven, and preheat your oven to 550°F (290°C). Cut a piece of parchment to fit the size of your baking pot., Score, Place the parchment over the dough and invert the bowl to release. Using the tip of a small knife or a razor blade, score the dough however you wish — a simple “X” is nice. Use the parchment to carefully transfer the dough into the preheated baking pot., Bake, Lower the oven to temperature to 450ºF (230ºC). Carefully cover the pot. Bake the dough for 30 minutes, covered. Remove the lid, lower the temperature to 400ºF (200ºC) and continue to bake for 10 – 15 minutes more. If necessary, lift the loaf out of the pot, and bake directly on the oven rack for the last 5 to 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour before slicing., This loaf will stay fresh up to 3 days stored at room temperature in an airtight plastic bag or container. It freezes beautifully, too.","[('starter', 100.0, 'g'), ('water', 375.0, 'g'), ('flour', 500.0, 'g'), ('salt', 9.0, 'g')]"

Then perform your 4th and final set. 4 sets of stretch and folds, 30 minutes apart. Here is a video of how to do a stretch and fold. It is easy!, After those stretch and folds are completed, you will let the dough finish its bulk ferment. This means letting the dough rise on the counter for around 6-7ish hours total (from 1st set of stretch and folds) if your house is around 72 degrees. It will take more time if it is cooler, or less time if it warmer. Your dough is finished proofing when: it has risen about 75% (not quite doubled in size), has a glossy top and is puffy, with a bubble or two around the edges of the bowl/bucket. It should jiggle a bit as well when you shake it. These are the signs to look for, rather than going off of time. Time is a general notation because the temperature of water you used and air temperature will be different for everyone., Now you'll gently move the dough out of the bowl onto a floured work surface. Let the dough rest there for 10-15 minutes., Then, shape the dough. You can watch the video below to learn how to shape it into a round boule., Once shaped, use a bench scraper to put the dough into a banneton (proofing basket) that has been liberally dusted with rice flour, seam side of the dough facing up (so the top of the dough is what is touching the bottom of banneton) when it is placed in banneton., Cover with a damp cloth, and let rise for a final time, on the counter. This will take about 2 hours, if your house is around 70 degrees. OR you can put the banneton with dough, in a plastic bag or covered with a shower cap (this ensures the dough will not dry out) in the refrigerator and let the final rise happen overnight. The dough can be in the refrigerator for 10-12 hours at this stage., Once your dough has gone through its final rise and has risen slightly and is puffy on top, preheat your oven with dutch oven in it to 450 degrees F. You can test to see if your dough is ready by doing gently pressing a floured thumb into the dough. If it indents and gradually releases, but still holds a finger shape, you're ready! If you press your finger in and the indent doesn't move or release, that means it is overproofed (but still bake it!). If your fingerprint jumps right back up to flat, your dough is underproofed (but still bake it!). Let it ferment in half hour more increments, until ready., Wait until oven is preheated, then place parchment over the top of your dough and flip over, so that the seam side is now on the parchment paper and you are able to score the top of the dough., Score the dough with a bread lame, making sure to go at least 1/2 inch deep in a few spots so that dough can release gases. Otherwise your bread will not rise., Place dough on parchment paper into a dutch oven, and put cover on it. Bake for 20 minutes, covered at 450 degrees F.

Divide it into two even pieces (the dough makes about 850g of dough so divide it into two 425g pieces)., Shape each piece into a ball using a bench scraper and using the counter to create tension. Cover the pieces of bread dough with a clean tea towel and leave to rest for about 10 minutes., Working with one piece of dough at a time, shape the dough into a loaf shape - turn the dough over so the 'good' side is facing down., Flatten the dough out using your hands into a rectangle about the width that your tin is long. For a 1lb loaf pan, this is about 20cm x 15cm (8x6""). Fold over a little of the short edges to form a rough square shape (this does not have to be exact). This helps to give you nice clean ends on your bread., Fold the top third of the dough down, and press with your fingers so that it sticks to the dough underneath - you want to form a gentle seal. Roll the rest of the dough down toward you as tightly as you can. Pull the sausage of bread against the counter to help seal the seam and make sure that the ends are nicely tucked in., Place the dough into the loaf pan carefully, seam side down. It will not completely touch the ends of the pan., Repeat the shaping process with the second piece of dough to form a second loaf., Cover the pans with plastic wrap or a clean tea towel and place in a warm spot until the dough has doubled in size and is nearing the top edge of the pan, about one hour depending on the temperature of your kitchen. To check the rise on the dough, lightly press it with a floured finger - if it is fully risen it will leave an indentation that slowly springs back. If you have started with a cold dough, this step will take 2-3 hours as you need to account for the dough warming up., While the loaves are rising, preheat the oven to 180°c / 350°f. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven., When the loaves are risen, brush the surface of the dough with egg wash., Bake the white bread loaves for 25 to 30 minutes, until deeply golden brown.

I highly recommend reducing the hydration in this recipe if you are new to sourdough baking. This is a high hydration dough and can be challenging to work with (and build strength in) if you're not an experienced baker. If you're looking for an easier to handle dough, I recommend reducing the water to 310 to 330 grams total. If you're working with a lower hydration, you may be able to get away with just 3 to 4 sets of stretch and folds, or even less. Follow the dough's lead!, IMPORTANT NOTE: I do not prepare an off-shoot levain for my sourdough baking, as this baking timeline and method works well for my schedule, as well as my starter's feeding schedule. This choice is up to you and can be adapted/tweaked to fix your schedule, but please plan accordingly. Keep in mind that you'll need to account for the starter quantity in the recipe (90 grams), as well as the normal quantity needed to continue to maintain and feed your starter., Autolyse: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 350 grams unbleached bread flour and 90 grams whole wheat flour. Add 350 grams (90°F/32°C) filtered water and mix with your hands until thoroughly combined and no dry bits are visible. Cover with a clean shower cap or plastic wrap, and rest at 80°F/26°C for 1 hour or up to 2 hours. This step hydrates the flours and helps build dough structure., Add Starter and Rest: While this test isn't fool-proof, your sourdough starter should pass the 'float test' when it's ready. Place a tiny spoonful of your ripe starter in a jar of water, it should float to the top. If it sinks, give it more time (15 to 20 minutes) and test again. Add 90 grams ripe sourdough starter and spread it over the autolyse mixture. Use your fingertips to spread the starter over the autolyse mixture. Fold the edges of the dough into the center to fully incorporate the starter. Use your thumb and fingers to pinch the dough (pincer method) repeatedly until the starter is well incorporated. Don’t be delicate. You want to work quickly, but fully incorporate the mixture. Cover and rest at 80°F/26°C for 30 minutes., Add Salt and Rest: Sprinkle 9 grams salt over the surface of the dough. Use your thumb and fingers to pinch and incorporate the salt thoroughly (you shouldn't feel any granules at the end of mixing) into the dough. Depending on the coarseness of your salt, this might take a couple minutes. Be thorough. Cover and rest at 80°F/26°C for 15 minutes. Important Note and Tip: If you’re struggling with higher hydration doughs and dough strength, there are two additional mixing methods that you can try: slap and fold or the Rubaud method. Please see the full video included in this post for visual demonstration., Bulk Fermentation: We will preform a total of 6 sets of stretch and folds (see article above for further instruction) in the first two hours of bulk fermentation. The first three will take place in 15-minute intervals. The remaining three will occur in 30-minute intervals. Covering and rest the dough at 80°F/26°C between each set. The dough will not rise much during the stretch and fold period, but it should get considerably stronger. Dip your hands in water (to prevent sticking) before each fold. I like to rub my hands together to avoid incorporating much more water, as this is already a high hydration dough. How to Preform a Stretch and Fold: Grab the top portion of the dough with both hands. Gently pull and stretch it upwards (without tearing) and fold over the opposite edge. Rotate the bowl 180 degrees and repeat from the other side. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat once again on both sides. This entire process is one stretch and fold set. After performing the stretch and folds, I like to gently lift the dough to round it nicely in the bowl (see video). *If your dough is developing quickly, you can reduce the total number of stretch and folds to 3 or 4 sets, 30 minutes apart., Bulk Fermentation (continued): Allow the dough to rest, covered at 80°F/26°C, for an additional 1.5 - 2 hours after the last stretch and fold - watch it carefully. Generally, I like to end bulk fermentation when the dough is just under double in size. This has produced good results for me and this guideline works well for this specific sourdough process and timeline. The total bulk fermentation time will vary tremendously based on your ambient kitchen temperature, dough temperature (FDT), flour type, and several other factors, so watch it carefully. Judging the right point to end bulk fermentation and move to the pre-shape period requires practice and trial-and-error. At the end of bulk fermentation, the dough should be well aerated and there will be many gas bubbles on surface, as well as on the edges of the bowl (see video). The dough should be slightly rounded on the edges of the bowl. If the dough is flat, you most likely didn’t build enough strength during mixing, stretch and folds, or bulk., Pre-Shape: Transfer the dough, without degassing, onto a clean countertop. It will be sticky. Use a bench knife to gently shape the dough into a round, pulling it gently towards you on the countertop in a circle to create some tension on the skin of the dough. As you do this, you’ll notice that the dough comes into a shape and starts to feel bouncy (see video). The key is to do this as quickly and gently as possible. Rest the dough, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it has relaxed slightly for the final shaping. Pre-shaping gives the dough some extra tension and strength (and is particularly important if you are doubling the recipe and preparing two loaves, as you'll need to divide it prior). Allowing it to rest allows the gluten to relax slightly before preforming the final shape., Final Shape: Dust a 9-inch round or 10 or 11-inch oval banneton basket with rice flour (be extra liberal if you are not using a cloth or linen liner). Dust the surface of the dough lightly with bread flour. Use a bench knife to gently lift and flip it flour side down onto your countertop. Depending on your preference, banneton, or baking vessel, shape the dough into a round or batard. *Tip: Please watch the video above for visuals on how to shape a batard (oval loaf) or my latest video on how to shape rounds (boules) and bake in a Dutch oven. After shaping, gently pick up the shaped dough, flip, and transfer into your floured banneton, with the seam side facing up. Drape a kitchen linen over the banneton and place the banneton in a plastic bag (*I use a clean plastic produce bag). Seal with a clip and allow the dough to rest at room temperature for 10 minutes., Final Proof: Place covered banneton basket in the refrigerator and retard dough for 15-16 hours at 38°F/3°C. This slow and cold fermentation stage helps develop flavor and improves the final crust texture., Preheat the Oven: Preheat your Challenger Pan, Dutch Oven, or combo cooker (with lid on) in a 500°F/260°C oven for at least 1 hour., Poke Test for Proofing: Once the oven and baking vessel have preheated for an hour, remove the banneton from the fridge and uncover. Test the dough for proper proofing by lightly flouring one small section (while the dough is still in the banneton). Press your finger lightly into the dough. A properly proofed dough should very SLOWLY spring back and still leave a light indentation. That is a sign of a well proofed dough that is ready to be baked. If it springs back quickly and completely, it is under-proofed (return to the fridge, covered, for an additional hour or so). If the dough compresses and doesn’t spring back at all, it is over-proofed. Unfortunately at that point, it’s hard to make up for in that stage of the process - but it will still taste delicious!, Transfer and Bake: If you are using a Challenger Pan or combo cooker, you can skip parchment and carefully invert the basket directly into the preheated base before scoring. If you are using a traditional Dutch oven, please watch this video for visuals: Place a large piece of parchment over the banneton, then top with a thin cutting board. Invert and flip carefully, so that the banneton is upside down, setting it down onto your countertop. The dough should release, right side up, from the banneton onto the parchment. Trim any excess parchment paper, creating two handles on both ends for lifting the dough. Use a bread lame to score the dough (1/2-inch deep), carefully transfer into the preheated pan, cover tightly with the lid, and place in the oven. Bake covered at 500°F/260°C for 25 minutes., Remove the lid. The dough should have risen and expanded considerably, and the crust should be set, but only lightly golden in color., Reduce the oven temperature to 475°F/240°C (*note: if your oven runs hot or your loaves are browning too quickly, reduce the temperature to 450°F/232°C) and continue to bake uncovered for an additional 15-25 minutes or longer until the crust is deep golden and caramelized. I like to rotate the pan several times during this final stage to ensure even browning., Carefully remove the bread from the pan and transfer to a cooling rack. Cool completely before slicing. This will take several hours. Slicing into warm bread will result in a gummier texture and cause the bread to stale faster.

Set aside for five minutes., Add oil and honey and stir to combine., Beat 4 whole eggs plus 2 egg yolks in a separate bowl (discard or save the leftover egg whites for another purpose)., Add the eggs and salt to the liquid mixture and stir to combine completely., Kneading the dough with a stand mixer, Add 930g of the flour to the bowl of the mixer, then add the liquid mixture to the flour. Reserve the remaining 70g flour. Attach the dough hook and lock the mixer head in the down position. Start the mixer on its lowest speed to combine the ingredients., Once all the flour has been incorporated, increase the mixer speed to medium-low to knead and run it for about 7-8 minutes. If you see a lot of dough sticking to the sides, add in 1 tbsp of the reserved flour and let it become fully incorporated. You may need to do this 3 or 4 more times during this step., After 8 minutes, stop the mixer and use a flexible dough scraper (silicone spatula is fine too) to scrape down the sides of the bowl. The dough should be tacky but not impossibly sticky at this point; if it is impossibly sticky (i.e., you can't rub your hands together and get the dough completely off your fingers), add another tbsp of the reserved flour to the bowl and knead another minute or two., Test the dough strength with the windowpane test: tear off a chunk of dough approximately 2 tbsp in size. Hold the piece of dough up to a window or light, and, using your fingers, pinch and stretch the dough into as thin and flat a shape as you can. If you can stretch the dough so that light comes through the dough without the dough tearing, the dough is ready for its first rise. If the windowpane tears, return the dough to the ball and knead for another minute or two and test again. Note: the dough probably doesn't need any more flour at this point, just more kneading., Depending on the size of your mixer, you may find as the dough nears completion, it may start creeping over the top of the dough hook. If that's the case, it's best to pull it out of the mixer and complete by hand. Use the dough scraper to release the dough from the bowl and hook and transfer to countertop to knead by hand. The dough may seem very sticky coming out of the bowl, but use the dough scraper to release the dough from the countertop, adding a little flour only when absolutely necessary. As you knead by hand, some dough may stick to the countertop as you pick up the dough and rotate it. If it's a very small amount of dough, scrape it up with the dough scraper and continue kneading. If a lot of dough is staying on the countertop, add 1 tbsp of the reserved flour and knead it in. The dough will become less sticky as it gains strength., Once the dough passes the windowpane test and is not overly sticky, skip to ""Rising the dough"" below., Kneading the dough by hand, Add 930g flour to a large mixing bowl, then add the liquid mixture and stir with a mixing spoon or dough whisk to mix thoroughly. Reserve the remaining 70g flour., It can be easier to start the kneading right in the bowl, but you can also turn out the mixture onto a countertop dusted with 1 tbsp of the reserved flour. Your goal is to use as little of the reserved flour as possible. The dough will become less sticky on its own as it gains strength., Kneading technique: Gather into a ball and flatten. Pull the top of the flattened ball and fold over the bottom, then use the heel of your hand to seal the fold. Pick up the dough, turn it 90 degrees, and repeat the process. If it's too difficult to pick up the dough cleanly from the counter with your hands, use a flexible plastic dough scraper to pick it up, and sprinkle 1 tbsp of the reserved flour in the bowl or on the countertop, and return the dough and knead until incorporated. Knead for about 8-10 minutes., At this point the dough should be tacky but not impossibly sticky — you should be able to rub your hands together and get all the dough off cleanly. If not, add 1 tbsp of the reserved flour and knead another 1-2 minutes., Test the dough strength with the windowpane test: tear off a chunk of dough approximately 2 tbsp in size. Hold the piece of dough up to a window or light, and, using your fingers, pinch and stretch the dough into as thin and flat a shape as you can. If you can stretch the dough so that light comes through the dough without the dough tearing, the dough is ready for its first rise (skip to ""Rising the dough"" below). If the windowpane tears, return the dough to the ball and knead for another minute or two and test again. Note: the dough probably doesn't need any more flour at this point, just more kneading., Rising the dough, Oil a large mixing bowl or food-safe tub (with a tight-fitting lid)., Form the dough into a tight ball, pulling gently down at the sides so that the dough is taut, and pinch underneath to seal., Place the ball of dough in the bowl or tub, turning to coat all sides in the oil, then cover (for a bowl, use plastic wrap or a kitchen towel; for a food-safe tub, use the tight-fitting lid)., Set aside in a warm (80-100°F), draft-free spot and let rise until doubled in size. Because of the lower amount of yeast compared to other recipes, the first rise will likely take significantly longer than other recipes might indicate (see note about yeast types and rising times). In a spot that's about 80°, the first rise can take about 2.5-3 hours. A spot that's closer to 90-100° will rise more quickly. Don't put the dough in an environment hotter than that., When the dough has completed its first rise, take the dough out of the bowl or tub (it probably will not come out completely cleanly; that's a good thing, just scrape it all together) and deflate it, reshaping into a tight ball as before and returning to the bowl or tub and cover for its second rise, which should take about 1/3 the time of the initial rise. When the dough has once again doubled in volume, the second rise is done. (Note: many bakers opt to skip this step, but I find the difference in quality to be worth the extra time and tiny effort.), Shaping, Challah is known for being a braided loaf. There are countless ways to braid a loaf; in this recipe I'll explain how to create the six-strand braid seen in the photo., Have a kitchen scale, dough scraper, and rolling pin on hand. Line two half-sheet pans with one piece of parchment or a silicone baking mat each. It's best to bake each loaf individually for the deepest color and an even doneness., Weigh the completed dough, which should be approximately 1800g. Divide in half and set aside one of the halves (each half makes one challah)., Working the first half, divide the dough into six equal pieces. Use the kitchen scale to measure precisely (tip: weigh in grams for easier math). It's perfectly ok to tear off little chunks to move between pieces to achieve pieces of equal weight. Once you've separated the dough into six equal pieces, form each into a tight ball, again stretching the sides down and pinching on the bottom., Making the ropes: Start with the first of the six balls you created, flip it over so the bottom of the ball is showing, and flatten the ball evenly on the countertop. You should not need any additional flour at this point — if your dough passed the windowpane test earlier, it should be strong enough to release from the countertop easily but also stick just enough to do the work you need to do.Using the rolling pin and starting from the center, roll up and down until you have a very flat (1/4"" thick) elongated oval. Use the heel of your hand to flatten the corners so if forms an evenly flat rectangle.Roll the rectangle tightly up on the long side to form a cigar shape. Roll the rope back and forth, pressing a little heavier on each end until you have a long, even rope about 1 inch/3cm thick with tapered ends. Pinch the seam shut, roll the rope a few more times to help the seal tighten, and set the rope aside, seam side down, while you complete the remaining ropes., Once all the ropes are done, the first ones will likely have contracted and thickened a little, and the seam may have reopened. Just pinch it shut again. Gently roll the ropes to lengthen them out again and make them even with each other, approximately an inch in diameter and 15 inches long. It's important to roll gently but assertively—you don't want to rip the strands of gluten. Finish each rope by tapering about an inch on each end even more, to about 1/4"" diameter., Creating a six-strand braid: Clear a large countertop or work surface. Arrange the ropes, seam side down, like the diagram here, where it looks like a stick figure with no head, two arms, and four legs. Pinch all ropes together at the top middle spot. Keep the seam sides down as you do the braid.Take the left arm (A) and swing it down just to the left of the inside right leg (D). This rope becomes the new D. Now move the outside right leg (E) up to become the new right arm (A). Repeat on the left: bring the right arm (F) down just to the left of the inside left leg (C). This is now the new C. Move the outside left leg (B) up to become the new right arm (F). Repeat, starting with A as before. When you can't braid further, pinch the bottom ends tightly together and tuck underneath the loaf. The top ends were already pinched when you began. Pinch again and tuck underneath the loaf, pinching underneath to seal the tucked end to the underside., Move the finished loaf to one of the parchment-lined half-sheet pans and cover with plastic wrap., Wait 10-15 minutes, then shape the second loaf and set aside on the second parchment-lined half-sheet pan and cover with plastic wrap., Final rise, Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until it has become large and puffy, about 50% larger in volume. Check the rise every 30 minutes or so. This may take two hours even in a warm kitchen with this recipe. It's important to complete this final rise; otherwise the braids may pull apart too much in baking. (But also don't overproof, which can lead to flatter finished results.) The more you do this, the better sense you'll have of how long this process takes in your kitchen and you can leave it alone longer., In the last half hour of the final rise, preheat the oven to 350°F., Make the egg wash: beat the remaining egg in a small dish along with 1 teaspoon of water until it has a very even consistency. Just before baking, brush the egg wash all over the loaf, making sure there are no dry spots. Save the egg wash, as you'll be reapplying it during the bake., Baking and cooling, Bake in the center of the oven for 15 minutes, then take out and apply another egg wash., Optional: at this point you can add toppings such as poppy seeds, sesame seeds, everything bagel seasoning, etc. Sprinkle over the loaf after the egg wash., Return to the oven and bake another 15-20 minutes, until the top is deeply golden and an instant-read thermometer registers 190-200° in the thickest part. Another way to check doneness is to flip the loaf over and thump it with the back of a spoon. If it makes a hollow sound, the loaf is probably ready to take out of the oven. Slide off the parchment onto a cooling rack and let cool for at least an hour. It doesn't need to be completely cool before you slice into it, but it does finish its baking during that first hour of cooling., After the bread is completely cool, you can store it in a plastic bag for 3-4 days. For the prettiest slices, slice diagonally across the bumps.","[('water', 240, 'g'), ('yeast', 13, 'g'), ('vegetable oil', 125, 'g'), ('honey', 165, 'g'), ('salt', 28, 'g'), ('eggs', 6, None), ('bread flour', 1000, 'g'), ('toppings', None), ('egg', 1, None)]"

The dough will be very sticky when mixing begins, but resist the urge to add more flour; the dough will absorb the excess moisture and come together nicely as the mixing progresses., Increase the speed to medium low and continue kneading until a smooth, elastic dough forms and is no longer sticky; 15 to 20 minutes. Set the timer! (It takes me exactly 20 minutes until its not sticky enough to handle) At this point, the dough should feel tacky (slightly sticky but not messy) and should easily come together in a taut ball when handled with lightly oiled hands. If this is not the case, then knead in a little more flour, one tablespoon at a time. A good indication of telling when the dough is ready, is being able to stretch between your hands into a thin film without it breaking right away. When it starts tearing, it will tear in a circular fashion., Using lightly oiled hands, shape the dough into a ball, and transfer to a lightly greased large bowl.

Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap and allow the rolls to rise for 40 to 50 minutes, until puffy. In the last 10 minutes of rising, preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C. If you want to ensure browned bottoms on your rolls, place a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven to heat., Prepare egg wash by whisking together the egg and heavy cream. When ready to bake, remove the plastic wrap from the pan, then gently brush the rolls with the egg wash. Bake the rolls (on top of the pizza stone/baking sheet, if using) for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown on top; a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the middle roll should register at least 190°F.

There is one way where you add the sugar to the yeast and another where you add the sugar to the flour. I have used both ways and they both work for me., Technique 1, In a bowl, add 1 cup of warm water and dry active yeast and let it stand until creamy (about 5 minutes)., In another bowl add flour, salt, and sugar. After 8 minutes take the yeast and give it a mix then add it to the flour mixture, mixing it in with a fork until sticky, add the additional cup of water a little at a time and continue to form it into a ball. Note: You may not need all of the water. Just make sure the dough is a tad bit moist. Add a little bit of flour at a time to get it to a less sticky consistency. Continue on with the steps 1-11 below., Technique 2, In a liquid measuring cup add 1/4 cup of lukewarm water, add the yeast and 2 teaspoons of granulated sugar. Check back in 10 minutes to make sure it has bubbled and foamed up. If it has then add lukewarm water up to the 2 cup mark of the measuring cup. Note: If it didn’t then you need to try another packet / jar of yeast., In a bowl blend the flour and salt, mix well. Next pour the water 1/2 cup at a time into the flour mix using your fork to blend. Continue to add as much of the water/yeast mixture that you need. Please note you may not need all of the water. You want the dough to be just a tad bit moist. Flour your hands and begin to form the round ball. Continue on with the steps 1-11 below., Continue with Steps 1-11 below, Next, sprinkle with a bit more flour and work it with your hands to make a ball. It’s not necessarily kneading per say. You are just rolling and tucking in gently to get a smooth ball, Take the dough and gently mold it into a smooth but firm ball with an elastic feel., Put the dough back into the bowl and cover with a kitchen towel and let it rise. This could take anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour. It all depends on the temperature in the house and the humidity. Since I am in Houston, Texas this takes me about 45 minutes., Once it rises take a little more flour, pat it down and roll it into a ball again., {OPTIONAL} Put the dough back into the bowl and let it rise 1 more time. When you let the bread rise twice it really makes for a better bread but if you are short on time then don’t worry about it., After you are done with all the rising, you will take the dough and put it on the parchment paper that is on a baking tray. The dough should be elongated and oval-shaped, with tapered and rounded (not pointed) ends., Take about 1 tablespoon of olive oil and coat the dough with it. This will make it nice and crunchy on the outside., After you rub it down with olive oil you can sprinkle a bit of sea salt or sesame seeds on top., Next, score the top of the dough with a sharp knife at a 45 degree angle.

Leave the dough to rest for 30 minutes., Now add the salt, sugar, butter and yeast to the bowl and knead the dough for around 3 to 6 minutes. You want the dough to be elastic, silky and slapping the sides of the bowl. Just keep the mixer going until you achieve this. If you are using a stand mixer you'll need to use your dough hook attachment for this step., Now you need to let your dough rise. You are using instant yeast as the leavening agent in this recipe, rather than sourdough/wild yeast, so it will rise very quickly, particularly if your home is warm. Leave it for around an hour (it will take longer if your house is cooler). You want it to double., While you're waiting for the dough to double, lightly butter a sandwich loaf or pullman pan so it's ready to go when the dough is shaped., Once the dough has doubled, tip it out onto the counter top with the smooth side underneath and the sticky side on the top. Gently ease the dough out into a rectangle. It should be quite easy to do this as the dough is very elastic., Now you want to shape your dough into a sandwich loaf. This is fairly easy. Make sure that the short side of the rectangle is in front of you. Fold each side of the dough into the middle, then roll the dough into a tight log with the seam underneath. Tighten the top of the dough by putting your hands at the base and pulling the dough towards you, without lifting if off the countertop., Once the dough is shaped, gently place it into the buttered loaf tin. Leave the dough to rise until it's just above the rim of the tin. This will take around an hour, depending on the temperature of your home., Once the dough has risen, you'll need to bake your loaf. Turn your oven on and set the temperature to around 180C/350F. Let it warm for around 10 minutes. Spray the top of your dough with some water mist and place into the oven. Make sure that there's plenty of room for it to grow in the oven as it will generally keep rising., Bake your bread at 180C/350F for around 40 to 45 minutes or until the loaf is golden brown., Remove from the loaf tin and allow to cool on a wire rack.","[('sourdough discard', 100.0, 'g'), ('water', 250.0, 'g'), ('bread flour', 500.0, 'g'), ('salt', 10.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 20.0, 'g'), ('butter', 60.0, 'g'), ('instant yeast', 7.0, 'g')]"

Mix until smooth, and then cover and let rest at room temperature for anywhere between 4 and 18 hours. The longer it ferments, the more sour your loaf will be. I’ve had success all across the time spectrum!, To make the dough, Whisk together the psyllium husk, sweetener, and water. Whisk until combined and let gel while preparing the flour mixture., In a large bowl or stand mixer, combine all of the flours + starches, plus salt. This is also where you’d adding any herbs and other dry seasonings if you want to flavor your dough., Whisk the psyllium gel mixture into the preferment, along with the olive oil if using, and any other wet seasonings (like garlic, soaked nuts or seeds, etc.)., Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture. Use a spoon and then your hands to bring the dough together, or use your dough hook to mix all of the ingredients until a smooth dough forms. It will take a few minutes in a stand mixer. If you’re using your hands, you will likely want to knead the dough together for a few minutes to make sure all the flour is hydrated and the dough is smooth., Once your dough is soft and smooth, turn it out onto a clean, smooth work surface. Lightly flour it if your dough seems sticky – mine usually doesn’t need any flour. Knead into a smooth ball, and use your hands to shape the dough into a round (or whatever shape you’re making)., Dust your banneton or tea towel-lined bowl generously with brown rice flour. You can place the dough directly into the banneton if you want the horizontal lines you see on my round loaves, or you can use the liner for a smoother look., Use a dough scraper or your hands to transfer the dough into your banneton, or a bowl lined with a clean tea towel. Put the smooth side facing down, so the “seams” of the loaf are facing up. Since we’ll flip the loaf before baking, the seams will be on the bottom after baking., Cover, and let the dough proof for about three to four hours at room temperature, or overnight in the refrigerator. (While this timing works pretty consistently for me here in San Diego, other bakers have mentioned that sometimes their bread can take up to 6 to 8 hours to rise well. Remember to look for the soft, puffy texture instead of relying strongly on the exact timing. Conditions of weather, your starter, ingredients, etc. can vary this timing pretty widely!), When you're ready to bake, An hour before your dough is fully proofed, turn on the oven to 425°F. Make sure your Dutch oven is preheating inside of the oven if you’re using one. If you did an overnight proof in the refrigerator, I recommend taking the bread out to finish rising at room temperature for an hour to two while the oven preheats. You want the loaf to feel puffy when it’s going into the oven., When your oven is preheated and your dough is well proofed, carefully flip the dough onto a sheet of parchment paper. Score the bread as desired, making sure your cut is deep enough, otherwise, you’ll still have cracking where you didn’t cut through., Remove your hot Dutch oven, carefully, from the oven. Carefully lower your loaf into the Dutch oven, being careful not to drop it in, which will cause gumminess and reduce the loaf’s rise. Replace the lid, and put your bread into the oven for 45 minutes., After 45 minutes of baking, remove the lid and let it finish baking for 25 to 40 minutes. The exact timing will depend on your oven and how golden brown you want your bread., Once the bread is golden brown to your liking, remove it from the oven. Very carefully remove the bread from the Dutch oven and let cool completely at room temperature before slicing into it. This is the hardest part, but worth the wait!, To store your sourdough bread, It will keep well at room temperature for two or three days. You can store it in a linen bread bag to extend its life. If your loaf gets a bit stale, put it in a 300°F for 10 minutes to refresh the crust. You can also slice and freeze the bread.

Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form., Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it's TOO sticky (meaning it's sticking to the bottom of the mixer, add in 2 tablespoons more bread flour.) If you don’t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface., Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel.

(Tip: you want the dough as airy as possible, so do be gentle with the dough and don’t do anything to flatten it.), Now, this is where we shape it. You basically want to shape it into a ball so take each side and pull it up towards the middle. Keep doing this until you get it round., Grab another mixing bowl, flour it, and place the rounded dough upside down. Grab your towel again and cover it for another 30 minutes., While your dough continues to rise, pre-heat your oven to 460F and place your dutch oven inside (lid on) so it gets really hot – around 30 minutes., Once the 30-minutes is up, carefully take out the dutch oven, place the dough inside (right side up!) of your pre-heated dutch oven, sprinkle some flour on top, and place the dutch oven (lid on!) back into your oven for 30 minutes., Remove dutch oven from oven and take off the lid., Place back in the oven and cook for another 15 minutes – or until the outside is brown and flaky., Let the bread sit for 15 minutes before cutting open.

The dough is fairly moist and sticky, but resist the temptation to add additional flour, unless it's so moist that it won't combine. Conversely, if it's too dry, add up to one-quarter cup water. Erring on the side of too moist is always preferable to dry in bread-making., After kneading, turn the dough out into a large, greased bowl, cover with plasticwrap, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 90 minutes, or until doubled in size. Create a warm environment by preheating your oven for 1 to 2 minutes to 400F, then shutting it off. This creates a 90F-ish warm spot. Slide the bowl in and wait while the yeast works. Just make sure your oven is off., After the dough has doubled, punch it down, turn it out onto a floured surface or Silpat and knead it for about 3 minutes. With your fingers, shape it into a 10-inch by 6-inch rectangle, just eyeball it. The long side should be slightly longer than the baking pan. Then, fold the short sides in so that dough is about 8 inches in length. Roll to form a tight cylinder. There's not much to roll, about 3 turns. Optionally, when rolling, sprinkle with cinnamon, nutmeg, ground ginger. Or go savory with dill, chives, or thyme., Spray an 8-by-4-inch loaf pan with floured cooking spray (or grease and flour the pan) and place the cylinder in the pan, seam side down.

Then use a spatula or dough scraper to transfer the bread dough into the tin. Wet your fingers and use them to gently level and smooth out the top of the dough., Rub one side of large piece of cling film (larger than your loaf tin) with a little olive oil and lay, oil-side down, over the bread tin and dough. Ensure it is slightly baggy, to allow the dough space to rise, rather than maing it taut. Then leave to prove for about 1 hour, or until the dough has reached the top of the tin. On a cold day it may take slightly longer, on a warm day slightly less., Once proved, preheat your oven to 200C (fan). Lightly brush the top of the loaf with oil and use a sharp knife with a wet blade (just run under water - it helps ensure the dough does not stick to the nife) to make 5 slashes (about 1 cm deep) across the top of the loaf., Place on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 35 minutes.

Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes. *If you do not own a stand mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/silicone spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula is a better choice.*, Add the remaining sugar, egg, butter, salt, and 1 cup flour. With a dough hook or paddle attachment, mix/beat on low speed for 30 seconds, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula, then add the remaining flour. Beat on medium speed until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes. If the dough seems too wet to a point where kneading (next step) would be impossible, beat in more flour 1 Tablespoon at a time until you have a workable dough, similar to the photos above. Dough should be soft and a little sticky, but still manageable to knead with lightly floured hands., Knead the dough, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st Rise, Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter. Takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), Grease a 9×13 inch baking pan or two 9-inch square or round baking pans. You can also bake the rolls in a cast iron skillet or on a lined baking sheet.*, Shape the rolls, When the dough is ready, punch it down to release the air. Divide the dough into 14-16 equal pieces. (Just eyeball it– doesn’t need to be perfect!) A bench scraper is always helpful for cutting dough. Shape each piece into a smooth ball. Arrange in prepared baking pan., 2nd Rise:, Cover shaped rolls with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow to rise until puffy, about 1 hour., Adjust oven rack to a lower position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). (It’s best to bake the rolls towards the bottom of the oven so the tops don’t burn.), Bake the rolls, Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown on top, rotating the pan halfway through. If you notice the tops browning too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil.

Use a grease pencil or piece of tape to mark the level of the dough when you start. Makes it a lot more obvious when the dough has doubled., Fold, Reach down 1 side of the bowl and gently but firmly pull the dough up and fold it over itself. Don’t punch it down. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn and repeat. Continue turning and folding 2 more times. Cover and let rest until doubled in size, about 30 minutes., Fold More, Repeat the turning and folding process, cover with plastic, and let the dough rest until doubled in size, about 30 minutes more., Shape the dough, Roll, Divide the dough into ten equal pieces, about 4 1/4 ounces (120 grams) each. Lightly flour your hands. Cup one hand over a chunk of dough and roll it on your work surface in a circle to tighten the ball. Being somewhat neurotic, I count the turns—no fewer and no more than 40 revolutions. Repeat with the remaining dough., Rest, Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with a floured non-terrycloth kitchen towel or a baker’s couche. Cover them with a kitchen towel. Let rest for 20 minutes., Transfer the balls to your work surface. Heavily dust the towel again., Shape, Flour your hands. Flatten a dough ball into a 6-inch (15-cm) disc. Using the side of your hand, make a deep crease (think karate chop) across the middle of the disc., Tug, Grab both ends of the crease and gently tug them to elongate the dough into a slight oval., Fold one half of the dough over the other along the crease. The dough will have a half-moon shape., Twist the ends of the half-moon into fat points and, using your thumbs, flatten them a bit to seal., Shape, Gently transfer the papo seco to the towel, seam-side down. As you shape more rolls, arrange them in a row, few inches apart. Pull the towel up between each row to create a ridge that will hold the shape of the rolls during proofing. Repeat the shaping and lining up the papo-secos, folding up the towel between rows., Cover the rolls with a towel and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size, about 30 minutes., Bake the papo secos, Preheat, Meanwhile, position a rack in the middle of the oven and slip in a baking stone or tiles. Place an empty metal tray on any rack that won’t interfere with the rising papo secos. (Do not use a glass pan as it could shatter.) Crank the heat to 500°F (260°C). The oven and stone will need time to properly heat., Prep Water, Have a cup of very hot tap water at the ready., Bake, Coat a baking peel or rimless baking sheet with cornmeal. Carefully turn a few of the papo secos seam-side up and arrange them on the peel., Bake, Place the front edge of the peel at the back of the baking stone and quickly yank it toward you to shift the dough onto the baking stone. Repeat with the remaining papo secos. Quickly but carefully pour the hot water into the metal tray and immediately shut the oven door to trap the steam. Immediately reduce the heat to 425°F (218°C).☞ TESTER TIP: If your baking stone can’t fit all of the rolls, bake them in batches. As the Portuguese say, Não faz mal.

After about 15 – 30 seconds, a gel will form., In a large bowl, mix together the buckwheat flour, potato starch, brown rice flour and salt, until evenly combined., Add the yeast mixture, psyllium gel and apple cider vinegar to the dry ingredients. Knead the dough until smooth and it starts coming away from the bowl, about 5 – 10 minutes. You can knead by hand or using a stand mixer with a dough hook., Transfer the bread to a lightly oiled surface and knead it gently, forming it into a smooth ball. Place the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, seam side down, cover with a damp tea towel and allow to rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size., Once risen, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead it gently while forming it into a tight ball (see post for step-by-step photos). Flip it seam side down onto a part of the work surface that isn’t covered in flour and rotate in place to seal the seams., Place the dough into a 7 inch round proofing basket that you’ve dusted with some brown rice flour with the seams facing upwards. Cover with a damp tea towel and proof in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size., While the loaf is proofing, pre-heat the oven to 480 ºF (250 ºC) with a cast iron skillet on the middle rack or a Dutch oven/combo cooker on the lower middle rack. If you’re using a skillet, place a baking tray on the bottom rack of the oven., Once the dough has doubled in size, turn it out of the bread basket onto a piece of baking paper and score the top with a pattern of choice (the easiest pattern is a cross, about ¼ – ½ inch deep), using a bread lame or sharp knife. Take the hot cast iron skillet or Dutch oven/combo cooker out of the oven and then transfer the bread along with the baking paper into it.For a skillet or combo cooker, this is easiest by sliding a pizza peel or baking sheet underneath the baking paper and then using it to slide the bread along with the baking paper gently into the hot skillet/combo cooker. For a Dutch oven, use the sides of the baking paper as handles to transfer the bread into it., If using a skillet: place the skillet in the oven, pour hot water into the bottom baking tray, add 3 – 4 ice cubes around the bread (between the baking/greaseproof paper and the skillet), and close the oven door., If using a Dutch oven/combo cooker: add 3 – 4 ice cubes around the bread (between the baking/greaseproof paper and the walls of the Dutch oven/combo cooker) and close it, then place it into the pre-heated oven., Bake at 480 ºF (250 ºC) with steam for 20 minutes – don’t open the Dutch oven or the oven doors during this initial period, as that would allow the steam to escape out of the oven., After the 20 minutes, remove the bottom tray with water from the oven (for cast iron skillet) or uncover the Dutch oven/combo cooker, reduce the oven temperature to 450 ºF (230 ºC), and bake for a further 40 - 50 minutes in a steam-free environment. The final loaf should be of a deep, dark brown colour. If the loaf starts browning too quickly, cover with a piece of aluminium foil, shiny side up, and continue baking until done., Transfer the loaf onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely., Storage: The gluten free bread keeps well in a closed container or wrapped in a tea towel in a cool dry place for 3 – 4 days.","[('yeast', 8.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 20.0, 'g'), ('water', 390.0, 'g'), ('psyllium husk', 20.0, 'g'), ('buckwheat flour', 130.0, 'g'), ('potato starch', 100.0, 'g'), ('brown rice flour', 90.0, 'g'), ('salt', 10.0, 'g'), ('apple cider vinegar', 12.0, 'g')]"

Leave it for 2-3 hours to rise in a somewhat warm place until it's doubled in volume, like photo in previous step (If it's cold out, I like to preheat my oven for a few minutes, then turn it off, then place the bowl in the oven, trapping the heat inside. If your house is warm just leave it out, or if it's warm outside you can place it there)., Bake or refrigerate., After the two-three hour rise time when the dough has about doubled, you have two options: bake, or store in the fridge. See notes for how to store., Preheat the Dutch oven., 30 minutes to an hour before you are ready to bake, preheat your oven to 450 degrees F. Place your Dutch oven in the oven, with the lid ON, while the oven is preheating. Once the oven reaches 450, keep it preheating for another 20 minutes, so the Dutch oven gets good and hot., Flour parchment paper and add dough., Scrape the dough into the edge of a piece of parchment paper dusted with flour. Make it into as much of a ""loaf"" shape as you can by folding the edges up on top of it (a silicone spatula works well for this)., Shape the loaf., Then, use the edges of the parchment paper to flip the loaf over so the floured side is on top and the loaf is in the center of the parchment paper. Don't worry about it looking beautiful or smooth on top. My Dutch oven is an oval, so I made an oval shape. You can do a circle if yours is round., Score the loaf., Optional: use a very sharp knife or clean razor blade to cut a few slits across the top of the loaf about 1/2"" deep, across the entire top.

Add the yeast and whisk for about 15 seconds until well incorporated. Rest for 15 minutes to activate the yeast - it will turn a bit foamy and frothy., Meanwhile, sift the flour, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl., Knead the dough. Add the yeast mixture and 1 tablespoon of oil to the flour. Stir to combine with a fork. When the dough is shaggy and you can no longer stir it with a fork, transfer it to a clean work surface and oil your hands well. Start kneading the dough with your hands, oiling your hands several times as you go. The dough will be very sticky and stick to the surface and your hands during the first few minutes, but as you continue kneading, it will stop sticking and become soft, elastic, and pliable. The kneading process should take 4 to 6 minutes., Rest the dough. Oil a large bowl, add the dough ball to the bowl, and coat it with a bit of oil on all sides. Cover the dough with a clean dish towel. Rest in a warm, draft-free place for 90 minutes (up to 4 hours), until the dough rises and at least doubles. I place it in my oven with the oven light on. If it’s summer or you live in a warm climate, the counter works great., Once the dough has risen, lightly punch the dough to release the air. Briefly knead the dough with your hands into a ball until smooth and tacky (it shouldn't stick to your hands)., Divide the dough. Using a pastry cutter, divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Use your hands to roll the dough into 8 balls.*** Transfer the balls to a sheet of parchment paper and spread them apart to prevent sticking. Cover with a dish towel and rest for 10 minutes to “proof” the dough., Preheat the pan. Open nearby windows, as it may get smoky. Heat a large cast-iron skillet (or an iron tawa pan**) for which you have a large enough lid over medium-high heat until it's nearly smoking, at least 5 minutes.NOTE: my gas stove heat dial goes up to level 7. I use level 5 but usually lower it to 4 after the first 3-4 naans.TIP: You can test if it’s hot enough by adding a drop of water - if it sizzles immediately, it’s ready., Prep before cooking the naan. Pour the vegan butter into a small bowl and add the grated garlic. Microwave on high for 20 seconds, stir, then microwave for another 20 seconds. Set the butter next to stove with a pastry brush. Put a small bowl of water next to your work space., Roll out the naan. Using a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into a oval shape, about 8 inches long long and 5 inches wide at its widest point (20 cm x 13 cm). Roll the naan almost as thinly as you can. TIP: roll outward and off (instead of rolling back and forth on the same spot)., Add the cilantro and water the back side. Sprinkle each naan with a bit of chopped cilantro. Roll the rolling pin once over the dough to get the cilantro to stick. Dampen your hands using the water bowl and flip the naan onto its back side. Pat a small amount of water all over the back side of the dough (this will help the naan stick to the pan). NOTE: Cover the remaining dough balls while you roll each nan., Cook the naan. Dampen your hands again and pick up the naan and carefully place it in the hot skillet, watered side facing down. Once you see bubbles all over and the edges start to dry out (45 to 60 seconds, depending on heat level), flip the naan. Now cover the skillet with the lid and cook for 30 to 40 seconds. When it’s done, parts of the dough should look almost raw and doughy, with some parts charred. NOTE: You may need to slightly lower the heat after the 3rd or 4th naan., Transfer naan to a plate and brush with the melted garlic butter and sprinkle with just a pinch of flaky sea salt. Repeat the process with the remaining naan. Serve and eat while still warm!

Add the water. Mix until the flour is absorbed. (If you are using active dry yeast, see notes below.), Let it rise, Cover bowl with a tea towel or plastic wrap and set aside in a warm spot to rise for at least an hour. (In the winter or if you are letting the bread rise in a cool place, it might take as long as two hours to rise.) This is how to create a slightly warm spot for your bread to rise in: Turn the oven on at any temperature (350ºF or so) for one minute, then turn it off. Note: Do not allow the oven to get up to 300ºF, for example, and then heat at that setting for 1 minute — this will be too hot. Just let the oven preheat for a total of 1 minute — it likely won’t get above 100ºF. The goal is to just create a slightly warm environment for the bread., Preheat the oven to 425ºF, . Grease two 1-qt or 1.5-qt oven-safe bowls (see notes below) with about a tablespoon of butter each. Using two forks, punch down your dough, scraping it from the sides of the bowl, which it will be clinging to. As you scrape it down try to pull the dough toward the center (see video below for guidance). You want to loosen the dough entirely from the sides of the bowl, and you want to make sure you’ve punched it down. Then, take your two forks and divide the dough into two equal portions — eye the center of the mass of dough, and starting from the center and working out, pull the dough apart with the two forks. Then scoop up each half and place into your prepared bowls. This part can be a little messy — the dough is very wet and will slip all over the place. Using small forks or forks with short tines makes this easier — my small salad forks work best; my dinner forks make it harder. It’s best to scoop it up fast and plop it in the bowl in one fell swoop. Some people like to use flexible, plastic dough scrapers for this step., Let the dough rise again, for about 20 to 30 minutes on the countertop near the oven (or near a warm spot) or until it has risen to just below or above (depending on what size bowl you are using) the top of the bowls. (Note: Do not do the warm-oven trick for the second rise, and do not cover your bowls for the second rise. Simply set your bowls on top of your oven, so that they are in a warm spot. Twenty minutes in this spot usually is enough for my loaves.), Bake it, Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375º and bake for 15 to 17 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and turn the loaves onto cooling racks. If you’ve greased the bowls well, the loaves should fall right out onto the cooling racks. If the loaves look a little pale and soft when you’ve turned them out onto your cooling racks, place the loaves into the oven (outside of their bowls) and let them bake for about 5 minutes longer.

Add 1/2 cup flour and whisk together. Place the mixing bowl in a warm place, uncovered to form a lose sponge. Give it 15 minutes or so, the mixture should bubble., Form the pita dough, Now add salt, olive oil and almost all the remaining flour (keep about 1/2 cup of the flour for dusting later). Stir until mixture forms a shaggy mass (at this point, the dough has little to no gluten development and just looks like a sticky mess and you can easily pull bits off). Dust with a little flour, then knead the mixture inside the bowl for about a minute to incorporate any stray bits., Knead the dough, Dust a clean working surface with just a little bit of flour. Knead lightly for a couple minutes or so until smooth. Cover and let the dough rest for 10 minutes, then knead again for a couple more minutes. The dough should be a little bit moist, you can help it with a little dusting of flour, but be careful not to add too much flour., Let the dough rise, Clean the mixing bowl and coat it lightly with extra virgin olive oil and put the dough back in the bowl. Turn the dough a couple times in the bowl to coat with the olive oil. Cover the mixing bowl tightly with plastic wrap then lay a kitchen towel over. Put the bowl in a warm place. Leave it alone for 1 hour or until the dough rises to double its size., Divide the dough., Deflate the dough and place it on a clean work surface. Divide the dough into 7 to 8 equal pieces and shape them into balls. Cover with a towel and leave them for 10 minutes or so to rest., Shape the pitas., Using a floured rolling pin, roll one of the pieces into a circle that's 8-9 inches wide and about a quarter inch thick. It helps to lift and turn the dough frequently as you roll so that dough doesn't stick to your counter too much. (If dough starts to stick, sprinkle a tiny bit of flour). If the dough starts to spring back, set it aside to rest for a few minutes, then continue rolling. Repeat with the other pieces of dough. (Once you get going, you can be cooking one pita while rolling another, if you like). You have two options for baking the pita from here., To bake pita in the oven:, Heat the oven to 475 degrees F and place a heavy-duty baking pan or large cast iron skillet on the middle rack to heat. Working in batches, place the rolled-out pitas directly on the hot baking baking sheet (I was only able to fit 2 at a time). Bake for 2 minutes on one side, and then, using a pair of tongs, carefully turn pita over to bake for 1 minute on the other side. The pita will puff nicely and should be ready. Remove from the oven and cover the baked pitas with a clean towel while you work on the rest of the pitas., To cook pita on stovetop: Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. (Test by adding a couple drops of water to the skillet, the skillet is ready when the beads of water sizzle immediately). Drizzle a tiny bit of extra virgin olive oil and wipe off any excess. Working with one pita at a time, lay a rolled-out pita on the skillet and bake for 30 seconds, until bubbles start to form. Using a spatula, flip the pita over and cook for 1-2 minutes on the other side, until large toasted spots appear on the underside. Flip again and cook another 1-2 minutes to toast the other side. The pita is ready when it puffs up forming a pocket (sometimes, with this method, the pita may not puff or may only form a small pocket. Try pressing the surface of the pita gently with a clean towel). Keep baked pita covered with a clean towel while you work on the rest.","['water', 1.0, 'cup'], ['yeast', 2.0, 'tsp'], ['sugar', 0.5, 'tsp'], ['flour', 3.0, 'cups'], ['salt', 1.0, 'tsp'], ['olive oil', 2.0, 'tbsp']"

Place over a medium/low heat and whisk constantly until the mixture has thickened to a paste/pudding-like consistency (think wallpaper paste...). Scrape it into a small bowl, cover with clingfilm directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming and leave to cool to room temperature., To make the dough, Place the flour in a large bowl (or the bowl of your stand mixer, fitted with a dough hook) and add the yeast to one side, the salt, sugar, mixed spice and orange zest to the other (if the salt is added on top of the yeast it can kill it), stir to combine., Whisk together the cooled tangzhong, milk powder, egg and milk until smooth and add it to the dry ingredients. Mix everything together until it forms a soft, shaggy dough. If you are kneading by hand, turn the dough out onto a worktop and knead for 5-10 minutes until it starts to feel smooth and a little less sticky (it will still be very sticky), don't be tempted to add any extra flour, the dough is meant to be sticky! The best way to knead a wet dough by hand is to stretch it up away from the worktop (it will stick), then slap it back down, make sure that you pull from a different section each time and keep a dough scraper handy. If you are using a stand mixer, mix for 5 minutes or so until the dough is smooth., Add the butter and mix until it is fully incorporated, continue to knead until the dough is very elastic and begins to come away from the worktop (or sides of the stand mixer bowl) cleanly. It should pass the windowpane test - stretch the dough with your hands, you should be able to stretch it to a very thin, almost transparent membrane without it tearing. This can take up to 20 minutes of kneading, especially by hand., Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with clingfilm, leave to rise for 1-2 hours until well doubled in size. Alternatively, place it in the fridge to rise overnight. If you refrigerate it, the following day let it come up to room temperature for about half an hour before continuing., Line an 8.5x4.5in (or thereabouts) loaf tin with baking parchment. Once the dough has risen, punch it down and fold it in on itself a couple of times then knead in the candied peel and raisins until evenly distributed., Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, divide it in to six equal pieces and roll each one into a ball., Roll each ball out into an oval, fold one third of the oval over the middle (from the side, not the top), then the other third over the top to form a long, narrow packet. Roll over the seam to flatten it, then roll it up from one end to make a fat sausage. Repeat with the other balls of dough then arrange them in the loaf tin in two rows of three, seam side down. (You can skip this step and simply shape the dough into balls and arrange them in the tin; rolling the dough like this just gives the loaf pretty swirly sides)., Loosely cover with oiled clingfilm and leave to rise until at least doubled in size, this can take 1-2 hours (mine took nearly 2). If you press the dough gently with a finger the indentation should spring back slowly but remain visible. If it springs back quickly it needs to prove for a little longer. Preheat the oven while the dough is rising to 180C/350F/gas mark 4., To make the crosses, place the flour in a small bowl and gradually stir in the milk until you have a thick, but pourable paste. Transfer the paste to a small disposable piping bag and snip off the tip, pipe a cross on the top of each bun., Bake the loaf on the lower middle shelf of the oven for 40-50 minutes until well risen and the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom, the internal temperature should reach at least 94C/200F on a probe thermometer.

Allow to sit for 1 minute. Whisk in salt, brown sugar, and melted butter. Slowly add 3 cups of flour, 1 cup at a time. Mix with a wooden spoon (or dough hook attached to stand mixer) until dough is thick. Add 3/4 cup more flour until the dough is no longer sticky. If it is still sticky, add 1/4 – 1/2 cup more, as needed. Poke the dough with your finger—if it bounces back, it is ready to knead., Knead the dough:, Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., Shape the kneaded dough into a ball. Cover lightly with a towel and allow to rest for 10 minutes. (Meanwhile, I like to get the water + baking soda boiling as instructed in step 6.), Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Silicone baking mats are highly recommended over parchment paper. If using parchment paper, lightly spray with nonstick spray or grease with butter. Set aside., With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut dough into 1/3 cup sections (about 75g each)., Roll the dough into a 20-22 inch rope. Form a circle with the dough by bringing the two ends together at the top of the circle. Twist the ends together. Bring the twisted ends back down towards yourself and press them down to form a pretzel shape., Bring baking soda and 9 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Drop 1-2 pretzels into the boiling water for 20-30 seconds. Any more than that and your pretzels will have a metallic taste. Using a slotted spatula, lift the pretzel out of the water and allow as much of the excess water to drip off. Place pretzel onto prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle each with coarse sea salt. Repeat with remaining pretzels. If desired, you can cover and refrigerate the boiled/unbaked pretzels for up to 24 hours before baking in step 7., Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown., Remove from the oven and serve warm with spicy nacho cheese sauce., Cover and store leftover pretzels at room temperature for up to 3 days.

If you just stick that measuring cup in the bag of flour and scoop some out, you will get a lot more flour than what the recipe calls for.

Gently stir to mix., Allow the yeast to sit in a warm place for about 15 minutes, until it's activated and becomes frothy. This could take longer if your yeast was in the freezer. If the yeast doesn't activate (no frothy bubbles), then your yeast is likely too old and you will need it replaced with fresh yeast., Once the yeast is activated, you’re ready to make the bread dough., Bread loaf, To the proofed yeast mixture, add the flour, warm water, salt, honey, citric acid and melted butter., Using a dough whisk or a spatula, mix the ingredients to form a rough dough., Place the bowl in the mixer with a kneading hook attached, and knead the dough on low speed for about 2 - 5 minutes, until the dough comes together to form a ball., Increase the speed by 1 or 2 levels (speed 3 or 4 in a kitchen aid mixer) and knead the dough for a further 12 - 15 minutes until it's smooth and elastic., While the dough is kneading, check on it every few minutes to make sure it’s kneading well, and is not too dry or too wet. The dough is going to be very sticky and wet at the beginning, and become smoother as it's kneaded., To check if the dough has the right consistency after about 10 minutes of kneading - Increase the speed of the mixer to about 5 or 6 just for a minute or two. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, then it’s too wet, so add a little extra flour (a dusting at a time), to get the right texture. If the dough is still tacky but is coming off the sides (mostly), and only sticking to the bottom of the bowl, then it's at the right consistency. When you stop the mixer and lift the kneading hook from the bowl, and the dough isn’t sticking to the bottom of the bowl, then the dough might be too dry. You may need to add a little extra water (just ½ tsp at a time), to get the right consistency. The dough should be smooth, a little soft and tacky to the touch., Once the dough is kneaded, remove the dough hook and fold the dough over a few times by hand, to get a smooth ball. Then place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough proof for about 1 hour until it has at least doubled in size., While the dough is proofing, prepare the bread loaf pans. Butter 1 - 9 x 5 inch loaf pan for a very large loaf, or 2 - 8.5 x 4.5 inch loaf pans for smaller loaves, and set aside until the dough is ready., Turn the proofed dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Slightly flatten is with your hands. If making two smaller loaves, halve the dough with a sharp knife or bench scraper. (For more accurately halved dough, weigh the dough and then split it evenly by weight.) Place one portion of the dough back in the bowl and place it in the fridge while you shape the first portion., Gently press the dough into an evenly thick rectangle. The short side of this rectangle should be roughly about 8 - 8.5 inches (i.e. slightly shorter than the length of your bread loaf pan)., Next, tightly roll up the short side, along the length of the dough rectangle. Make sure to pinch / press the edge of the dough as you go, while rolling it up (read the post and see pictures for more details)., Once the dough is rolled up, pinch the seams to seal it, and tuck in the two sides and pinch these seams as well. Make sure all the seams are on one side (this will be the bottom) and the other side is smooth and seam-free (this will be the top)., Transfer this into the prepared loaf pan, seam side down, and press the dough into the pan. Make sure it’s evenly pressed into the bottom of the pan. Loosely cover the loaf pan with plastic wrap and let it proof again in a warm place, for about 45 minutes - 1 hour. The dough should double in size inside the loaf pan / pans., Repeat with the second portion of dough (if making two smaller loaves)., To check if it has proofed enough, gently press the top of the dough with your finger to leave an indentation that is about ½ cm deep. If proofed properly, this indentation should remain, or only bounce back slightly. If it bounces back almost completely, then it's underproofed. (Read the post and see pictures for more details.), Preheat the oven (conventional oven) to 375°F / 190°C, during the last 30 minutes of the second proofing time. It’s best for the oven to be preheated to the right temperature for at least 20 minutes before baking the bread., When the bread loaf is ready and the oven has preheated, place the loaf pans in the middle of the oven, and bake for 35 - 45 minutes. Make sure there is at least 2 inches of space between the pans to allow for proper air circulation. The bread is done when it sounds hollow when tapped on top, OR when the internal temperature reaches 195°F / 91°C., Remove the pans from the oven and keep in a warm place (away from drafts) to cool. After about 10 minutes, remove the bread from the pans and keep it on a wire rack to cool down completely. The bread is now ready to be served., Optional - brush melted butter on top while it's hot to add more buttery flavor., Keep the loaf (or loaves) in a bread box at room temperature for up to 4 - 5 days, or slice and keep in the freezer for up to 1 month.","[('active dry yeast', 7.0, 'g'), ('water', 1.0, 'cup'), ('honey', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('flour', 19.5, 'ounces'), ('water', 0.5, 'cup'), ('sea salt', 1.25, 'tsp'), ('honey', 2.0, 'tbsp'), ('citric acid', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('butter', 2.0, 'tbsp')]"

Cover with a clean sack cloth towel or sprayed plastic wrap and wait about 20 minutes, or until the mixture has almost doubled in size and looks “sponge-like”., Create Dough, Add the vital wheat gluten, 1 more cup of flour, salt, and butter (or oil) to your sponge. It is normal for your sponge to “deflate” as you mix this together. Slowly incorporate the remaining flour in ½ cup increments. When the dough seems soft, not too sticky, and is gently pulling away from the sides of the bowl, it means you’ve added enough flour. Knead for 10 minutes., If you are kneading by hand: when the dough mixture becomes more difficult to stir and work with in the bowl (usually at about 5 – 5 ½ cups). I like to work in the rest of the flour by hand. Place the dough on a clean, floured work surface. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and begin to knead. The quicker you work your hands, the less likely they are to stick. I like to knead by pulling in the corners of the dough with my fingers and then pressing down with heel of my hand, quickly and gently over and over again. While doing so, I continue to slowly add additional spoonfuls of flour. This will take about 10 minutes depending on how fast you knead. You know the dough is ready when it’s not too sticky, and very soft., After kneading, round out the dough into a circle; doesn’t have to be perfect. Grease or flour the bottom of a bowl, place dough in bowl, and cover. Let rise about 25-30 minutes, or until doubled in size., Forming the Loaves, Grease two 9x5 inch pans. Punch down the risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. Gently work your dough into a thick rectangle (about 12x8)and fold into thirds. Roll it up, pinch the seams together, and gently throw your loaf on the work surface to release any last air bubbles. (There are many ways to form a loaf. Do what's comfortable and what works for you.), Place loaves in prepared pans, cover, and let rise again for about 25 minutes, or until thepeak of the loaf is just arching over the rim of the pan., While dough rises, preheat oven to 350°(I like 375°F for high altitude)., Bake, Bake for about 25 minutes or until bottoms are golden brown.

I suggest the bread mixer. The first time I made this I did it by hand. Because whole wheat is heavier I could only last about 2 minutes. I baked it but this was not a light textured bread.

Mix to combine. You can use a bowl and a spoon and then knead it by hand if you want to, but it will just take longer., Next add in the rest of your water, the olive oil, and the salt, and mix to combine., Then, keep adding in the rest of your flour while mixing on low until your dough starts pulling away from the sides of the bowl., Take the sticky dough out of the bowl and finish kneading it on the table with a tiny bit of flour until the dough looks smooth and bounces back when you touch it with your finger., Next, put the dough into a bowl greased with olive oil., Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and place the covered bowl in a warm area for 1-2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size. I put my bread in my oven turned OFF with just the light on to proof my bread, or in a proofing drawer., Then, prepare your baking pan by covering the bottom of the pan with a thin layer of olive oil. I know this looks like a lot but trust me, you need it. You want it to be a swimming pool of oil!, Take your very soft dough out of the bowl and stretch it with your hands to make it longer., Next, place it into the pan with the oil and use your hands to stretch it out to the edges. If the dough shrinks back, let the dough rest for 20 minutes then come back and stretch it some more. Letting the dough rest relaxes the gluten and keeps it from shrinking. Keep doing this until you can get the dough all the way to the edges of the pan., Cover the pan with some plastic wrap and put it in the fridge overnight. The yeast will continue eating those sugars and rise very slowly.

Pour in the water and gently mix together with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon. The dough will seem dry and shaggy, but keep working it until all the flour is moistened. If needed, use your hands (as I do in the video tutorial below) to work the dough ingredients together. The dough will be sticky. Shape into a ball in the bowl as best you can., Keeping the dough in the bowl, cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and set on the counter at room temperature (honestly any normal room temperature is fine!). Allow to rise for 2-3 hours. The dough will just about double in size, stick to the sides of the bowl, and have a lot of air bubbles., You can continue with step 4 immediately, but for absolute best flavor and texture, I strongly recommend letting this risen dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours and up to 3 days. Place covered dough in the refrigerator for 12 hours – 3 days. I usually let it rest in the refrigerator for about 18 hours. The dough will puff up during this time, but may begin to deflate after 2 days. That’s fine and normal—nothing to worry about., Lightly dust a large nonstick baking sheet (with or without rims and make sure it’s nonstick) with flour and/or cornmeal. Turn the cold dough out onto a floured work surface. Using a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut dough in half. Some air bubbles will deflate as you work with it. Place dough halves on prepared baking sheet. Using floured hands, shape into 2 long loaves about 9×3 inches each (doesn’t have to be exact) about 3 inches apart. Loosely cover and allow to rest for 45 minutes. You will bake the dough on this prepared baking sheet., During this 45 minutes, preheat the oven to 475°F (246°C)., When ready to bake, using a very sharp knife or bread lame (some even use kitchen shears), score the bread loaves with 3 slashes, about 1/2 inch deep. (“Score” = shallow cut.) If the shaped loaves flattened out during the 45 minutes, use floured hands to narrow them out along the sides again., Optional for a slightly crispier crust: After the oven is preheated and bread is scored, place a shallow metal or cast iron baking pan or skillet (I usually use a metal 9×13-inch baking pan) on the bottom oven rack. Carefully and quickly pour 3-4 cups of boiling water into it. Place the scored dough/baking pan on a higher rack and quickly shut the oven, trapping the steam inside. The steam helps create a crispier crust., Place the shaped and scored dough (on the flour/cornmeal dusted pan) in the preheated oven on the center rack. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Gently tap the loaves—if they sound hollow, the bread is done. For a more accurate test of doneness, the bread is done when an instant read thermometer inserted in the center reads 195°F (90°C)., Remove the bread from the oven and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Store leftovers loosely covered at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.","[('bread flour', 430.0, 'grams'), ('instant yeast', 6.0, 'grams'), ('coarse salt', 9.0, 'grams'), ('water', 360.0, 'milliliters')]"

Either in the bowl, or on an oiled counter, begin to stretch-and-fold the dough for a few minutes, until it begins to feel elastic and a little “bouncy.” Use a silicone dough scraper to help scoop the sides of the dough up as you work. This is messy work; expect the dough to remain sticky, though it will become more elastic and firm as you go., Shape the dough (40 mins), 1. Prepare your final proofing container: either a banneton basket or a medium bowl lined with a clean kitchen towel and sprinkled very liberally with flour., id=”instruction-step-4″>2. Pre-shape: Turn the dough onto a floured surface (sticky side up), then gently pull and stretch the dough from the bottom to the middle to create a ball shape, pinching the ends together in the middle to seal them together. If you prefer a batard or oblong shape, form the dough into a rough rectangle and fold one end halfway up the rectangle, then fold the other end in to meet it. Roll the dough into a rough log, using your fingertips to pinch together a seam along the length of the loaf and tuck and to seal the ends. Be careful to do this process gently so as not to deflate the gases that have allowed the dough to rise. Flip the dough over, cover with a tea towel, and rest for 30 mins., Final proof (2-12 hours), If baking immediately, allow the dough to prove at room temperature for two hours, or until it slowly springs back when poked. If time allows, I strongly recommend allowing a longer proof in the fridge for 8-12 hours. This allows the gluten to develop further and results in much better flavor., instruction-step-6″>1.

Cover with a damp cloth., Autolyse: let dough sit for one hour, covered and undisturbed., Bulk ferment: Now you will knead the salt that is sitting on top, into the dough for about 2 1/2 minutes. There is no precise way to do this, just think of working the dough through your hands and up against the bowl, push and pull. You will start to feel the dough relax a bit around 1 minute.

If the temperature in your home is above 72 degrees, this will be on the lower end; if it is cooler it will take on the longer end.

Turn the bowl and repeat this stretch and fold three more times until the salt and yeast are fully enclosed. Be careful not to pull so hard that you tear the dough.

Next, fold the dough over itself a few times. Repeat this several times until all of the ingredients are fully combined and there is some tension in the dough. Next, let the dough rest for a few minutes before folding for another 30 seconds or until the dough tightens up. This whole process should take about 4 minutes. Once complete, check the dough temperature. It should be 77-78 degrees for best results. Cover the bowl or tub and allow the dough to rise., Folding the dough: This dough bakes up best with three folds. Set a timer and begin 30 minutes after mixing the dough.

With your wet hand, reach underneath the dough and pull one quarter of it out and up to stretch it and then fold it over the top of the dough. Repeat this four to five times working around the dough until it has tightened up into a ball. Gently grab the whole ball and invert it so the seam side of the ball faces down. This will ensure the folds hold their position. The top of the dough will be smooth. After each fold, the dough will take longer to relax. Be extra gentle on the last fold so you do not deflate the dough. After completing the last fold, cover the dough and let it rise overnight at room temperature. In the morning, the dough should be 2 1/2 to 3 times its original volume. Now it’s ready to be divided., Divide the dough: Flour a flat work surface and with floured hands gently work the dough out of the bowl or tub onto the work surface. Be careful not to pull or tear the dough. Dust the middle of the dough mass with a bit of flour at the area where you will cut the dough in half. Using a large knife or dough scraper, cut the dough in two equal pieces., Shape the dough: Dust the inside of two proofing baskets with flour. The purpose of shaping the dough is to form a tight round while preserving the gases that have built up in the dough. It is these gases that create lovely air pockets in the loaf. Begin by brushing any loose flour off the top of the loaf. Using the same technique as in Step #3, stretch and fold one quarter of the dough at a time up and over the top to form a round, gently pulling each segment until you meet resistance and then folding it over the top to the opposite side. Repeat, working your way around the dough and forming a ball. Next, flip it over so the seam side is down on an area of the surface that is clean of flour so there is friction or tension on the surface. Finally, cup your hands around the back of the dough ball and pull the whole ball towards you on a dry, unfloured surface, about 6 to 8 inches at a time. Lead with your pinky fingers and be gentle but firm enough to create enough pressure that the dough ball doesn’t just slide across the countertop. You should feel the dough tighten up in a ball., Turn the dough a quarter turn and repeat this pull, turning and repeating until you’ve gone all the way around the dough ball two or three times. The dough ball should not be loose but does not need to be super tight either. The loaf should hold its shape. Repeat this process with the second dough ball and then place each piece seam side down in a proofing container that has been dusted with flour. Lightly flour the top of the shaped loaves and cover with a kitchen towel to proof., Proof the loaves: This is the final rise, after the loaf is shaped. For this bread, assume on baking it one hour and fifteen minutes after they are shaped, assuming the room temperature is about 70 degrees. If your kitchen is warmer, they will be proofed closer to one hour. To check that the dough has proofed completely, poke the rising loaf with a floured finger, making an indentation about 1/2 inch deep. If it springs back instantly, the loaf needs more proofing. If it springs back slowly and not fully, the loaf is proofed and ready to bake. If the indentation doesn’t spring back at all, the loaf is over proofed and will likely collapse when you remove it from the basket., Preheat: 45 minutes prior to baking, place a rack in the center of the oven and place 2 dutch ovens on the rack with the lids on. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. If you only have one dutch oven. place one ball of dough in the refrigerator 20 minutes before baking the first loaf and then bake the second loaf once the first loaf is done. Be sure to give the dutch oven a 5 minute reheat after removing the first loaf., Bake: Cut a piece of parchment paper wider than the size of the dutch oven. Invert the proofed loaf onto the parchment paper keeping in mind that the top of the loaf will be the seam side and the smooth side will now be on the bottom. Use oven mitts to carefully remove the hot dutch oven from the oven. Remove the lid and use the edges of the parchment paper to gently lift the dough up into the dutch oven. Use the mitts to replace the lid and return the dutch oven to the oven. Bake for 30 minutes. Carefully remove the lid and bake for 15 more minutes, until the loaf is a medium dark brown. Check you oven often to be sure the bread is not browning too quickly as all ovens heat differently. Remove the dutch oven and carefully turn the loaf out onto a cooling rack. Allow the loaf to rest for 15minutes before slicing.","[('white flour', 1000.0, 'grams'), ('water', 780.0, 'grams'), ('fine sea salt', 1.0, 'tbsp'), ('instant dried yeast', 1.0, 'tsp')]"

Mix them together briefly. Then add your rye flour, bread flour and salt and mix altogether with the end of a wooden spoon.The dough will be fairly shaggy and only just brought together. Cover your bowl with cling film or a damp tea towel and let it sit for around 1 hour. It's ok if it's a little bit longer, it's not going to matter too much.This process is called the ""autolyse"" and allows your flour to soak in all the water and become hydrated., Forming Up Your Dough:After the dough has been through autolyse you need to bring it together into a ball. You'll notice that the dough is fully hydrated after soaking all the water up. Work your way around the bowl, grabbing the dough from the outside, stretching it up and over itself until a rough ball is formed. You shouldn't need more than about 20-25 folds to form the ball (and remember that rye flour will make the dough stickier than you're used to).Once the dough has formed into a rough ball, pop the plastic wrap back on and let it rest for 30 minutes., Stretch & Folds:Over the next few hours you need to create some structure for your dough by ""stretching and folding"". Aim to do around 4-6 sets of stretches and folds. For each set, stretch the dough up and over itself 4 times. Leave around 15 minutes in between each set. Again you do not have to be exact with time, but you need to do at least 4 sets over 2 hours.You will need to really work the dough to develop the gluten - because rye flour has a lower gluten content.*if you want to add caraway seeds, add them during the second stretch and fold*, Bulk Ferment:Once you've finished your stretch and folds, place the plastic wrap or damp towel back over your dough and let it rest and ferment (see notes)., Shaping Your Dough:Once your dough has finished it's first ferment, it's time to form it back into a ball and give it some shape and surface tension. You'll need to flour your counter top with rice flour for this (we use rice flour because it has no gluten). Try to be quite sparing with the rice flour, you only need a very light dusting.Use a silicone dough scraper to gently ease the dough out of the bowl. You want it to land upside down on your counter so that the smooth top of the dough is on the countertop and the sticky underside is facing up. This will make it easier to shape.You can shape into whatever you like. I prefer this one as a boule but it also works well as a batard or even in a loaf pan., Once the dough is shaped into a tight ball, place it into your banneton smooth side down, so your seam is on the top - this way the top of your dough will get the pretty lines from the banneton. If you're using a cloth or tea towel in a bowl it's ok to put your dough with the smooth side up. Just make sure the dough is tight.Lift your dough around the edges to pop a little more rice flour if you feel it needs it. Just try to handle the dough as little as possible and be really gentle as you really want to preserve all the gases and air bubbles that have formed during your bulk ferment., You will need a banneton to put your dough into. If you do not have a banneton, then a bowl or basket lined with a floured tea towel is perfectly fine. Make sure your bowl isn't too big though, you want your dough to retain some shape.Whatever you're using needs to be liberally floured with your rice flour. If you're using a banneton - liberally sprinkle it with rice flour. If you're using a cloth or tea towel, rub the flour into it to ensure it becomes non stick., Cold Ferment:Now your dough is in it's ""shaping container"" cover it loosely with a plastic bag or damp tea towel and place into the fridge. I use a large plastic bag to cover it - I just reuse it each time. It's not totally essential to cover it - you can place it in the fridge uncovered if you'd prefer.Try to leave it in the fridge for a minimum 5 hours up to a maximum of around 36 hours. The longer you leave it the better your bread will be! A longer cold ferment creates beautiful blisters on your crust and a deeper sourdough flavour. It will also ensure your dough forms a skin which makes it easier to score., Preparing to Bake Your Sourdough:Once you're ready to bake your sourdough, you'll need to preheat your oven to 230C/450F. Place your Dutch Oven into the oven when you turn it on so it gets hot. Try to preheat for around 1 hour to ensure your oven is super hot - but you know your oven so just adjust this time if you need to.Leave your dough in the fridge until the very last minute - placing a cold dough into a hot oven will give you a great ""spring""., Baking Your Sourdough:When your oven is at temperature. Take your sourdough out of the fridge. Gently place it onto a piece of baking paper. Make sure that you make the baking paper big enough to use the edges as a handle to lower to dough into your Dutch Oven.Gently score your bread with a lame, clean razor blade or knife. Carefully take your dutch oven out of the oven. Place the sourdough into the pot using the baking paper as a handle. Put the lid on and place into the hot oven. If you want to you can spritz your dough with extra water before you put the lid on.BAKE TIME:30 Minutes with the lid on at 230C/450F plus10-15 Minutes with the lid off at 210C/410F, Finishing Your Bake:When you remove your dough from the oven, carefully remove it from the dutch oven as soon as possible and place on a wire rack to cool. You'll need to allow this bread a bit longer to cool due to its higher moisture content. It will take up to 12 hours for it to cool completely.","[('sourdough starter', 100.0, 'g'), ('bread flour', 250.0, 'g'), ('rye flour', 200.0, 'g'), ('water', 350.0, 'g'), ('molasses', 25.0, 'g'), ('salt', 10.0, 'g'), ('caraway seeds', 15.0, 'g')]"

Sprinkle the yeast on top and allow it to proof for a few minutes as you measure the remaining ingredients. Add the flour and salt to the bowl and stir until it is fully incorporated., Cover the bowl with a lid, clean kitchen towel, or piece of plastic wrap. Set the bowl in the refrigerator and allow it to rest for 2-4 hours. A longer proof in the refrigerator leads to a better tasting loaf. Two hours should be sufficient if the water was warm to the touch and the yeast was allowed to proof before adding the dry ingredients. You will know that the dough is ready to shape when it has risen slightly and has visible bubbles on the surface., Brush the bottom surface and sides of your cast iron skillet with Baking Pan Release Spread or add a light coating of cooking spray or neutral tasting oil., Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Sprinkle flour on a clean work surface. Remove the dough to the floured surface. The dough will be very sticky at first. Knead and turn the dough, shaping it into a ball as you go. Turn the dough a quarter turn with each kneading motion. Add more flour if necessary. The dough will quickly take shape and begin to lose its sticky texture. I usually knead it about 30 turns., Place the ball of dough in the middle of the prepared skillet. You can use a sharp knife to score the top of the loaf if you wish. Scoring the loaf will create a beautiful pattern on the baked loaf, but it isn't necessary to bake a delicious and beautiful loaf. Allow the dough to rest for around 30 minutes, While the bread is resting, prepare your oven or grill for baking by preheating to 420-425 degrees Fahrenheit., When the 30 minutes have elapsed and your oven or grill is holding temperature, transfer the skillet to the preheated oven/grill. Set a timer for 30 minutes., Unlike an oven, grills can vary in heat during the cooking period. So, when I am baking these loaves on the grill, I usually check the temperature by glancing at our grill’s thermometer every ten minutes or so. If your grill runs a bit hotter than you would like, open the lid, adjust the heat down slightly, and consider baking your loaf for a few minutes less if necessary. It will all come out delicious in the end, I promise., When 30 minutes have passed, the loaf should be brown and the top surface should be crisp.

An example of this folding technique is found here (halfway through the video). Cover the bowl again and let it rest for another hour, keeping the dough at 78-80ºF., Stretch & Fold #2: After an hour, uncover the bowl and repeat the series of three stretch and folds.

Cover the bowl again and let rest at a warm temperature 78-80ºF for one hour., Stretch & Fold #3: Uncover the bowl and repeat the series of three stretch and folds. This is your final set of stretch and folds. Cover the dough and let rest for another hour, keeping the dough warm 78-80ºF., At this point about 4 hours should have passed from the time you initially mixed the dough. The dough should have risen 30-40%, have some scattered bubbles over the top of the dough, pull away from the sides and start to dome toward the center and feel more elastic. If it doesn't look that way, let it keep fermenting for another 30 minutes and check again. Check your dough temperature and make sure your dough is in the 78-80ºF range., Cold Bulk Fermentation: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid and put it in the refrigerator to rest overnight. The dough can stay in the refrigerator for 12 to 48 hours.

Add the flours and salt. First, mix with a fork, the dough will be shaggy. Then mix by hand, mixing, folding and pushing the dough until the flour is fully incorporated and no dry bits are present. It will seem dry at first, but the more you work the dough, the more hydrated it will become. The dough will become moist and sticky and it will stick to your fingers as you go. Do this for about 3-4 minutes. Use the fork to scrape off the dough on your fingers as much as you can. Cover bowl with a damp tea towel. Set a timer for for 45 minutes and allow the dough to rest for 45 minutes. Now is a good time to feed/refresh your starter., Fold the Dough: After the dough has rested, fold the dough. To do this, grab a portion of the dough while it remains in the bowl, stretch it up and fold it over, pressing your fingertips into the center of the dough. You'll notice the dough is sticky and stretchy at this point. Repeat, until you've worked your way around the dough. This is the first fold, and you can stop here and begin bulk fermentation, but If time permits, and optimally, you'll want to repeat at least one to two more times as it improves the final dough's structure and crumb. Allow for about 45 minutes between folds., Bulk Fermentation (first rise): After the last fold, cover the bowl with two damp towels and allow to rise overnight at room temperature (see note** on optionally retarding the dough). This will take about 8-10 hours at 70 Fahrenheit (21 Celsius), but in a cooler kitchen the dough can take up to 12-14 hours to rise - this is the norm in my chilly kitchen at 68 Fahrenheit (18 Celsius). Use the time as a guide and not a determining factor. The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense, is jiggly when the bowl is wiggled, and has about doubled in size. You may see some bubbles on top of the dough., Shape the Dough: In the morning, and with damp fingertips, coax the dough into a floured work-surface. Pre Shape: With moist fingers, take a portion of the dough, gently stretch it towards you and fold it over towards the center, pressing it down gently. Repeat this process until you work all the way around the dough. Using a bench scraper flip the dough over, cover with a tea towel rest the dough for about 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, line a 10 inch oval banneton with a flour sack (as seen in the photos) or you can lightly dust the banneton with flour (I like to dust with white rice flour). Alternatively, you can use a 9 inch round banneton or bowl, following my Multigrain Sourdough Bread for shaping.Shape the Dough: Flour the work surface and using a bench scraper flip the dough back over. Use the photos in the blog post to help guide shaping. Gently shape the dough into a rough rectangle by gently dimpling the dough (think focaccia), to roughly 6-7 inches wide and 8-9 inches long. Fold the short side 2/3 over onto itself towards you and crease it firmly using the pinky side of your hand. Fold the bottom 1/3 piece up towards the crease and pinch the seam closed. Fold in the ends, coming in about an 3/4 inch - 1 inch and pinch the seam closed. Flip the bread over, seam sides down and rock it back and fourth a bit and gently fluff the ends in. Cover with a tea towel and allow the dough to rest for about 5-10 minutes. Using lightly floured hands and/or your bench scraper, cup the back of the dough and gently pull it towards you as needed until the surface is taught. Gently ""fluff"" the ends in again if needed to fit into the banneton. If not using a flour sack to line the banneton, sprinkle flour over the surface of the dough and smooth it around with the palm of your hand, covering the top and sides of the dough. Once the surface of the dough is taut and with one swift move, use the bench scraper to scoop the dough up and, place the dough into the prepared banneton - bottom side up., Proof the Dough (second rise): Cover the banneton with a damp tea towel and let rest for 30 minutes to 45 minutes. The dough is ready when it looks puffy and has risen slightly but has not doubled in size. Get Ready to Bake: Preheat the oven to 475 Fahrenheit (245 Celsius). Arrange an oven rack in the center of the oven and place a sheet pan on the bottom rack. This helps prevent a *too* dark bottom. Cut a sheet of parchment paper large enough to fit the size of your lidded baking vessel, I use a 10 Inch Cast Iron Skillet with Deep Dish Skillet for a lid. Crumble the parchment paper, then uncrumble the parchment, and smooth it open for easier handling., Score: To turn the dough out of the banneton, place the parchment over the dough and invert the banneton to release onto the parchment. Using the tip of a lame or a razor blade, score the dough about 1/2 inch (8 millimeters) deep, off center, in an gentle arch shape the length of the dough or any way you like. Use the parchment to transfer the dough to the baking vessel and place the lid on the vessel., Bake the Dough: Place the vessel into the oven, on the center rack, and bake for 30 minutes at 475 Fahrenheit (245 Celsius) with the lid on. Remove the lid, reduce the oven temperature to 450 Fahrenheit (232 Celsius) and continue baking for another 10-15 minutes tenting the loaf with foil if it starts getting too dark (my ear always gets extra dark).The bread is ready when the internal temperature of the loaf is between 190 - 205 Fahrenheit (87 - 96 Celsius). When done, transfer the bread to a wire rack. Cool completely before slicing., Storage Notes: Sourdough is best consumed on the same day it's baked, but it lasts for 3-4 days stored at room temperature. Store at room temperature cut side down.This bread freezes beautifully. Store baked bread, sliced, in a freezer bag either whole or sliced for up to two weeks. Thaw at room temperature.

If the dough is too sticky to handle, sprinkle a light amount of flour over the surface, adding more as needed to handle/shape the dough., Stretch and fold: Grasp the dough at the top (think 12 o’clock, if the dough were a clock face) and stretch it over the bottom (6 o’clock). Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat. Repeat this step two more times for a total of 4 stretch and folds. I demonstrate this in the photos above and in the video, if a visual helps!, Use your hands to form the dough into a ball again (don't be afraid to shape it, you want it to be more round than flat!), place on a large piece of parchment paper (the parchment should be large enough that you can lift it up and lower it into a Dutch oven), and lightly cover with plastic wrap., Allow dough to rest, covered, for 30 minutes.

Turn the bowl 45 degrees again, stretch and fold. One last time, turn the bowl, stretch and fold. So to recap you are doing four stretch and folds around the bowl for one series., Cover the dough with the kitchen towel and let it rest for 15 minutes. Repeat 3-5 more times till dough is more firm., Cover the dough with a damp kitchen towel to keep the moisture in and let the dough rest in a warm (not too hot) area until it has doubled in size. This may take between 8-12 hours depending on the temperature of your home and the strength of your sourdough starter., Once it has doubled in size, you can shape the dough., Keep a small bowl of water nearby. You will need to wet your hands slightly to work with the dough., Scoop your dough out onto a clean surface. It does not need to be floured to work with the dough since your hands are slightly wet. *note: if you have doubled the recipe, this is when you will divide the dough into two equal pieces using a bench scraper or sharp knife. Follow the remaining instructions for both pieces of dough., Stretch the dough out onto your clean work surface into a thin stretched out rectangle. Tri-fold the dough over on itself like you would a hand towel, so that it forms a long thin rectangle., Fold the dough onto itself lengthwise of the rectangle creating a dough ball., Begin to roll your dough into a tighter ball by pushing with the heel of your dominant hand along the work surface and then pulling it back towards you with the fingers of your dominant hand. Repeat the push pull motion for a minute or two until the dough ball is holding its shape., You may need to repeat the folding and push-pull after letting the dough rest for a few minutes if it seems like it is not holding the shape well., After you have shaped the dough, place it in a banneton bread proofing basket. Line the basket with linen dusted with flour for a smooth finish, or just the banneton basket dusted with flour to get those pretty rings on the dough., Cover the dough with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours. When the dough is in the fridge, this slows down the rise of the dough and adds flavor. It will also give the dough that nice crispy crust when you bake it later.

Cover the pan and proof at 75°F/24°C for 1 hour., After 1 hour, you want to perform the first coil fold. With wet hands, slide both hands under the dough in the center until your fingertips touch. Slowly lift the dough up and towards you until the dough lets go of the bowl. Fold the dough underneath itself by lowering your hands. Turn the bowl 180° and do the other side. Turn the bowl 90° and repeat (basically folding all four sides)., Repeat the folding every hour for the first 3-4 hours of proofing. Leave the dough untouched for the remaining hour(s).

At this point, the dough needs to be quite sticky. Stir in the chopped olives and ensure that they are equally distributed throughout the batter. (Alternatively, you can use your clean hands to mix and feel the stickiness.), Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let it sit in a warmer part of your house for 18-24 hours.In my tests, I found that the bread baked after 18 hours of rising time was perfect, but the 24-hour one was also good. One important thing to mention here is that at the end of the rising time you might see a thin (kind of hard - for the lack of a better word) layer at the top of the dough. Don’t be alarmed by that. In the next step, we will fold that into the dough and since it is a sticky one, the additional rising time will help soften it., Lightly flour a piece of parchment paper, gently remove the dough from the bowl, and place it onto the parchment. While removing, you will realize that it is quite sticky. However, if you take your time and gently pull it by folding it onto itself, you will see that it will come out easily without any dough remaining in the bowl. For a visual, be sure to watch the video below., Form the dough into a ball tucking the sides of the dough under. Lightly dust it with a little bit of flour, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.

Mix together until all the flour is moistened., Let the dough sit, covered, for 20 minutes to hydrate and autolyze. (Use a timer to keep track of the time.), Add the sugar and salt and knead the dough for nine minutes at medium speed., Remove the dough and grease the inside of the bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Put the dough back in, cover the bowl, and let the dough rise at 85°F (29°C) until doubled in volume, about 90 minutes., Braid the bread, Turn the bread out on a countertop. Do not flour the countertop! You need the friction of the bare counter to help keep the strands in place while braiding., Divide the dough into four equal parts and roll them all out into strands about 14–16 inches long., Pinch all four strands together at one end and number the positions, 1–4., Cross strand 4 over strand 2., Cross strand 1 over strand 3., Cross strand 2 over strand 3., Repeat the pattern until you run out of dough. Pinch the strands together and tuck them under the loaf., Place the loaf on a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover it loosely with plastic wrap that has been oiled on the contact side., Set the loaf aside to proof in a place that is as close to 85°F (29°C) as possible., Allow the loaf to rise until it no longer springs back easily or fully when poked, about 2–3 hours., Bake, When the bread is done proofing, or nearly so, preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C)., Make the egg wash by beating together the egg, the pinch of salt, and a teaspoon of water., Brush the egg wash onto the surface of the loaf.

Stir in the oil and 4 of the eggs (reserve 1 egg for an egg wash after braiding), with the remaining sugar and salt. Gradually add the flour, 1 cup at a time, to make a soft dough. My standard-size KitchenAid mixer can't quite handle this much dough so I pretty much always finish kneading by hand by turning the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and kneading until smooth., Clean out and lightly oil the bowl before returning the dough to it. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the challah dough rise in a warm, draft-free spot for about an hour, until almost doubled in size. Punch the dough down (literally, just stick your fist right into the center of the dough and push it down), then cover it with plastic wrap and let it rise again for another half hour., To form the 6-strand challah braid, first divide the dough on a clean surface. Divide it in half to make two loaves. Then divide each half into 6 equally sized portions and roll the balls of dough into 6 equally sized strands, each about 16 inches long. Place the strands side by side and pinch the tops together., Starting with the outside right strand, move it over 2 strands to the left. Then take the second strand from the left and move it all the way across to the far right. Next, take the outside left strand and move it over 2 strands to the right. Then move the second strand from the right over to the far left. Repeat the pattern by starting again with the outside right strand being moved over 2 strands to the left, and so on until you have a long, braided loaf., Tuck the end of the braid underneath the loaf to secure it. Your braid is likely to be fairly long and skinny at this point, and that's completely normal. To finish shaping the loaf, you need to plump it a bit into more of a loaf shape by sort of lifting and smooshing the braid in on itself a bit and wiggling it a bit to make the loaf a bit shorter, wider, and even from top to bottom. The braid shouldn't come undone - you are just evening out the shape here to make your loaf look nice. This step can be done as you are transferring the braid from the surface where you formed it onto a parchment-lined baking sheet., Repeat steps 4 & 5 with the remaining half of the dough for the second loaf. Place the braided loaves on a parchment-lined baking sheet pan, with at least 2 inches in between the braids so they don't meld together as they rise. Beat the remaining egg and brush half of it on loaves using a pastry brush. Be sure to get in the crevices of the braid and down the sides of the loaves. Allow the loaves to rise another hour in a warm place, then brush again with the remainder of the egg wash. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, if using them (I almost always skip them, but it would make the loaf even more traditional)., Preheat the oven to 375 degrees then bake the challah for 30-35 minutes until golden brown (or when the internal temperature of the bread reaches 190 degrees on an instant-read thermometer).

Combine the yeast mixture into the bowl. Using a hand mixer, mix until just combined. Once absorbed, add the egg whites and beat on medium-high for approximately 3 minutes. Add in most of the oats in the last 30 seconds. The dough will be wet and a tacky. Spray the loaf pan with non-stick spray. Pour the dough into the loaf pan. Add the remaining oats on the top of the bread. Note, that you want the mixture to come up about 3/4 to a little higher in the loaf pan. Find a warm spot in your kitchen and let the loaf proof until it gets to just below the bottom of the loaf pan. This will take anywhere from one to three hours.

Stir with a fork. Sift the bread flour and cocoa powder together and add to the bowl. Squish everything together with your hands until all of the flour is absorbed. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest (autolyse) for 1 hour. Note: use this time to soak the raisins in a splash of vanilla extract for extra flavor (optional). Drain and pat dry before using., To the dough, Add the salt, walnuts, raisins and chocolate chips. Lift and fold the dough over itself several times and squish with your hands to incorporate. The dough will tear slightly as you fold. Don’t worry- this is normal. Work the dough as best you can until it comes back together into a rough ball., Bulk Rise, Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel. Leave it in a warm spot to rise. Your dough is ready when it no longer looks dense and has increased in volume about 1½- 2x its original size. This can take anywhere from 10 hrs @ 68 F; 5-6 hrs @ 75 F; 3-4 hrs @ 80 F depending on the temperature of your ingredients, the potency of your starter and surrounding environment (**see notes below). Optional Step: about 30 minutes into the start of the bulk rise, you can stretch and fold the dough., Stretch & fold: To strengthen your dough, do a series of stretch and folds every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours of bulk fermentation. Simply gather a portion of the dough, stretch it upwards and then fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl ¼ turn and repeat until you have come full circle. You will have completed 4 folds. Try to keep the fillings tucked into the dough and not on the outside. This will prevent burning when baked., Shape the Dough, To cut and shape the dough, divide your work surface in half; lightly flour one side (for cutting) and leave the other half clean (for shaping). Remove the dough from the bowl and place onto the floured section. You do not need to ‘punch down’ the dough; it will gently deflate as you fold and shape it. Cut the dough in half to make 2 loaves, or leave it whole for a single loaf. To shape, use a bench scraper to move your dough to the non-floured section (if there is any flour present it will be difficult to shape- brush away any excess). Gather the dough, one side at a time, and fold it into the center. Flip the dough over and place it seam side down. Using your hands, gently cup the sides of the dough and rotate it using quarter turns in a circular motion. You can also pull it towards you to even out its shape. Repeat this process until you are happy with its appearance., Second Rise, Place the dough into a cloth lined 8-inch bowl or floured/lined proofing basket. It will need to rise again, about 30 minutes to 1 hour. It is ready when the dough is slightly puffy, but not double in size., Towards the end of the second rise preheat your oven to 400 F. Cut a sheet of non-stick parchment paper to fit the size of your baking pot, leaving enough excess around the sides to remove the bread., Score the Dough, Place the parchment over the dough and invert the bowl to release. Using the tip of a bread lame, small, serrated knife or a razor blade, make four shallow 4-inch long cuts at 3, 6, 9, and 12 o’clock around the dough. Use the parchment paper to transfer the dough to the baking pot., Bake the Dough, Place your bread into the oven (lid on) and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the lid, and continue to bake (uncovered) for an additional 40 minutes. During the last 10 minutes of baking, crack open the oven door. This allows the moisture to escape, leaving your bread with a crisp crust. You can also take the internal temperature of your bread to double check that it is done. For sourdough, it should read about 205 F., Cool, Remove the bread from the oven, and cool on a wire rack for at least an hour before slicing.

Add the flour and salt. Squish everything together with your hands until all of the flour is absorbed. The dough will be dry and shaggy. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, reusable wrap or a clean, very damp kitchen towel. Let rest (autolyse) for 30 minutes or up to 1 hour, if preferred., After the dough has rested, work the dough in the bowl into a rough ball, about 15 seconds., Bulk Rise, Now the dough needs to rise., Cover the bowl with wrap or a very damp kitchen cloth. Let rest in a warm spot to rise. The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense and has doubled in size. This can take anywhere from 3-12 hours depending on the temperature of your ingredients, the potency of your starter and surrounding environment. For example, in the summer rise times can take anywhere between 2-4 hours @ 85º F/ 29º C whereas in the winter, the dough will take about 10-12 hours @ 68º F/ 20º C., Optional Step: Stretch & Fold the Dough, During bulk rise, you have the option to perform a series of ‘stretch & folds’ to strengthen the dough. Start 30 minutes into the bulk rise. Gather a portion of the dough, stretch it upwards and then fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl ¼ turn and repeat this process until you have come full circle to complete 1 set. Do this once or twice spaced about an hour apart. Although this step is not mandatory, it will increase the total volume and height of your bread. Click here for a step-by-step video tutorial., Cut & Shape the Dough, Divide your work surface in half; lightly flour one side (for cutting) and leave the other half clean (for shaping)., Remove the dough from the bowl, and place onto the floured section so that it does not stick. You do not need to ‘punch down’ the dough; it will gently deflate as you fold and shape it., Cut the dough in half to make 2 loaves, or leave it whole for a single loaf., To shape, use a bench scraper to move your dough to the non-floured section (if there is any flour present, it will be difficult to shape- brush away any excess). Starting at the top, fold the dough over toward the center. Give it a slight turn, and then fold over the next section of dough. Repeat until you have come full circle., Then flip the dough over and place it seam side down. Using your hands, gently cup the sides of the dough and rotate it, using quarter turns in a circular motion. You can also pull it towards you to even out the shape. Repeat this process until you are happy with its appearance. *See note below., Second Rise, Now the dough needs to rise again, but for a shorter period of time., Coat the bottom of your Dutch oven with cornmeal. Alternatively, use parchment paper to prevent sticking (this is what I do, now). Place the dough inside for a second shorter rise, about 30 minutes to 1 hour and cover with the lid of the pot or a very damp cloth. The dough ready when it is slightly puffy but not double in size., Preheat your oven to 450º F/ 232º C towards the tail end of the second rise., Score the Dough, Right before your bread goes into the oven, make a shallow slash about 2-3 inches long (or more) in the center of the dough. Use a bread lame, sharp pairing or a small serrated steak knife. The cut should be about 1/4-inch deep., Bake the Dough, Place the bread into the oven on the center rack (lid on) and reduce the temperature to 400° F/ 204° C. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the lid, and continue to bake (uncovered) for an additional 40 minutes or until deep, golden brown. Keep in mind that all ovens are different; you might have to make minimal adjustments to these temperatures., You can also take the internal temperature of your bread to double check that it is done. For sourdough, it should read about 205-210º F/ 96-98º C., Remove the bread from the oven, and cool on a wire rack for at least an hour before slicing.

Add 50 grams water and stir with a spatula until combined. Cover the bowl with a tea towel or cloth bowl cover and set aside for 3 to 4 hours or until the dough’s surface is dimpled with holes., Make the dough, To the bowl of the poolish, add the water. The sponge should release from the bowl and parts of it, if not all of it, will float. Add the salt and stir briefly. Add the flour, and stir until you have a wet, sticky dough ball — dough will be very sticky. Cover with a tea towel or cloth bowl cover and let sit for 30 minutes., Stretches and folds, : With wet hands, grab one side of the dough, and pull up and to the center. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn, and repeat the grabbing and pulling. Do this until you’ve made a full circle. (Watch the video for more guidance. I employ a “slap-and-fold” technique, which is helpful when handling these wet doughs.) Cover the bowl. If time permits, repeat this process three more times at 30-minute intervals for a total of 4 sets of stretches and folds over the course of two hours. If you are short on time, know that doing just one or two sets of stretches and folds is totally fine., Let it rise, Transfer the dough to a straight-sided vessel, if you have one, or leave it in the bowl if you don’t. Cover the vessel with a towel and let rise until doubled in volume. Punch down (deflate) the dough — if your dough is still in the bowl, you can deflate it using wet hands right in the bowl; if your dough is in a straight-sided vessel, it may be easier to turn the dough out onto a work surface and ball it up using wet hands to prevent sticking. Return the dough to the vessel, cover it with an airtight lid, and transfer it to the refrigerator immediately for at least 12 hours. The dough can remain in the fridge for as long as 48 hours., Portion and shape, (Note: This is where I deviate from traditional ciabatta bread recipes. See notes in the post above for the more traditional shaping method.) Turn the dough out onto a work surface. I prefer to do this step without flour, but absolutely sprinkle your surface lightly with flour as needed to make the dough manageable to work with. Using a bench scraper or your hands, shape the dough into a tight ball; then use the bench scraper to divide the dough in half. If you want perfectly even balls, each portion will way roughly 455 grams. Again, use the bench scraper or your hands to ball up each portion into a tight ball — see video for guidance., Proof, Sprinkle your countertop liberally with flour. Place the balls top-side (smooth side) down onto the flour. The seam-side will be on top now, and it may split open — this is fine. Sprinkle the top surface of the balls liberally with flour. Cover with a tea towel and let rest for 2.5 hours. After 2 hours of proofing, heat the oven to 425ºF., Line a sheet pan with parchment paper, When the dough has finished proofing, gently flip each ball over — I find a bench scraper to be helpful here.

Begin to mix, using a rubber scraper or the dough hook on your stand mixer. Add the flour one cup at a time, reserving the last cup of flour to see if you need it. You might not use all of the flour. The dough should pull away and clean the bowl, sticking on the bottom in a small circle about the size of a quarter. If your dough does this with just 5 cups of flour, do not add more. However, if your dough still sticks to the bowl, add more a couple tablespoons at a time until it cleans the bowl, sticking in just a small circle on the bottom., Now knead dough for 7 minutes. Set a timer as a full knead is important! Place in a well oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise in a warm area until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour., Punch dough down. Knead for 1 minute and divide dough in half. Shape into loaves and place into two greased 9x5 inch loaf pans.

Let this stand until the yeast is dissolved. Gradually add the flour, one cup at a time to the liquid and mix thoroughly until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface to knead. (This may be a little messy, but don't give up!), Knead It: Fold the far edge of the dough back over on itself towards you. Press into the dough with the heels of your hands and push away. After each push, rotate the dough 90°. Repeat this process in a rhythmic, rocking motion for 5 minutes, sprinkling only enough flour on your kneading surface to prevent sticking. Let the dough rest while you scrape out and grease the mixing bowl with a few drops of olive oil (preferred) or non stick baking spray. Knead the dough again for 2 to 3 minutes., Let It Rise: Return the dough to the bowl and turn it over once to grease the top. Cover with a damp towel and keep warm until the dough doubles in bulk, about 1 to 2 hours., Shape it: Punch down the dough with your fist and briefly knead out any air bubbles.

If hardly any sticks to your fingers it’s just right. If it is dry and crumbly with pockets of visible flour, it has too much flour. Kneading the dough for a few extra minutes can help hydrate any excess flour., Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes. Cover with a clean kitchen towel or with a bowl lid or with plastic wrap.

Boil as many as you are comfortable with boiling. Once the bagels are in, it shouldn’t take too long for them to float to the top (a couple seconds). Let them sit there for 1 minute, and then flip them over to boil for another minute. Extend the boiling times to 2 minutes each, if you’d prefer a chewier bagel (results will give you a more New York-Style bagel with this option)., If you want to add toppings to your bagels, do so as you take them out of the water. Alternatively, you can use an egg wash to get the toppings to stick before baking the bagels. You may want to use the “Optional Toppings” listed above to top the bagels.

Add a piece of tape near your starter line so you can track the growth. Set the starter in a warmer area of the house., Make Sourdough Dough, 12:00 to 1:00 pmAdd the weighed activated starter and water to a large bowl and mix well. Mix in the weighed organic bread flour. You may have to use your hands to combine the ingredients. Add the salt (make sure to add it last, so it does not interfere with the starter.) At this point, the mixture will be very sticky and hard to form. Cover with a wet towel, and set it aside for one hour., Refeed Starter Jar, 1:15 pmAfter making your sourdough, feed your starter jar, and place it back in the refrigerator if you do not plan to bake for a few days. If you plan to bake bread the next day, you can leave it out on the counter., Stretch and Fold | First Rise, 2:00 pmWet your hands. Fold and stretch your dough until it forms a large ball. You can do this without bringing your dough onto the countertop. I usually do this step with the dough in the bowl the entire time. (refer to the video for help) Once the dough is formed into a ball, cover it back up with a damp cloth and set it aside for three to five hours. It should double in size at this point. Keep your dough in a warm house (67 to 73.) I have often placed the bread in the oven to rise with the light on., Stretch, Fold, Shape & Cool Proof, 6:00 pm Remove the dough from the bowl. Divide the dough into two equal parts. I use a scale to ensure the separated dough weighs the same; otherwise, baking times will change for each loaf. It’s ok if they are a few grams off. Add a little flour to your surface, stretch and fold, and then shape each sourdough into a tight ball. Add flour to the banneton, and place the dough smooth side down into the banneton(proofing basket.) Cover and place in the refrigerator overnight. The longer it proofs in the refrigerator, the bolder the flavor will become. If you want to add fillers like cheese, cinnamon, raisins, etc., do this during the last stretch and fold. You can leave the proofing sourdough in the refrigerator for up to 36 hours, so if you want to bake the bread when you get home the next day instead of the morning, that will work too!, Scoring, 5:30 am (next day) Preheat oven to 475 degrees.Remove the proofed sourdough from the refrigerator. Transfer the dough to a sheet of parchment paper (smooth side up.) Dust with flour, and use your fingers to smooth the surface. Use scissors, a knife, or a scoring tool to add fun designs. Slice the dough about 1/2 inch thick on the top before placing it into the oven. This will form a stunning “ear” on the sourdough bread., Baking Bread, 6:00 amBake your sourdough bread.Place the bread (still on top of parchment paper) into a dutch oven with a lid. Bake for 50 minutes. Remove the lid, and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Remember that all ovens cook differently, pay attention to the bread once you remove the lid.

Dough will be soft., Knead the dough:, Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if using the paddle) and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test., 1st Rise, Shape the kneaded dough into a ball. Place the dough in a greased bowl (I use nonstick spray to grease) and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place in a slightly warm environment to rise until doubled in size, around 60-90 minutes. (If desired, use my warm oven trick for rising. See my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.), As the dough rises, prepare the filling in the next step and grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan., Make the filling, In a medium bowl, mix the soft butter, rosemary, parsley, garlic, and salt together. If the butter is soft enough, you can just mix it all together with a spoon or fork. You can use an electric mixer if that’s easier too. Cover tightly and set aside until ready to use. (Don’t refrigerate unless making well in advance. It’s easiest to spread on the dough when at room temperature. If refrigerated, let it come to room temperature before spreading on dough pieces.), Assemble the bread:, Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface. Divide it into 12 equal pieces, each about 1/4 cup of dough and a little larger than a golf ball. Using lightly floured hands, flatten each into a circle that’s about 4 inches in diameter. The circle doesn’t have to be perfectly round. I do not use a rolling pan to flatten, but you certainly can if you want. Spread 1-2 teaspoons of filling mixture onto each. Sprinkle each with 1 Tablespoon of cheese. Fold circles in half and line in prepared baking pan, round side up. See photos above for a visual., truction-step-8"">2nd Rise, 2nd Rise, Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rise once again in a slightly warm environment until puffy, about 45 minutes., Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position then preheat oven to 350°F (177°C)., Bake until golden brown, about 50 minutes. If you find the top of the loaf is browning too quickly, tent with aluminum foil. (Don’t be alarmed if there’s melted butter around the sides of the bread as it bakes, it will seep into the bread before it finishes.) Remove from the oven and place the pan on a wire rack. If desired, brush with melted butter for topping and sprinkle with sea salt., Cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then remove from the pan and serve warm., Cover and store leftovers at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Heat to 110° F for active dry yeast and 120° F if using rapid rise yeast. Stir in all the yeast. Let sit for 10 minutes. Yeast should become a foamy. If it does not foam, it is dead and you need to start over., Transfer the yeast mixture to the stand mixer bowl if kneading by machine and a regular mixing bowl if kneading by hand. Add butter, sugar, salt, and 6 1/2 cups of flour in increments (3 1/4 cups for a half recipe). Stir with a wooden spoon or by hand until the mixture becomes a shaggy dough. Then it’s time to knead., Kneading by stand mixer: Place the bowl onto the stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Start with the mixer on low. After 1 minute of mixing, if the dough does not start to clear the side of the bowl, add a couple tablespoons of flour at a time until it starts to pull away from the sides. Allow the flour to incorporate before adding more. You should need to add the max of one cup. My stand mixer requires dough to be kneaded on low (speed 2). If your stand mixer does not not have the low speed restriction, increase to medium a this point. Knead for 6 to 8 minutes total, or until the dough becomes smooth, elastic, and springs back when poked. If poking leaves a indentation in the dough, it needs more kneading. (See Note ** below.), Kneading by hand: Turn the dough onto a floured work surface. Lightly flour the top of the dough. Gather into an oval mass with the pointy ends at 12 o’clock and 6 o’clock. Fold the 12 o’clock end over to the 6 o’clock end (using a plastic bench scraper would help if the dough is overly sticky). Using the heel of your hand, press on the lower end of the dough with a downward and forward motion. Turn the dough a quarter turn. Fold the 12 o’clock end over to the 6 o’clock end again. Then repeat pressing downward and away from you. Continue to kneading in this manner for 8-10 minutes. As you continue to knead, add a small amount of flour, as needed, if the dough feels too wet and sticky. The max amount you might need to add is 1 cup total. The dough is properly kneaded when it becomes smooth, elastic, and springs back when poked. If poking leaves a indentation in the dough, it needs more kneading. (See Note ** below.), Fermentation (1st rise), Transfer the dough into a generously large greased bowl. Turn the dough around to coat with oil. Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Allow to rest and double in size at room temperature for approximately 1 hour if using rapid rise yeast and 2 hours for active dry yeast., To shape dough:, Gently press punch down dough to release some air. Divide into 2 equal pieces. Working with one piece at a time, press gently to to form a rough rectangle with the short side no wider than 8-inches., Stretch out the corners of one of the short sides to form flaps. Fold them back towards center so that the top edge of the flaps meet vertically at the center line to form a point at the top of the rectangle. The outline of the dough should resemble a shape of a house. Use the heel of your hand to press down the seam to seal., Fold the pointed tip over the seam and press to seal the new seam., Repeat stretching the corners out, folding, sealing (steps 7-8) two more times. You should still have some unrolled dough at this point., Roll the dough log-style onto itself. When you are within an inch or so of the edge, cup your hand over the log while pressing into the bottom edge of the log roll with the heel of your hand to seal the seam. Then roll the log to the edge of the dough., Grease the bottom and sides of two 8.5 x 4.5 x 2.5-inch loaf pans. Place the dough, seam side down in the loaves. Press down gently with your hand to distribute the dough to fill the pan. Cover loosely with a lightly greased plastic wrap. Shape the other half of the dough., See Note*** below for shaping alternative., Proofing (2nd rise):, Proof dough at room temperature until the dough doubles in size and rises about 1-inch over the pans. This takes about 1 hour if using rapid rise yeast and 2 hours if using active dry yeast., Baking:, Preheat the oven to 350° F 10 minutes before the dough is ready to bake., Whisk egg and water in a small bowl. Brush egg wash onto the top of the loaves. Bake on the center rack for 35-45 minutes. Mine are usually done in 35 minutes. The internal temperature should be 190°-200° F., Allow to cool in loaf pans for 5 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack. Brush the top with butter to keep crust soft (optional).

Complete this step before you start dipping in butter because if your hands are greasy, the rolls won't stay intact., Dip each biscuit ball in butter and garlic mixture. Some of the garlic should adhere to the rolls as you do this. As you start to run low on the butter, more of the garlic will stick, so don't worry if it doesn't as much at the beginning. Roll each ball in desired coating and arrange the biscuits in the pan so the various coatings are alternated., Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until biscuits are done and surface is golden.

4a193abc,https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2020/06/whole-wheat-sourdough-bread/,Light Whole Wheat Sourdough Bread,"50g bubbly, active sourdough starter (100% hydration), 350g – 375g warm water (80-85 F)* See note below, 400g bread flour, 100g whole wheat flour, 9g fine sea salt","Baking Schedule, Whole whether doughs tend to rise faster than white doughs, especially in warm weather. To avoid over proofed dough, I like to start mixing in the afternoon (usually between 2-3 PM) when I know I’ll be home to stretch and fold the dough. Please adjust your rise times based on temperature., Make the Dough, Combine the sourdough starter and water in a large bowl. Add the flour and salt. Mix with a fork and then finish by hand to fully incorporate the flour. It will feel very wet and sticky. Cover with a damp towel or wrap and let rest for 1 hour on your countertop, returning to the bowl after the first 30 minutes to work the dough into a rough ball., Bulk Rise with Stretch and Folds, After the dough has rested for 1 hour, do your first fold., Gather a portion of the dough, stretch it upward, and fold it over toward the center of the bowl. Give the bowl a 1/4 turn and repeat 3 more times, stretch and folding the dough to come full circle around the bowl (4 folds = 1 set). If the dough still feels slack after the 1st set, do an additional 4 folds around the bowl to tighten the dough., For best results, do 4 sets total spaced 30 minutes apart resting the covered dough in a warm spot in between each set (see tip below). Notice how the dough will tighten after the 4th set. See video for technique., When finished with the folds, cover the bowl and continue the bulk rise (untouched) at 75-78 F for about for 2-3 hours. The dough is ready when it has almost doubled in size. Wrap and chill the whole bowl overnight; the dough will continue to rise only slightly in the fridge when the dough is warm., How to Create Warm Spot for Bread Dough, Preheat your home oven to the lowest setting for 30- 45 seconds and then shut it off. Place the covered bowl of dough inside to bulk up. The temperature should be 75-78 F and no higher than 80 F. Use an oven thermometer (and common sense) to keep track of the temperature. Dough that is too warm will become wet, sticky, and a tricky to work with. Alternatively, I highly recommend using a proofing box., Shape the Dough, The following morning, make sure the dough has doubled in size. If not, give it more time to bulk up, if needed. This is important to build strength., Line a small bowl (or proofing basket) with a cotton or linen cloth. Sprinkle with flour. You’re going to shape the dough twice to build extra strength., Preshape, Remove the cold dough onto a floured surface. Let rest for 10-15 minutes to take some of the chill off. Shape the dough into a loose ball using the envelope technique. Starting at the top of the dough, stretch and fold it over toward the center. Then stretch and fold the bottom of the dough toward the center. Repeat on the left side…and then the right side. Using a bench scraper, scoop up the dough and flip it over so the smooth side is facing up. Cover and rest for 20-30 minutes., Final Shape, After the dough has rested, flip it over again (the smooth side should be facing down now). Shape it again following the steps above. Flip it back over. With floured hands, gently cup the dough and pull it toward you in a circular motion to tighten its shape. Place the dough into the lined bowl or proofing basket seam side up. Cover with the cloth overhang., Second Rise, Rest in the warm spot you used earlier for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The dough is ready when it looks puffy and has risen slightly, but has not yet doubled in size. The dough should not be very cold prior to baking., Preheat your oven to 450 towards the tail end of the second rise., Cut a sheet of non-stick parchment paper to fit the size of your baking pot, leaving enough excess around the sides to remove the bread., Score the Dough, Place the parchment over the dough and invert the bowl to release. Sprinkle the dough with flour and gently rub the surface with your hands. Using the tip of a bread lame, small, serrated knife or a razor blade, make four shallow 4-inch long cuts at 3, 6, 9, and 12 o’clock around the dough. Use the parchment paper to transfer the dough to a Dutch oven (or another oven safe pot with lid)., Bake the Dough, Bake the dough on the center rack for 20 minutes, covered. Remove the lid, and continue to bake for 40 minutes and golden brown., When finished, transfer to a wire rack. Cool for 1 hour before slicing, for best texture.","[('sourdough starter', 50.0, 'g'), ('warm water', 350.0, 'g'), ('warm water', 375.0, 'g'), ('bread flour', 400.0, 'g'), ('whole wheat flour', 100.0, 'g'), ('fine sea salt', 9.0, 'g')]"
670fbbd8,https://www.breadandbasil.nyc/sourdough/light-whole-wheat-sourdough,Light Whole Wheat Sourdough Bread,"400 grams bread flour, 100 grams whole wheat flour, 400 grams room temperature water, 100 grams sourdough starter (ripe/mature/fed), 10 grams kosher salt","Place your mixing bucket or bowl on a scale and “tare” to 0 grams. Add sourdough starter and water. Stir thoroughly to break up the starter within the water. Add the flour and mix until no dry spots remain; this might take a little bit of effort. Cover the container and allow the dough to rest for 45 minutes., After 45 minutes, the dough will appear much more elastic, but still be sticky to the touch. Sprinkle the salt over the top of the dough, and then with wet hands, begin to fold the dough over itself to incorporate the salt. To do this, leave the dough in the bowl and pick up one “side” of the mass. Stretch it up as long as it will go without breaking, then fold it over the top of the dough. Repeat on the opposite side, this time folding the bottom up and over. Now repeat with the right and left sides of the dough. Continue to do this action, called the “stretch and fold” for 2-3 minutes to incorporate the salt and begin to develop strength in the dough. Cover the container and allow the dough to rest for another 30 minutes., For the next 2 hours, you will repeat the stretch and fold action every 30 minutes for a total of 4-5 sets of stretch and folds. With each set, it should be a little bit more difficult to stretch the dough up and over as far. The dough will tighten up into a ball after each fold, and then relax back to the shape of the container during the 30 minute rest., To test if the dough has developed sufficient strength, perform the windowpane test. To do this, stretch a small section of dough up away from the surface and spread it between two fingers. If you can see light pass through the dough without it breaking or tearing, your dough has developed enough gluten. 4 sets of folds should do it, but if you need to add in another set, feel free to do so following the same 30 minute rest pattern. NOTE: Because this is whole wheat dough, you will need to be gentle when stretching the dough to prevent the wheat bran from tearing through the gluten., Once the dough passes the windowpane test, cover the mixing container and allow the dough to rise without disturbing it until light, with bubbles visible on the surface. If you have a clear mixing container, you will also see bubbles all throughout the bottom and sides of the dough. The dough will gain volume and become and 1.5 to 1.75 times bigger in size (if the dough gets much bigger, it may over-ferment and be hard to shape). This step can vary in time and may finish be between 4-6 hours from when you first mix the dough in Step 1., Very lightly dust a counter with rice or all-purpose flour. Using a wet hand, coax the dough away from the sides of your mixing container until it easily pulls away and gently dump the dough onto your floured surface. Using the same motion as the stretch and folds you performed earlier, gather the mass of dough into a ball by stretching and folding the top, bottom, and left and right sides of the dough up and over into the center., Flip the dough over seam side down and allow to rest on the counter, covered with a tea towel, for 20 minutes., This is a good time to prepare your banneton or home-fashioned proofing basket. If using a banneton, dust with rice or all-purpose flour and set aside until ready to use. If making your own basket, take a lint-free tea towel (something without loops) and drape it in a colander. Place a rubber band around the edge to secure the towel, then dust heavily with rice or all-purpose flour., After 20 minutes, if your dough is very slack and has spread out almost flat again, flip the dough back so the seam side is up, and repeat the same action you did for the pre-shape. If it has not spread much, just move forward., Using your bench scraper, gently push the dough across and around the counter to form a tight-skinned ball, with the seam side down. Do not use much additional flour here--friction is your friend., Immediately place the boule seam side up in your banneton or proofing basket and cover with plastic—a clean shower cap works wonderfully for this job and is reusable. Place covered loaf in the refrigerator overnight or for 12-18 hours., The next morning, preheat your oven—with a lidded Dutch oven, a baking stone, or a baking sheet—to 500°F for at least one hour before putting the loaf in., Meanwhile, remove the loaf from the refrigerator and perform the poke test: lightly flour a spot on the top of the dough and press your index finger straight down into the dough. The hole should fill in slowly when the loaf is fully proofed. If the dough springs back and fills in right away, leave the dough out at room temperature while the oven preheats to allow it to warm up slightly and finish proofing. If the hole fills in slowly, return the loaf to the refrigerator and remove for baking once the oven is sufficiently preheated., Cut a piece of parchment paper slightly wider than your loaf and crumple it, then smooth it flat. Doing this helps the loaf maintain its round shape. Place the parchment on a plate or cutting board, then place it parchment-down on top of the banneton or proofing basket. Flip the dough onto the parchment-covered plate or board, then remove the basket., Working quickly and confidently, score the bread with your lame, razor, or knife. You can try a classic X pattern, one straight cut from top to bottom, or the pattern of your choosing; keep it simple if you are new to scoring. Cutting at a 45° angle to the surface of the bread helps with the development of an “ear”, or that signature raised edge you see on artisanal loaves., If using a dutch oven: remove from the preheated oven and remove lid. Quickly and carefully, use the parchment as a sling to lift and place the loaf of bread into the dutch oven. Cover, and place in the oven. Bake for 20 minutes covered at 500°F, then carefully remove the lid, lower the oven temperature to 475°F, and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes., If using a baking stone: either slide the parchment paper with the loaf from the plate or board onto the preheated stone, or lift it and place on the stone. Bake for 20 minutes at 500°F, then lower the oven temperature to 475°F, and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes., If using a baking stone: either slide the parchment paper with the loaf from the plate or board onto the preheated stone, or lift it and place on the stone. Bake for 20 minutes at 500°F, then lower the oven temperature to 475°F, and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes., If using a baking tray: use the parchment as a sling to lift and place the loaf on the preheated tray. Spritz with a bit of water prior to putting in the oven. Bake for 20 minutes at 500°F, then lower the oven temperature to 475°F, and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes., Remove the bread from the oven and, wearing oven mitts, lightly tap the bottom of the loaf. If it sounds hollow, it is done. To be sure, insert an instant-read thermometer into the bottom of the loaf. A finished loaf will read about 205°F at the center., Cool completely before cutting. Store uneaten bread in a paper bag or loosely wrapped in a tea towel. If bread goes a bit stale, toasting it is a great way to instantly improve the texture after a few days.","[('bread flour', 400.0, 'grams'), ('whole wheat flour', 100.0, 'grams'), ('water', 400.0, 'grams'), ('sourdough starter', 100.0, 'grams'), ('kosher salt', 10.0, 'grams')]"

Turn on the stand mixer and knead the dough for 7 minutes. My Kitchen Aid manual recommends speed 2 for bread dough. You might need to stop the machine after a couple of minutes and scrape down the sides if it isn't catching all of the flour as it kneads. If it feels a little dry add a few drops more water. Add it very gradually though so you don't accidentally add too much. It should feel slightly tacky but not wet. If you are working by hand, stir the ingredients together with a spatula until a rough dough is made, then turn out onto a clean surface. Don't flour the surface. Instead rub some olive oil on it and on your hands. It will stop any sticking and means there is no chance of you adding too much extra flour which will affect the texture of your bread, making it dry and heavy. Knead for 10 to 15 minutes, until the dough is smooth, elastic. When you squeeze the ball of dough between both of your hands, it should bounce back. If you are unsure how to knead I recommend watching this video to help you perfect your technique., Once kneaded, grease a large bowl with a little oil, then put the kneaded dough in it and move it around to coat all over in a light coat of oil., Cover with a damp, clean dish towel ( I run mine under the tap for a minute then wring it out), and leave on the kitchen counter until doubled in size. The time this takes will vary depending on how warm your kitchen is, but bear in mind that the longer it takes to rise, the more flavor there will be in your finished loaf, so unless you are in a hurry, don’t rush it by cranking up the heat or putting it somewhere very warm. Mine generally takes between 60 - 90 minutes to double in a 20°C kitchen., Once the dough has doubled, scrape it gently onto a clean, lightly oiled work surface.Try not to tear it. Use the heels of your hands to flatten it into a rectangle roughly the width of your bread pan., Fold the bottom third up and use the heel of your hand to push it down and seal it a bit. Then fold the top third down and push it down to seal it again. Then fold the dough in half again and pinch closed. Watch my video to see these steps. Gently turn under the ends if they look a little untidy then gently place in a lightly oiled bread pan. It will fit well into an 8.5 by 4.5 inch pan or a 9 x 5 inch pan., Rub a tiny bit of oil over the surface of the dough to stop sticking, then cover again with the damp dish towel and leave again until the bread dough is nicely domed and about 1 inch above the sides of the pan. It won't take as long this time. In my kitchen about 30 minutes., While you are waiting for your loaf to rise preheat your oven to 400° F (200°C)., Once risen score the top of the loaf with a lame or very sharp knife. A serrated knife works well. If you've got kitchen scissors you can even cut it with those (you can do one long cut all the way down the middle, or several along the width). You can bake it without scoring but accept that the bread will then decide itself where the weak point is and it might split and look a bit unsymetrical and ugly., Place in the preheated oven and bake for 40 minutes. Slide out of the pan and cool on a cooling rack. You can check it's ready by tapping the loaf on the bottom with your fist as if you are knocking on a door. It should sound hollow., As hard as it is to resist eating it when fresh out of the oven it really is best to leave it to cool completely before cutting. Cutting while still warm affects the crumb and it will stale more quickly because the cut lets the steam out. You can solve this problem by doubling the recipe and making two loaves. One for eating while warm and one for later!","[('white flour', 300.0, 'grams'), ('wholewheat flour', 200.0, 'grams'), ('instant yeast', 10.0, 'grams'), ('sea salt', 2.0, 'teaspoons'), ('olive oil', 3.0, 'tablespoons'), ('water', 310.0, 'milliliters')]"

Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise at room temperature for 1½-2 hours, until the dough has doubled in size., Remove the dough and press it with your hands to form a rectangle about 5 inches wide and 6 to 8 inches long. Working from the short side, roll up the length of the dough one section at a time, pinching the crease after each turn., The loaf will spread as you roll it, and the final length should be 8 or 9 inches, depending on the size loaf pan you have. Pinch the final seam closed, then roll the loaf back and forth to even it out, taking care not to taper the edges., Place the loaf in a lightly oiled pan making sure that the ends of the loaf touch the ends of the pan. Mist the top of the loaf with spray oil and loosely cover with plastic wrap. Allow to rise for 90 minutes, or until the dough crests above the lip of the pan. Heat the oven to 350º and place a rack in the center. Place the bread pan on a baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Rotate the pan 180º and continue baking an additional 15-30 minutes, until golden brown on the top and sides. The finished loaf should be 190ºF in the center, and the bottom should sound hollow when thumped., Remove the bread immediately from the pan and allow to cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour, preferably 2, before slicing or serving. To store, wrap the cooled loaf in plastic wrap or store in a plastic bag in a cool, dark place. Do not refrigerate it because doing so will cause the bread to dry out. If it cannot be eaten within 3 days, I recommend slicing then freezing it, which allows you to remove only as much as you need.","[('bread flour', 2.5, 'cups'), ('whole-wheat flour', 1.5, 'cups'), ('granulated sugar', 1.5, 'tablespoons'), ('salt', 1.5, 'teaspoons'), ('powdered milk', 3, 'tablespoons'), ('instant yeast', 1.5, 'teaspoons'), ('unsalted butter', 2, 'tablespoons'), ('water', 1.25, 'cups')]"

r fitted with the dough hook until the mixture is uniform. If you're hand mixing and it becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with the spoon, you can reach into your mixing vessel with very wet hands and press the mixture together. Don't knead, it isn't necessary. You're finished when everything is uniformly moist, without dry patches. It takes a few minutes, and will yield a dough that is wet and loose enough to conform to the shape of its container., Allow to rise. Cover with lid (not airtight or it could explode the lid off). Allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse (or at least flattens on the top), approx 2 hours, depending on room temperature, and initial water temperature Longer rising times, up to 5 hours, won't harm the result., You can use a portion of the dough any time after this period. Fully refrigerated dough is less sticky and easier to work with than dough at room temperature., On Baking Day:., prepare your loaf tin, tray, or whatever you're baking it in/on. Sprinkle the surface of your refrigerated dough with four. Pull up and cut of a grapefruit-size piece of dough (c 1 lb), using a serrated knife., Hold the mass of dough in your hands and add a little more flour as needed so it won't stick to your hands. Gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all 4 sides, rotating the ball a quarter-turn as you go. Most of the dusting flour will fall off - that's fine, it isn't meant to be incorporated. The bottom of the loaf may appear to be a collection of bunched ends, but it will sort itself out during resting and baking., The correctly shaped final product will be smooth and cohesive. The entire process should take no more than 30 - 60 seconds., Rest the loaf and let it rise in the form, on the tray/pizza peel, for about 40 minutes Depending on the age of the dough, you may not see much rise during this period. That's fine, more rising will occur during baking., Twenty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 450°F Place an empty broiler tray for holding water on any other shelf that won't interfere with the rising bread., Dust and Slash. Dust the top of the loaf liberally with flour, which will allow the slashing knife to pass without sticking. Slash a quarter inch deep cross, diagonal lines, or tic-tac-toe pattern on top using a serrated knife., After a 20 min preheat you're ready to bake, even though the oven thermometer won't be at full temperature yet. Put your loaf in the oven. Pour about 1 cup of hot water (from the tap) into the broiler tray and close the oven to trap the steam., Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned and firm to the touch., Store the rest of the dough in the fridge in your lidded (not airtight) container and use it over the next 14 days. The flavour and texture improves, becoming like sourdough. Even 24 hours of storage improves the flavour., This is the standard bread.

Let rise until double in size, about 10-12 hrs when the temperature is 68 F (20 C); 8 to 10 hours @ 70°F (21°C). Note: in the summer, rise the dough during the day. Once the dough is almost double in size, cover and chill the whole bowl overnight (it will continue to rise slightly in the fridge). Proceed using the cold dough the following day., Shape, Line a sheet pan with a nonstick silicone mat or parchment paper. If using parchment, lightly coat with cooking spray or oil to prevent sticking., Remove the dough onto a non- floured work surface.

Move your finger around in a circular motion to gently stretch the dough until the hole is about the size of a walnut. You can also lift up the dough, insert both index fingers through the center hole, and barrel roll to gently stretch the opening. When finished, place the dough back onto the sheet pan. It’s okay if the hole shrinks slightly. Repeat shaping the remaining dough., Second Rise, Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. The dough will puff up only slightly at this stage., Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the honey and whisk well to dissolve. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Add the seeds to a rimmed tray or shallow bowl., Boil the bagels, Add 2 to 3 bagels into the pot and simmer for 30 seconds on each side for a thin crust. Note: if using cold dough from the fridge, the bagels might not float to the surface right away. Give them a nudge after 30 seconds or so and be patient.

Add more bread flour if your dough is very wet. Scrape the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (a stiff, plastic scraper is perfect for this), invert the empty bowl over the dough, and let it rest for 20 minutes. (This is called autolyse and allows the flour to absorb some of the water and the gluten strands to begin straightening out; it makes for less kneading in the end, and will prevent you from adding too much flour right off the bat.), After 20 minutes, remove the bowl and knead the dough vigorously for about 10 minutes, adding as little flour as possible to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands and the surface, until it feels smooth, springy and elastic., Place the dough in a large, lightly oiled ceramic bowl or a large plastic container at least twice the size of the dough. You can mark the outside of the vessel with a piece of masking tape where the dough will be when it doubles, if you like. Cover the vessel tightly with plastic wrap or the lid, and allow it to rise until doubled, three to four hours. The warmer the spot you choose, the faster it will rise, the ideal temperature being 75-85º. You can also let the dough rise in the fridge or a cool place overnight. Let the dough come to room temperature before shaping it, and be sure that it has doubled in bulk to properly develop the glutens., Gently turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, pressing out the air bubbles. Shape into a boule by tucking the edges under itself, then gently rotating the dough on the surface to form a taught outer layer of dough. Here's a quick video of how to shape a boule., If you have a rising basket, sift a light layer of flour onto the inside, and place the boule in it upside-down, pinching the seam shut. (If you don't have a rising basket, place the boule directly on a peel or board dusted with cornmeal or flour.) Place the whole deal in a large plastic bag, such as a trash can liner. Inflate the bag and close it with a twist tie or clip. Let the bread rise a second time until doubled, about 1 1/2 - 2 hours., When the bread is ready to bake, it will hold an indentation of your finger when you press it lightly, rather than springing back. While the bread is rising, about an hour before you're ready to bake, remove all but the bottom rack of your oven. Place a baking stone on the rack (or a heavy duty baking sheet), and place a metal pan that you don't care about sacrificing (it will get rusty) on the floor of the oven. Crank the oven up to 500º., When the bread has doubled, gently turn it out onto a wooden peel dusted with flour or cornmeal. Holding a lame or sharp knife at a 45º angle to the loaf, draw the blade, about 1"" deep, across the top of the loaf, beginning and ending 2"" from the bottoms of the boule. (Just look at the darn picture, ok?) Fill a 1 cup measure with ice cubes. Quickly slip the boule off the peel and onto the stone, and toss the cubes into the hot pan on the floor of the oven. This will steam the outside of the loaf, allowing it to expand as it bakes., Bake 20 minutes, then turn the oven down to 450º and bake another 20 minutes or so, until the bread is a deep, burnished golden-brown. An instant read thermometer inserted into the middle should read 210º, the temperature at which the dough is set., Let cool completely on a wire rack, one to two hours, before enjoying. At this point, the bread is still ""baking"" from the residual heat and steam inside the loaf. The best way to store this type of bread is in a paper bag at room temperature for a couple days. After that, I put the whole thing, paper bag and all, into a plastic bag and continue to store at room temp.

If mixed in your Kitchen Aid, transfer dough to a medium mixing bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. (Do not spray with non-stick spray, it is not necessary).

I enjoy the flavor even after 4 hours, it's so delicious!When the dough is risen, generously flour your counter top. Scrape the loose, wet dough onto a floured surface and sprinkle top with more flour. Quickly pull edges around and to the bottom of the loaf, forming a sort of ball as you tuck the edges under itself. Use extra flour to help with ""stickiness"". This process should only take about 10-15 seconds, you do not want to overwork the dough (we want to keep some air bubbles in the structure!).

Score the top of the loaf with a serrated knife or bread lame if you'd like. This bread will not keep a design but I like to score so I can control where the bread stretches as it rises in the oven. In my opinion, the best way to bake this bread is in a dutch oven pot. I cook it with the lid on for 30 minutes, then lid off for 15 more or until golden brown. If you don't have a dutch oven pot, you can use a pizza stone. Allow the stone to preheat with the oven. Then set bread (while on parchment sheet) on the stone. You will need to tent the bread with a sheet of tin foil to avoid it getting too brown. Bake for 30 minutes and remove the tin foil for an additional 15 minutes until golden. Remove bread from the oven and set on a cooling rack. I like to cover the loaf with a lightweight flour sack towel while it cools. This helps create the most delicious and beautiful crackly texture on the crust. The bread will soften as it cools. We love to enjoy our bread warm with honey and butter.

Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and let it sit on the counter in a warm spot for 2 hours. If you plan to bake a loaf immediately, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, place the bowl of dough in the refrigerator to be used over the next 14 days. (Once refrigerated, the dough will shrink back a bit; that's okay.

It may also spread/flatten a bit; that's okay., Preheat the oven to 450°F. Set one rack in the lowest position of the oven and one rack in the middle position. Place a metal pan (any metal cake pan or broiler pan will work; just don't use glass) on the bottom rack.

Using a sharp knife, make a few ½-inch-deep slashes in the dough -- a scallop, cross, or tic tac toe pattern all look nice., Slide the baking sheet with the dough into the oven, and carefully fill the metal cake pan with one cup of hot tap water. (Try to do this quickly so as not to let heat out of the oven.) Bake until the loaf is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack., This bread is best enjoyed fresh on the day it is made. Once sliced, place the loaf cut-side down on a cutting board or plate and leave it uncovered. (If it lasts beyond a day, I suggest slicing and freezing.), Freezer-Friendly Instructions The dough can be portioned into thirds and frozen in airtight plastic containers for up to 1 month. Defrost the dough in the refrigerator overnight, then shape, rest and bake as usual. The baked loaves can also be frozen whole or sliced: Wrap in a zip-top freezer bag and freeze for up to 1 month. (If you plan to use slices one at a time, place pieces of parchment between them so they don't stick.) To thaw, take the bread out of the freezer and let it come to room temperature on the countertop. Reheat in a 350°F oven until warmed through, about 10 minutes., Note: Active dry yeast may be used instead of instant/rapid-rise yeast, however, the dough will take longer to rise. To give active dry yeast a boost, you can dissolve it in the lukewarm water and let it sit until frothy, about 10 minutes. After that, add it to the flour and salt, and proceed with the recipe., Note: I use King Arthur flour, which is higher in protein than some other all-purpose flours. If using a flour with a lower protein content, such as Gold Medal, you will likely need to add a few more tablespoons of flour.","[('flour', 6.5, 'cups'), ('salt', 4.0, 'teaspoons'), ('yeast', 1.5, 'tablespoons'), ('water', 3.0, 'cups')]"

Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature (68 F) for 30 minutes., After the dough has rested, work the dough into a ball. To do this, grab a portion of the dough and fold it over, pressing your fingertips into the center. Repeat, working your way around the dough until it begins to tighten., TIP, If the dough feels too wet (and this can happen depending on the brand of flour you’re using), add 1 tbsp. of flour. Mix thoroughly by hand, adding more flour as needed. If you think it’s too dry, add 1 tbsp. of water and see how you go., Bulk Rise, Cover the bowl (damp towel or plastic wrap) and let rise overnight at room temperature. This will take about 10 to 12 hours at 68 F. The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense and has doubled in size. If using a standard 8-inch bowl, the dough will rise about 1/2 way up the sides., Optional Step, about 1 hour into the bulk rise, do 1 set of stretch and folds. Repeat 1 hour later. This will increase the overall volume of the bread., Shape the Dough, The following morning, line a small bowl with a cotton or linen cloth. Sprinkle with flour., Important, You’re going to shape the dough twice to build extra strength., Preshape, Remove the dough onto a floured surface. To shape the dough into a round, starting at the top, gently fold the dough over toward the center. Give it a turn and fold over the next section. Repeat until you have come full circle. Using a bench knife, scoop up the dough and flip it over (the smooth side should be facing up). Cover and rest for 20-30 minutes., Final Shape, After the dough has rested, flip it over again (the smooth side should be facing down now). Shape it again following the steps above. Flip it back over. With floured hands, gently cup the dough and pull it toward you in a circular motion to tighten its shape., Place the dough into the lined bowl, seam side up.

It should start to pull away from the bowl. The dough will look wet and sticky., Place the dough in a large bowl that has been lightly oiled. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place the bowl in a warm part of your kitchen away from any drafts., Allow the dough to rise for at least 12 hours up to a maximum of 16 hours. 12-14 hours is the sweet spot. Bubbles wil form in the dough and it may drop a bit after rising., Proof and Bake, Lightly flour the countertop and dump out the bread dough on the floured surface., Add flour into the dough as you work the dough around. This will take about 5 minutes. Keep adding flour until the dough isn't sticky. Form the dough into a ball., On a floured surface, flatten the dough out to make a rectangle., Fold over 1/3 of the dough to the center (you're folding the widest part first as shown in the pictures). Fold over the other side of the rectangle overlapping the first fold of the dough., Continue the folding process by folding the bottom 1/3 of the dough upwards towards the center of the little package you've made., Fold the top part of the dough down overlapping the fold you just made., Turn the dough over (seam side down) and make a disc or oblong loaf depending upon what shape bread you want to make., Place the finished dough on parchment paper (sprinkle cornmeal or flour on the parchment before placing the dough), Cover the dough with a bowl or damp tea towel for the second rise., Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and place the empty cloche or dutch oven in the oven on the middle rack to preheat along with the oven., Place the covered dough on top of the stove to finish rising for 30 - 40 minutes., When the dough has fully risen, using a very sharp knife cut a design into the top of the bread.

It should be tacky, but not cling to your finger.), Transfer to a medium-sized bowl, lightly coated with oil. Cover with plastic and let rise for 3 hours, turning and folding the dough once or twice., Remove dough, turn and fold again, and place it back in the bowl, seam-side up. Let rise for another 2 hours. TIP: I do this right over the bowl with my hands oiled from the dough, which is usually enough - add more oil to your hands if needed., After the second rise, place a square of parchment on a cookie sheet, sprinkle the dough with flour and gently shape the dough into a ball or oval (using lots of flour, as the dough is moist) and set on the parchment. Shape it in your hands right over the parchment. I often flour my fingers after setting on the parchment and use my fingers to push the edges under the loaf to get the shape I want and make it more compact. Make sure there's a good coating of flour on the top, as this will make slicing the top later easier. TIP: I often shape the dough in a small skillet to keep the edges from spreading as much as a cookie sheet., To Bake with a Dutch Oven: While the shaped dough is resting, set an empty enameled cast iron dutch oven into a cold oven and turn heat to 450 degrees (alternately, you can use a baking stone), and set the timer for 40 minutes., When the timer goes off, slash the top of the loaf with a serrated knife (in 2-3 places) and transfer it to the hot pot (or stone) by holding the edges of the parchment to gently lower into the pot (the bread will bake while on the parchment)., Replace the hot lid and bake for 12-15 minutes. Remove the lid and continue baking for another 13-15 minutes, until golden brown., To Bake without a Dutch Oven: After shaping the loaf on the parchment on the counter (or skillet), place either a baking stone, cast iron skillet, or cookie sheet into a cold oven and preheat to 450 degrees.Creating Steam: To try and get the crust we all love, you'll need to create some steam (that's what the dutch oven does - it traps the steam): put a pan with water on the bottom rack to heat while the stone heats OR spray the dough with water right before putting in the hot oven to bake and see which you like best. Also, if you have any deep lid that will fit over the dough and allow to rise, you can add that OR try tenting aluminum foil over the top.Baking: Slash and use parchment corners to transfer dough to your hot stone and bake 15 minutes, turning the dough halfway, and then bake until done, another 15 to 20-25 minutes., Remove to a wire rack to cool at least 30 minutes before cutting.","[('flour', 3.0, 'cups'), ('water', 1.25, 'cups'), ('sourdough starter', 0.75, 'cups'), ('honey', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('salt', 1.5, 'teaspoons')]"

Then go straight to the rise., Otherwise, mix with your fingers until no dry bits remain. Leave the dough to rest covered for 60 minutes., At this point, you can choose to jump straight to the rise, making it a no-knead bread. Otherwise, you can do three sets of stretch and folds or coil folds spaced out by 30 minutes.

Let the dough rise by 25%., DON'T USE TIME!! Time varies on many factors, so go by the rise, not time., If you are bulking cold, below 21°C/70°F, let the dough rise 100%.If you are bulking at room temperature, around 21°C-25°C/70°F, let the dough rise 50%.If you are bulking warm, above 25°C/77°F, let the dough rise 25%., Divide and pre-shape, If you are making one loaf and used coil folds, skip straight to final shaping., Divide the dough into two equally sized pieces by cutting it with your bench scraper.

Put your fingers in to be sure there are no big lumps., Fold. I use a diaper-style. First a piece up, then the two side flaps over., Flip over so that the smooth side faces up and the folds are at the bottom., Gently pat to make a round ball. It doesn't have to be perfect., Place the ball in the center of the lined dutch oven., Cover the dutch oven and set a timer for 30 minutes. This allows the dough to rest and rise before baking., Set aside to allow it to rise at room temperature. I tend to place it in a cold oven. This will be risen and ready to use use in one hour. However, you can make it ahead up to 18 hours in advance! You will not want to keep the dough out to rise for more than 18 hours. If you have not baked or cooked your dough within a day, it should be refrigerated or frozen to bake at another time., Dutch Oven Baking Method, During the 30 minute rest period, preheat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit or 218 degrees Celsius. The rack should be toward the bottom for a conventional oven. I use the second level from the bottom., If you choose to score your bread with a sharp blade, you would do this once the dough is done resting and when it is ready to go into the oven. Bake for 30 minutes with the lid on and closed., Take the bread out of the dutch oven for the second part of the baking process., The next set of instructions are key to creating a perfectly browned bread for the second half of bread-baking, that is not burned or over-baked on one side., Take the dutch oven lid and invert it so that it is closing an empty pot. Place cornmeal in the center to cover the area and size of the bread., Place a baking mat or parchment paper over the cornmeal., Place the bread on top of the prepared baking mat. Place back into the oven to bake for 30 minutes., For a golden and softer crust, remove from the oven at 30 minutes and allow to cool before cutting., For a darker and crisper crust, allow to cook for 10-15 minutes longer, until your desired color is achieved., Slice and enjoy. Fresh-baked bread is best when enjoyed the same day it is baked., Storage, If you prefer a soft crust, and want the bread to last longer before going stale, you can store in an airtight container or plastic at room temperature for up to five days., If you do not want to compromise the crispness (or chosen hardness) of the crust, you will store in a wrapped cloth. The old-school Italian method is cloth., Fold the cloth down, then over, and tuck under the bread., Bread can be stored this way for up to three days.

Warm the water if the ingredients are too cold and cool the water if ingredients are too warm. Add the 900 grams bread flour and 100 grams whole wheat flour to the bowl and mix until incorporated and a shaggy dough forms. Let rest for 30 minutes., Mixing: After 30 minutes, add the reserved salt and 50 grams of water. Combine using your hands by squeezing the dough between your fingers, pinching chunks of dough and reincorporating together. The dough will break apart and then reform in the bowl through this process. Pick up one side of the dough and fold it over on itself. The dough will be sticky. Wet your hands as needed and continue to work with the dough until all the salt and water has been incorporated. This can take about 3-5 minutes until the dough is cohesive and strong. Transfer the dough to a plastic container or a glass bowl if desired., Bulk Fermentation: Perform 3-4 sets of ""stretch and folds."", To “stretch and fold,” wet your hand (so it doesn’t stick to the dough). Reach down to the bottom of the bowl of dough and pull the dough up and over the top of the dough. Turn the bowl 1/4 turn and repeat the stretch and fold. Turn another quarter turn and repeat. Perform one more 1/4 turn with stretching and folding the dough. Cover and set aside., Repeat the stretch and folds every 30 minutes for the first two hours., Let the dough rest in a warm place, for the rest of bulk fermentation, about 1 1/2 - 2 hours at 78 degrees. During this time the dough will puff up about 30-40%, become more aerated, start to pull away from the edges of the bowl and have a few scattered bubbles around the edges/top of the dough. If you dough is not showing these signs, make sure it's warm enough and give it another half an hour or so until it is showing those signs that it's ready to shape., Divide: Tip the bowl upside down, allowing the dough to fall onto a clean counter surface. Be gentle to avoid cutting and degassing the dough as much as possible. Use a bench knife to cut the dough into two equal portions., Pre-Shape: Wet your hands and the bench knife. Push the bench knife under the dough while using your free hand to tuck the dough under itself. Repeat this process going around in a circle until you have a tight ball of dough. Repeat with the second loaf., Bench Rest: Let the dough rest uncovered for about 30 minutes at room temperature. The dough will flatten a bit during this period of time., Prepare the bowls: Prepare two bannetons or small bowls. Place a kitchen towel or hair net in a bowl. Liberally flour each bowl., Shaping: After the dough has rested for about 30 minutes it is time to shape the bread into a round. Sprinkle flour on top of the dough. Using the bench knife, lift the dough up off the counter and place it on top of the countertop–floured side down. This ensures that the flour is staying mainly on the outside of the dough. Going around in a circle, pull the dough sideways towards you and then fold up to the top of the round. Move 90 degrees and repeat the same process pulling the dough sideways and then folding up to the top. As you continue this process around the dough, increase the tension as you pull. Gather the bread into a circle and use a bench knife to lift the bread and place into your lined bowl., Cold Fermentation: Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a reusable cover and store in the refrigerator overnight or for up to 12-24 hours. Alternatively you can let your dough rise outside the fridge for another 3-4 hours, keeping the dough at that 78 degree F temperature, and then bake your loaves the same day., Day 3: Bake, Pre-heat the Oven: Put a dutch oven (top and all) into the oven and preheat to 500 degrees. Allow the dutch oven to heat for about 30 minutes to an hour at 500 degrees., Once preheated for 30 minutes, pull your first loaf out of the refrigerator. Remove the plastic wrap (this is easy to do straight out of the refrigerator if the dough is chilled–not easy if the dough warms up) and place a piece of parchment paper on top of the bread dough. Flip the dough over so that the dough is now sitting on the parchment paper. Take off the bowl/banneton and kitchen towel., Scoring: Smooth the flour over the top of the dough (add a little extra for more contrast if desired). Use a very sharp knife or bread lame to score the dough., Bake: Carefully remove the dutch oven from the 500 degree oven with hot pads. Take the top off and place your bread into the dutch oven (including parchment paper–this helps with the transfer). Be very careful not to touch the sides of the dutch oven. Put your hot pads back on before you pick up the lid of the dutch oven and place it on top of the bread. Put the whole dutch oven back into your oven. Lower the temperature to 450 degrees and bake for 25 minutes. Once 25 minutes are up, take the top off the dutch oven and continue baking for 20 minutes until the bread is a crackly deep brown. The loaf should register between 205-210℉ when it's finished baking., Remove the baked loaf from the dutch oven and pre-heat the dutch oven again for 15-20 minutes. Score the second loaf and bake according to the same directions.

If you like very thick french toast (you should try it at least once!), find a local bakery and get yourself a loaf of challah or brioche bread (buy a day-old loaf if they have it.) I don't like using French bread or the regular loaves you find in the deli at the grocery store; the crusts turn out too chewy. You want a nice soft edge. If you can't get to a bakery, head to the grocery store and buy the thickest and softest white bread you can find. (3/4 inch or thicker.) Texas toast is great. I like to use the Artesano brand of bread; they sell a pre-sliced brioche loaf that is pretty legit. But their white bread is also nice and soft. See photos., Slice your bread with a serrated knife if you are working with a whole loaf. See photos. I like my slices to be about 1 and 1/4 inch thick, which feels a little ridiculous, but trust me. You can even go up to 2 inches if you're feeling wild. Don't slice thinner than 3/4 inch., Set your bread aside, spread out so that it gets a little dried out. Day old bread is great for French toast. In France, they call this dish ""Lost Bread"" because it's what you make when you have dried out bread to use up. (I experimented with toasting the bread first, but thought it dried out the finished product too much.), Make the egg mixture. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl,* whisk together 3 egg yolks, 1 and 1/2 cups heavy cream* or half & half, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg, if you like. Whisk until it is completely smooth and the cinnamon is well incorporated., Pour the mixture into a shallow dish like a pie plate, or an 8x8 inch pan. Place a slice of bread in the mixture and let it sit there for 10 to 20 seconds. How long you soak it depends on how thick your bread is. It should be soft when you touch it, but still hold itself together. Flip the bread and soak the other side. You can start cooking the French toast right away, or you can place the soaked bread on a baking sheet or plate while you finish soaking all of them., Cook the French toast: Heat an electric griddle or large 12 inch skillet over medium low heat. When it is hot, add 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (or any oil with a high smoke point.) Swirl it around until the pan is coated. Place the French toast on the pan with 1 to 2 inches in between each slice of bread. Cook on medium low heat for 3-5 minutes. The timing depends on your oven or griddle, so stick around and keep an eye on it., Caramelize. When the bottom of the first side is LIGHT brown (we are going to cook this side twice), sprinkle about a half tablespoon granulated sugar on the top (raw) side of the bread. Flip the toast, sugar side down, and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Be sure to swirl the pan so oil re-coats it, or add more butter/oil if necessary). Then, sprinkle another half tablespoon of sugar on the cooked side, and flip it over again so that it lightly caramelizes the first side., Keep your toast warm. Preheat your oven to the ""keep warm"" setting, about 170 degrees F. As you finish frying the toast, transfer each one to a wire cooling rack set over a baking sheet. Keep toast warm in the oven until ready to serve., I honestly don't even put maple syrup on caramelized French toast. I feel like it doesn't really need it, plus it makes the caramel edge not as crunchy. I like to eat it plain, or with a little jam. But maple syrup is really delicious if you are in the mood! A sprinkle of powdered sugar and a berry garnish never hurt either., Keep leftovers stored covered in the fridge. It will keep for 3-5 days. You can reheat leftovers in the microwave or the toaster. Or heat your oven to 350 and heat the toast all together on a wire rack set over a baking sheet, until the toast is warmed, about 5-10 minutes.","[('challah', 1.0, 'loaf'), ('brioche', 1.0, 'loaf'), ('bread', 8.0, 'slice'), ('egg yolks', 3.0, None), ('heavy cream', 1.5, 'cup'), ('sugar', 0.25, 'cup'), ('vanilla', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('salt', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('cinnamon', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('nutmeg', 1.0, 'pinch'), ('granted sugar', None), ('butter', None), ('vegetable oil', None), ('maple syrup', None), ('powdered sugar', None), ('strawberries', None), ('blueberries', None), ('raspberries', None)]"

Stir it all together just enough to get the flour mixed in, but don't knead, and don't worry about little lumps and inconsistencies., The dough should look shaggy and somewhat dry after this step. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. This initial 30-minute rest period allows the flour to absorb the water before adding the salt., After the 30 minutes is up, add 1T salt to the dough, get your hands wet (water helps handle sticky dough), and use your hands to work the salt into the dough for a minute or so. Then cover the dough with a towel., Now that you've added and mixed in the salt and let the dough rest for 30 minutes, it's time for the first stretch and fold. Uncover the dough, grab one side of it with both hands and stretch it up at least a foot from the bowl, then fold it toward the opposite side of the dough. Repeat this 4 times on each ""side"" of the bowl., Cover the bowl with a towel, and let it rest for 30 minutes., After 30 minutes, uncover the dough and repeat the stretch and fold process just like the first time. Cover and let the dough rest for another 30 minutes. Repeat this stretch and fold process followed by a 30-minute rest 3 times, for a total of 3 stretch and folds., After the third stretch and fold, cover the dough and let it rest until it is doubled in size. Depending on the strength of your starter, the hydration of the dough, and the temperature + elevation of your home, this could take anywhere from 2 to 12 hours. That's a wide range! See why it's better to watch the dough rather than the clock?, The dough should be a lot stretchier and smoother throughout the fermentation process with each stretch and fold than when you first mixed it!, Once the dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface and stretch it into a big rectangle, kind of like if you were going to make cinnamon rolls., If the dough is really sticky, just dust it with a bit of flour or get your hands wet to make it easier to handle., Fold one of the long sides of the dough over to bring the edge to the middle of the rectangle, then fold the other long side over the top of the first side. Now that the dough is folded into 3 layers it looks like a very long, skinny rectangle. Start at the end closest to you and roll the dough up into a ball., Then roll it toward you in a circular motion so the seam side is facing down. Use both hands to spin the dough on the work surface a few times to tighten the seal underneath and create surface tension (a tightly sealed ball of dough)., Turn the shaped ball of dough over into a banneton basket so the seam side is now facing up, cover the basket with plastic wrap or place it in a big plastic bag, and place it in the fridge to cold-proof before baking., During this cold-proofing step, the cold temperature with prevent the natural yeast from causing the dough to rise anymore, but the fermentation process will continue to an extent, breaking down the gluten further. The dough will also firm up while in the fridge which makes it easier to score before baking., If your starter is very strong and active, this step can be as short as 2 hours - just long enough for the dough to chill before scoring and baking so it doesn't lose its shape and gives a nice oven spring., I like to let my dough cold-proof for at least 12 hours to continue developing that sourdough flavor, so letting it cold-proof overnight before morning baking is perfect., When you're ready to bake, start by preheating a dutch oven, bread oven, or crock with a lid in the oven at 425F for 30 minutes., Leave the hot dutch oven (DO) in the preheated oven while you score the dough to prepare it for baking. You want the DO as hot as possible when the dough goes in., Remove the dough from the fridge, and turn it out onto a piece of parchment paper. Lightly dust the tip of the dough with flour (optional) and then use a razor blade to score the dough. You can get very artistic with scoring. But for starters, just stick with 1 to 3 big expansion scores., Expansion scores allow the loaf to expand while baking and give the loaf a nice shape, hence the name., If scoring along the side of the dough, hold the razor at a 45-degree angle., Place the dough on the parchment paper in the hot dutch oven and cover it with the lid. Bake at 425F with the lid on for 30 minutes., After 30 minutes, remove the lid and bake for another 8-10 minutes until the top of the loaf is golden brown. Place the loaf on a wire rack to cool for an hour at the very least before slicing., Professional sourdough bakers recommend allowing the loaf to rest for 12-24 hours before slicing. This is because the dough is still very hot and lots of moisture is trapped inside when it first comes out of the oven. If you cut into the loaf before it is cooled, it will lose moisture and be gummy, dry, and tough. It's worth the wait!","[('water', 1.5, 'cups'), ('starter', 1.0, 'cup'), ('flour', 3.0, 'cups'), ('salt', 1.0, 'tablespoon')]"

That should put it at about 100°F (40°C)., Mix, In the large bowl of a standing mixer or a 6-quart container with a lid, mix the yeast, warm water, and salt. Don’t worry about getting the yeast to dissolve., Add the flour to the yeast mixture all at once, then use a spoon or stand mixer to mix until the flour is completely incorporated and you have a blobby dough. (If you’re hand-mixing the dough and it becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with the spoon, just use very wet hands to press the mixture together.) Don’t knead the dough! It's not necessary. You just want the dough to be uniformly wet and loose enough to conform to the shape of its container. All you need to do is be certain that there are no dry patches of flour., Rest, Loosely cover the container and let the dough hang out at room temperature until it begins to rise and collapse or at least flatten a little on the top, about 2 hours. (Relax. It's bread dough, not a newborn. You don’t need to monitor it constantly. And don't worry about the dough being precisely double or triple its original volume as you would with a traditional bread recipe. Just walk away, go about your business, and come back in 2 hours. Seriously.), Stash the dough in the fridge, Chill, After 2 hours, stash the container of dough in the fridge. That's it. (If your container isn’t vented, you want to ensure the gases can escape by leaving the cover open a crack for the first couple days in the fridge; after that, you can seal it.), Prepare, You can use the dough anytime after the initial 2-hour rise, although the refrigerated wet dough is less sticky and easier to work with than dough at room temperature, so it’s best to refrigerate the dough overnight before handling it. Once refrigerated, the dough will seem to have shrunk back upon itself as though it will never rise again—that’s normal. Whatever you do, do not punch down this dough. You’re trying to retain as much gas in the dough as possible, and punching it down knocks gas out and results in denser loaves. Just be certain to use the dough at some point within 14 days., Shape the dough into a loaf, Dust, When you want to bake a loaf of artisan bread, dust a pizza peel or a baking sheet turned upside down with cornmeal or line it with parchment paper., Flour, Grab a hunk of the dough and use a serrated knife or scissors to cut off about a 1-pound piece of dough. Hold the dough in your hands and, if necessary, add just enough flour so the dough doesn't stick to your hands. (What you're trying to do is surround the surface of the dough with flour so that it can be handled. You're not trying to incorporate more flour into the dough, so for the love of all things good, resist the temptation to get rid of all the dough's inherent and lovely stickiness by working the flour into the dough.), Shape, Gently stretch the surface of the dough, tucking the ends underneath the ball and rotating it a quarter turn as you go. (See video above.) Most of the dusting flour will fall off, and that's okay, because as we just said, it's not intended to be incorporated into the dough. The bottom of the ball of dough may appear to be a collection of bunched ends, but it will flatten out and adhere during resting and baking. The rest of your round loaf should be smooth and cohesive, and the entire shaping process should take no more than 20 to 40 seconds—don't work the dough any longer or your loaves may be dense., Rest, Place the ball of dough on the prepared pizza peel or baking sheet, seam side down with all the collected bunched ends on the peel or board. Let it rest for about 40 minutes. It doesn’t need to be covered. (You may not see much rise during this period, but don't fret. It will rise much more during baking.), Bake that gorgeous-looking loaf, Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C) for at least 20 to 30 minutes. Preheat a baking stone (or an upside-down cast-iron skillet or baking sheet) on a middle rack for at least 20 to 30 minutes. Place an empty metal broiler tray on any rack that won’t interfere with the rising bread. (Do not use a glass pan as it could shatter.), Dust the top of the raised loaf generously with flour and, using a serrated bread knife, slash a 1/2-inch-deep cross or a couple gashes or a tic-tac-toe pattern in the top. There's no need to dust the flour off the loaf., Slide, Place the far edge of the peel or the upside-down baking sheet in the oven on the baking stone or cast-iron skillet or upside-down baking sheet a few inches beyond where you want the bread to land. Give the peel or baking sheet a couple quick back-and-forth jiggles and then abruptly pull it out from under the loaf. The loaf should land on the baking stone with very little drama., Pour, Quickly but carefully pour about 1 cup hot water into the broiler tray and immediately shut the oven door to trap the steam. Bake the bread for a total of 20 to 35 minutes, until the crust is richly browned and firm to the touch. Because the dough is so wet, there's very little risk of it becoming dry despite how dark the crust may become. (If you're using a baking sheet rather than a baking stone, you may need a little extra time—up to 50 minutes total—for the bread to be done.), Cool, Remove the bread from the oven and let the loaf cool completely, preferably on a wire rack for the best flavor, texture, and slicing. (Crazily enough, a perfectly baked loaf will audibly crackle, or “sing,” when initially exposed to room temperature.) The crust may initially soften but will firm when cooled.","[('water', 3.0, 'cups'), ('yeast', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('salt', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('flour', 6.5, 'cups'), ('cornmeal', None, None)]"

(as shown in the progress pictures here). Place in a 7 x 4-inch loaf pan or similar baking tray. (I'm using a 4 x 6-inch Pyrex dish)Pro tip - The measurements given here are just guidelines. As long as the dough is about half the pan leaving enough space for the dough to double you can use any baking pan you have., Proof - Cover with plastic wrap or clean kitchen cloth and let proof for 30 to 45 minutes.Pro tip - Spray the plastic wrap with oil to prevent it from sticking to the rolls., Bake, Preheat - 20 minutes before baking, preheat the oven at 380°F /190°C / Gas Mark 5, Eggwash - Brush the bread with a beaten egg. Sprinkle some sesame seeds. Pro tip - Egg wash is a full egg with 2 tbsp of water., Bake - If you make two loaves with this dough, bake each for 20 to 25 minutes until you have a nice golden brown. If you make one large loaf, bake for about 40 to 45 minutes until you have a nice golden brown color. Pro tip - When baked, the internal temperature of the bread should be about 195 F. The bread will have a hollow sound on the bottom when tapped., Cool - Remove and let cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Then, cover it with a clean kitchen cloth to keep it soft.Pro tip - Do not leave the loaf on the tray for too long as the steam will make the bread soggy on the bottom. Covering the bread with a cloth will help the bread retain moisture and prevent it from drying out.","[('milk', 320, 'g'), ('egg', 50, 'g'), ('yeast', 7, 'g'), ('sugar', 15, 'g'), ('salt', 7, 'g'), ('flour', 500, 'cups'), ('butter', 60, 'g'), ('ham', 250, 'g'), ('cheese', 250, 'g'), ('egg', 0.5, None), ('sesame seeds', 2, 'tbsp')]"

Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment, or find a Dutch oven with a diameter that's just a tiny bit larger than your pumpkin. If you bake the pumpkin in a casserole, it will keep its shape, but it might stick to the casserole, so you'll have to serve it from the pot—which is an appealingly homey way to serve it. If you bake it on a baking sheet, you can present it freestanding, but maneuvering a heavy stuffed pumpkin with a softened shell isn't so easy. However, since I love the way the unencumbered pumpkin looks in the center of the table, I've always taken my chances with the baked-on-a-sheet method, and so far, I've been lucky., Using a very sturdy knife—and caution—cut a cap out of the top of the pumpkin (think Halloween Jack-o-Lantern). It's easiest to work your knife around the top of the pumpkin at a 45-degree angle. You want to cut off enough of the top to make it easy for you to work inside the pumpkin. Clear away the seeds and strings from the cap and from inside the pumpkin. Season the inside of the pumpkin generously with salt and pepper, and put it on the baking sheet or in the pot., Toss the bread, cheese, garlic, bacon, and herbs together in a bowl. Season with pepper—you probably have enough salt from the bacon and cheese, but taste to be sure—and pack the mix into the pumpkin. The pumpkin should be well filled—you might have a little too much filling, or you might need to add to it. Stir the cream with the nutmeg and some salt and pepper and pour it into the pumpkin. Again, you might have too much or too little—you don't want the ingredients to swim in cream, but you do want them nicely moistened. (It's hard to go wrong here.), Put the cap in place and bake the pumpkin for about 2 hours—check after 90 minutes—or until everything inside the pumpkin is bubbling and the flesh of the pumpkin is tender enough to be pierced easily with the tip of a knife. Because the pumpkin will have exuded liquid, I like to remove the cap during the last 20 minutes or so, so that the liquid can bake away and the top of the stuffing can brown a little., When the pumpkin is ready, carefully, very carefully—it's heavy, hot, and wobbly—bring it to the table or transfer it to a platter that you'll bring to the table., You have a choice—you can either spoon out portions of the filling, making sure to get a generous amount of pumpkin into the spoonful, or you can dig into the pumpkin with a big spoon, pull the pumpkin meat into the filling, and then mix everything up. I'm a fan of the pull-and-mix option. Served in hearty portions followed by a salad, the pumpkin is a perfect cold-weather main course; served in generous spoonfuls, it's just right alongside the Thanksgiving turkey., It's really best to eat this as soon as it's ready. However, if you've got leftovers, you can scoop them out of the pumpkin, mix them up, cover, and chill them; reheat them the next day., There are many ways to vary this arts-and-crafts project. Instead of bread, I've filled the pumpkin with cooked rice—when it's baked, it's almost risotto-like. And, with either bread or rice, on different occasions I've added cooked spinach, kale, chard, or peas (the peas came straight from the freezer). I've made it without bacon (a wonderful vegetarian dish), and I've also made it and loved, loved, loved it with cooked sausage meat; cubes of ham are also a good idea. Nuts are a great addition, as are chunks of apple or pear or pieces of chestnut.","[('pumpkin', 3.0, 'pounds'), ('salt', 1.0, None), ('pepper', 1.0, None), ('bread', 0.25, 'pound'), ('cheese', 0.25, 'pound'), ('garlic', 2.0, 'cloves'), ('bacon', 4.0, 'slices'), ('chives', 0.25, 'cup'), ('scallions', 0.25, 'cup'), ('thyme', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('cream', 0.33, 'cup'), ('nutmeg', 1.0, 'pinch')]"

Add the flours and salt. Combine to form a stiff dough, then finish mixing by hand to fully incorporate the flour. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes., Add the Fillings: After the dough has rested, add the olives, thyme, lemon zest and parmesan cheese (if using) to the bowl. Gently knead the fillings into the dough, using the stretch and fold technique, To do this: stretch the dough upward and fold it over toward the center of the bowl. Give the dough a turn and repeat (stretching, folding and turning) until the fillings are tucked into the dough., Bulk Rise: Cover the bowl with lightly coated plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until double in size. This will take about 8 to 10 hours at 70 F (21 C). Note: if making the dough in the summer, the rise time will be considerably less; bulk rise during the day and chill the whole bowl overnight when almost double in size. Optional Step: If you’d like, for added structure, do 1-2 sets of stretch and folds during the bulk rise, spaced 30 minutes apart., Shape: Remove the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Shape it into a round or oval and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, line a proofing basket with a towel and dust with flour. With floured hands, gently cup the dough and pull it toward you to tighten its shape. Then place the dough into your basket, seam side up., Second Rise: Cover the dough and let rest until noticeably puffy but not fully risen, about 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on temperature. Alternatively, chill the dough overnight, up to 8 hours. Let rest at room temperature while the oven heats up before baking. Preheat your oven to 450 F (230 C). Cut a sheet of parchment paper to fit the size of your baking pot., Score: Place the parchment over the dough and invert the basket to release. Sprinkle the dough very lightly with flour and rub the surface to coat. Make one long, off-center cut down the length of the loaf using a small knife or razor blade. Use the parchment to transfer the dough into the baking pot., Bake the dough on the center rack for 20 minutes, covered. Remove the lid, and continue to bake for 30 minutes. Lift the loaf out of the pot and finish baking directly on the oven rack for the last 10 minutes.

Just stir and turn the dough over until there are no traces of dry ingredients., Cover the bowl and let the dough rest in room temperature for 12 to 18 hours.

After 18 hours, the dough will have risen and may be a shade darker than it was when you started., Place a piece of parchment paper on the countertop and dust very generously with flour. Wet your hands and fold the dough over on itself a few times to release the air inside the dough. (Wetting your hands will help prevent the dough from sticking to you.) Shape the dough into a round and place it on the floured parchment paper, seam side down., Dust more flour on the top of the dough and cover the dough by inverting the mixing bowl over the top. (Alternately, you could use a clean kitchen towel to cover the dough, but I find this often sticks to the dough, ruining both the appearance of the bread and the towel.)

Next, grab the right edge of the dough and firmly stretch & fold over the center, towards the left side of the dough. Again, press firmly down with your fingertips. Grab the lefthand side of the dough and stretch & fold to the righthand side. Finally, take the portion the dough near the top of the board, and stretch towards the bottom side, closest to you. Flip the whole thing over, so the board side is now facing up. All of the seams should now be tucked under the bundle. The air that was introduced here will allow more rise, and create more tension within the bread for a sturdy loaf., shape, You're now going to repeat the rounding shaping by cupping your hands on either side of the loaf and gently turning & pulling towards you at the same time.

Lightly oil the surface of the starter. Allow the starter to start to ferment at warm room temperature (75°to 80°F) before storing it in the refrigerator. If you are planning to bake more bread soon, you want the starter to ferment longer at room temperature so it will be more active sooner. If you are not planning to bake more bread for several days, you want to slow down the fermentation by refrigerating it sooner so that the yeast doesn't consume all the added flour., If baking bread the next day or the day after feeding the starter, refrigerate the starter after 2 hours at room temperature., If baking bread 3 days after feeding the starter, refrigerate the starter after 1 hour at room temperature., If baking bread 1 week after feeding the starter, refrigerate the starter after 30 minutes at room temperature., 1. Give the starter the first feeding and allow it to ferment and rise (you will be increasing the starter by 4 times, from 25 grams to 100 grams). Tear off a scant 2 tablespoons (1 scant ounce/25 grams) of the sourdough starter (discard any remaining starter) and place it in a small bowl., Add 1/3 cup (1.75 ounces/50 grams) of the flour and 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons (1 scant ounce/25 grams) of the water. With a wooden spoon and then your hand, mix and knead together until all the flour is absorbed. If after about 2 minutes of kneading there are still loose particles of flour, add water by the droplet. The starter should be a rough dough that is very stiff but holds together, with no loose flour particles. It will measure a rounded 1/3 cup and weigh 3.5 ounces/100 grams., Transfer the starter to an oiled 1-cup glass measure. Oil the top and press it down into the cup. It should measure about 1/3 cup in the glass measure. Cover the measuring cup tightly with greased plastic wrap and let rise (ideally at 75°to 80°F) until it has doubled, to 2/3 cup, 6 to 8 hours., 2. Give the starter the second feeding and allow the yeast to ferment and rise (you will be increasing it by 4 times, from 50 grams to 200 grams). Tear off a scant 1/4 cup (1.75 ounces/50 grams) of the starter and discard the remainder. Tear the starter into a few pieces and place in a medium bowl. Add the remaining 2/3 cup (3.5 ounces/100 grams) flour and 3 1/2 tablespoons (1.75 ounces/50 grams) water. With a wooden spoon and then your hand, mix and knead together until all the flour is absorbed. If after about 2 minutes of kneading there are still loose particles of flour, add water by the droplet. The starter should be a rough dough that is very stiff but holds together, with no loose flour particles. You will have a full 3/4 cup (7 ounces/200 grams)., Transfer the starter to an oiled 2-cup glass measure. Oil the top and press it down into the cup. It should measure about 3/4 cup in the glass measure. Cover the measuring cup tightly with greased plastic wrap and let rise (ideally at 75°to 80°F) until it has doubled, to 1 1/2 cups, about 6 hours. Refrigerate the starter if you are not ready to mix the dough—up to 20 hours., 3. Mix the dough., Mixer Method If you have refrigerated the starter, remove it to room temperature 1 hour before mixing the dough., In the mixer bowl, place the flour. With the dough hook, on low speed (#2 if using a KitchenAid), gradually add the water until the flour is moistened enough to form a rough dough. Continue kneading on low speed for 3 minutes, enough to develop the gluten structure a little. Scrape down any bits of dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes., With oiled fingers, tear off 2/3 cup (5.25 ounces/150 grams) of the starter; discard the rest. Tear it into 4 pieces, roughly the same size. On low speed, knead it into the dough, about 2 minutes. Add the salt and continue kneading for 1 minute. Raise the speed to medium (#4 KitchenAid) and knead for 3 minutes. The dough will be barely tacky (sticky), smooth, and very elastic. If it is still very sticky, knead in a little flour. If it is not at all sticky, spray it with a little water and knead it. (The dough will measure about 2 cups and weigh about 17.7 ounces/502 grams.), Hand Method If it has been refrigerated, remove the starter to room temperature 1 hour before mixing the dough., With oiled fingers, tear off 2/3 cup (5.25 ounces/150 grams) of the starter; discard the rest. Tear it into 4 pieces, roughly the same size, and place it in a mixing bowl., With a wooden spoon, stir in the water, stirring for a few seconds to soften the starter, then add all but 2 tablespoons of the flour and the salt. Continuing with the wooden spoon or using your hand, mix until the flour is moistened. Knead the dough in the bowl until it comes together, then scrape it onto a lightly floured counter. Knead the dough for 5 minutes, enough to develop the gluten structure a little, adding as little of the reserved 2 tablespoons flour as possible to keep it from sticking. (To prevent sticking, it helps to use your fingertips, not the palms of your hands.) Use a bench scraper to scrape up the dough and gather it together as you knead it. At this point, it will be very sticky. Cover it with the inverted bowl and allow it to rest for 20 minutes. (This rest will make the dough less sticky and easier to work with.), Knead the dough for another 5 to 10 minutes or until it is very smooth and elastic. It should be barely tacky (sticky) to the touch. If the dough is still very sticky, add some or all of the remaining reserved flour or a little extra. (The dough will measure about 2 cups and weigh about 17.7 ounces/502 grams.), Both Methods 4. Let the dough rise. Using an oiled spatula or dough scraper, scrape the dough into a 4-cup glass measuring cup or 1-quart food storage container, lightly greased with cooking spray or oil. Press down the dough so you can get an accurate measure, and lightly spray or oil the top. It will come to 2 cups. Cover the measuring cup with plastic wrap; or cover the container with a lid and, with a piece of tape, mark the side of the container at approximately where double the height of the dough would be. Allow the dough to rise (ideally at 75°to 80°F) for 1 hour. It will only have risen a little., Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured counter. Gently push it down to deflate it, and stretch it into a rectangle (the exact size is not important). Give it 2 business letter turns. It will be soft and stretchy but a little firmer after each turn. Return the dough to the greased container and lightly spray or oil the top. Cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap and allow it to rise for another hour., Stretch the dough again, give it 2 business letter turns, and return it to the container. Grease the top, cover, and allow it to rise until doubled, to 4 cups (1 quart), 4 to 5 hours., 5. Shape the dough and let it rise. Without deflating it, turn the dough out onto a floured counter and round it into a ball (see page 65). Set it in a floured banneton or a colander lined with a floured towel, seam side up. Pinch together the seam if it starts to pull apart. In the banneton, the dough will be about 2 inches from the top., Spray the dough with oil or sprinkle lightly with flour and cover it with a large container or plastic wrap. Let the dough rise ideally at (75deg;to 80°F.) until almost doubled, 3 to 4 hours. When it is pressed gently with a fingertip, the depression will very slowly fill in. In the banneton, the center of the dough will be 3/4 to 1 inch from the top., 6. Preheat the oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F 1 hour before baking. Have an oven shelf at the lowest level and place an oven stone or baking sheet on it, and a cast-iron skillet or sheet pan on the floor of the oven, before preheating., 7. Slash and bake the dough. Very gently invert the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. (If you are using a colander and the risen bread is more than 1 inch below the top, you will need to support the bread when inverting it so that it doesn't fall and deflate. Cut a cardboard circle small enough to fit into the colander and touch the surface of the bread. Place a piece of parchment on top of the bread, place the cardboard on top, and invert it onto the cardboard. Then slide the bread, still on the parchment, onto the baking sheet.) For a more evenly rounded bread, it's fine to leave the dough unslashed. If you like the rustic appearance of a slashed top crust, with sharp scissors, sharp knife, or a single-edged razor blade, slash a 1/4-inch-deep cross in the dough. Because the skin of the dough is very dry, it will be difficult to slash; use a gentle hand so as not to deflate the dough., Quickly but gently set the baking sheet on the hot baking stone or hot baking sheet. Toss 1/2 cup of ice cubes into the pan beneath and immediately shut the door. Bake for 5 minutes. Lower the oven to 450°F and continue baking for 10 minutes. With a heavy pancake turner, lift the bread from the pan and set it directly on the stone, turning it around as you do so for even baking. Continue baking for 10 to 15 minutes or until the crust is deeply burnished and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read about 212°F). For a very crisp crust, prop the open door slightly ajar for the last 5 minutes of baking., 8. Cool the bread. Remove the bread from the oven, and transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely., Quicker Sourdough Bread (with added commercial yeast) If your schedule requires speeding up the process (by about 25 percent), or if you feel more secure with the added reliability of commercial yeast, you can add up to 0.06 percent of the total weight of the flour in this recipe (including the flour contained in the starter). The total weight is 300 grams; 0.06 percent of 300 grams is about 0.2 gram or about 1/16 teaspoon instant yeast. This should be added after the autolyse (the 20-minute rest before the final mixing). At this low a percentage, it will not affect the acidity or flavor of the sourdough, but if it were added at the beginning, the commercial yeast would likely be killed by the acidity of the sourdough starter., Basic Sourdough Bread with Extra Flavor and Keeping Quality If desired, you can replace 2 tablespoons (0.7 ounce/20 grams) of the bread flour with an equal measure or weight of whole wheat, kamut, or rye flour. (This is 6.5 percent of the total amount of flour in the recipe.), French Country Boule Reduce the bread flour in the dough to 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (4.5 ounces/130 grams) and add 1/3 cup (1.5 ounces/40 grams) medium rye flour and 3 tablespoons (1 ounce/30 grams) whole wheat flour. Also add 1 tablespoon of water., In a very cold room, when yeast will take a long time to ferment, or a very warm one, when yeast will take a shorter time to ferment, you may want to adjust the amount of sourdough starter used in the dough., To reduce the amount of stiff sourdough starter from 30 percent to 20 percent: Reduce the starter to a rounded 1/3 cup (3.5 ounces/100 grams). To the rest of the dough, add 1 full tablespoon (about 1 ounce/16.6 grams) water and 3 1/2 tablespoons (1 full ounce/33.3 grams) flour., To increase the amount of stiff sourdough starter from 30 percent to 40 percent: Increase the starter to a full 3/4 cup (7 ounces/200 grams). From the rest of the dough, subtract 1 full tablespoon (about 1 ounce/16.6 grams) water and 3 1/2 tablespoons (1 full ounce/33.3 grams) flour., • If you need more starter-to make 2 loaves at once, for ­example—in Step 2, rather than discarding half, use the full 100 grams and increase it to 400 grams., Flour: 100% Water: 68% Dough Starter: 30% Salt: 2%","[('sourdough starter', 0.33, 'cup'), ('bread flour', 7.0, 'ounces'), ('water', 0.5, 'cup'), ('bread flour', 7.0, 'ounces'), ('water', 0.375, 'cup'), ('stiff sourdough starter', 5.25, 'ounces'), ('salt', 0.25, 'teaspoon')]"
