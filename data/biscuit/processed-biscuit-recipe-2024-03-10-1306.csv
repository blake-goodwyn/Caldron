Add a large pinch of baking soda to the buttermilk., After 15 minutes, take the bowl from the freezer and add 3/4 cup buttermilk. Stir just until it is  mixed. Don't over-mix. Add additional buttermilk a little at a time until a stiff but sticky dough just forms. Over mixing will make them tough and dense. Leave the dough a little stickier than you think because you will be adding more flour on the counter., Flour your counter and hands. Take dough from bowl, place on counter and fold in half, very gently, 6-8 times, no more. Be extra careful not to handle the dough very much. The dough will be rough looking, not smooth like bread dough. This is what you want., Flatten dough gently with hands to about 1 to 1 1/2 inches high. I use a small glass, 2 1/2"" in diameter. Push straight down once. Do not twist or edges will seal and they will not rise when baked. Extra dough can be patted gently back together once or twice and re-cut. *Never use a rolling pin.

Serve warm., Note: This recipe doubles very well. Every time that I make these, I always double this recipe. To double, simply double all the ingredients. Also, the key to high-rise, flaky biscuits is having really fresh baking powder and not overworking the dough. Even if your baking powder is not expired, the biscuits will not rise if the baking powder has clumps inside the container. Also, I cannot emphasize enough to just lightly knead the dough 10 times; over-kneading will produce a tough biscuit. When you pat the dough to ¾ inch thickness, the baking powder will already be activating the dough to rise. Do not re-pat the dough down again because the air bubbles forming will make the biscuits flaky., Betty Crocker's Tips for Biscuits: Tip One: One secret to making flaky biscuits is thoroughly blending or ""cutting in"" the shortening and dry ingredients. A pastry blender, which breaks the shortening into little lumps works great for cutting inches If you don't have one, you can crisscross two table knives through the flour and shortening or use a wire whisk., Tip Two: Use a biscuit cutter dipped in flour to cut the dough, pushing the cutter straight down through the dough. If you twist as you cut, the biscuits will be uneven. Cut the biscuits as close together as possible. If you don't have a biscuit cutter, use the end of an open 6-ounce juice can or other narrow can or glass, or use cookie cutters for fun shapes. Dip in flour before cutting.","[('flour', 2.0, 'cups'), ('sugar', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('baking powder', 4.0, 'teaspoons'), ('salt', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('shortening', 0.5, 'cup'), ('milk', 0.75, 'cup')]"

Set aside., In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut the butter into tablespoons and add into the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour until pea-sized. In a measuring cup, measure out the buttermilk and heavy cream. If using a lower fat buttermilk, adjust the proportions to use a bit more heavy cream. (The liquids should still measure 1 cup.) Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the liquid mixture. Using a large pastry fork or spoon, gently stir together until a shaggy mass forms. The dough is more wet than it is dry., Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Add a bit of flour to your hands and gently press the dough into a rectangle (about 8″ x 5″). Use enough flour to keep things from sticking and no more. The goal is to add as little additional flour as possible. Using a pastry bench, cut the dough in half. Slide the pastry bench beneath and stack the two. Repeat. Gently press the dough out once more until about 1.5″ thick. Using a 3″ (or so) biscuit cutter, press straight down without a twisting motion to cut out the biscuits. Place on a baking sheet. Repeat and place additional biscuits close to one another so that they’ll rub shoulders while baking. Stack the leftover dough making sure the layers are parallel. Gently press out again and cut until most of the dough has been used., Using the tiny bit of liquid left in the measuring cup (add a little cream if the cup is dry), lightly brush the tops of the biscuits. Bake for 12-15 minutes until the tops are golden and the sides look baked through. Serve warm., To reheat, preheat oven to 350°. Get a paper towel damp.

Add the chilled butter pieces to the flour mixture. Use a pastry blender, fork, or fingers to cut butter into the flour until small, pea-size pieces remain., In a separate small bowl whisk together the yogurt, egg, oil, and lemon juice. Stir the yogurt mixture into the flour mixture until no flour pockets remain and thoroughly combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit for 30 minutes at room temperature. This allows the starches to blend with the liquid, making the dough tender and easier to shape. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425ºF., Place one baking sheet inside a second so you have a double layer, and line the top baking sheet with parchment paper. Grease a ⅓ cup measuring cup and scoop a heaping amount of biscuit dough into it, pressing down slightly. Drop onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing biscuits about 1 inch apart in the center of the sheet (this traps a little extra steam between the biscuits and makes them more tender).

If you don’t have an iron skillet lightly grease a round cake pan or small cookie sheet. I don’t recommend buttering your skillet or pan. Butter causes biscuits to brown too much on the bottom before the tops get brown enough. I always use solid Crisco shortening to grease my pan, but liquid shortening should work too., Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar to a large bowl. Use a fork or whisk to thoroughly combine the dry ingredients., Cut the stick of butter into 3 long pieces. Flip the butter over one turn and repeat. (see picture above). Now slice the butter off into small chunks and transfer them to the bowl of flour. Using a pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour until the butter is about the size of peas., Make a well in the center of the flour and pour 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons of buttermilk into the well. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, gently fold the flour into the buttermilk and mix just slightly until all of the flour is wet. It’s important to not overwork the dough. Overworking the dough will result in tough biscuits., Transfer the dough to a floured work surface. Using floured hands, pat the dough into a rectangle, about 8 x 10 inches or so. It doesn’t have to be a specific size, just big enough to fold. Gently fold one side of the dough into the center, then fold the other side into the center. Turn the dough so that it’s horizontally in front of you. Lightly press the dough out into a rectangle again. Turn one side of the dough into the center, then the other. Repeat this process one more time, a total of 3 times., Using your hands, pat the dough into a rectangle, about 3/4″ in thickness. You can use a rolling pin if you prefer. Using a sharp biscuit cutter, cut the biscuits by cutting down through the dough and straight up. It’s important to not twist the cutter. Cut them as close together as possible. Gather up any scraps and rework the dough as little as possible and cut out with the cutter. Try to use a cutter that is at least 2.25 inches in diameter if you want pretty good sized biscuits. I used a 3-inch cutter., Transfer the biscuit rounds to the greased skillet or pan, making sure they are close together with sides touching.

To the chamber of your flour sifter add all of your dry ingredients – the flour, the baking soda, the baking powder, and fine sea salt, if using. Sift the dry ingredients together – discard anything in the sifter that’s too large to get through the mesh – and set the sifter aside., Tap the bottom of the bowl on the counter to help level out the flour mixture. Sprinkle the pats of butter all over the surface of the flour, keeping them as separate as you can for as long as you can. After all the butter is in the bowl use your fingers to lightly toss them together, just so that the butter pieces are all coated in flour., Now, use a pastry cutter – or your fingers, or a back of a fork – to work the frozen butter into the flour. Keep working until there are no pieces of butter any larger than a pea. The mixture should resemble cornmeal., Using a wooden spoon or silicone spatula make a well in the center of the bowl and pour the buttermilk into this well. Use the utensil to push the flour from the edges over the top of the buttermilk, almost as if you’re tucking it in or trying to hide it. Try not to disturb the buttermilk while you do this., Once the buttermilk is mostly covered, go ahead and being folding the wet and dry together into a dough. Scrape your utensil along the sides of the bowl, then bring that flour into the center and pull the utensil out of the bowl. Turn the bowl clockwise about a quarter of the way, then do that again. After you’ve scraped the sides of the bowl down, scrape the bottom of the bowl and turn that over onto itself. It shouldn’t take you more than 10 stirs or so to make a very shaggy dough. It doesn’t need to look cohesive, just as long as there are no large spots of buttermilk or large spots of dry flour., Grab your biscuit cutter and put that in the bowl. Stick the entire mixing bowl into the fridge to chill while you prepare to make the biscuits. Keeping them cold the entire time before they reach the oven is important! Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper and set it aside. Put a little bit of flour in a small bowl – you’ll use this to flour your biscuit cutter between cuts – and sprinkle a fairly generous amount, about a teaspoon or so, onto your work surface., At this point go ahead and turn on the oven and preheat it to 450°F. Turn the dough out onto the floured work surface and use your fingertips to pat the mound down and out. Don’t use extra pressure, just let the natural weight of your hands do the work for you. Once you’ve patted the dough out so that it’s about a 1/2 inch high all the way across it’s time to cut out the biscuits., Stick the biscuit cutter into the small bowl of flour, and dust off the excess. Press the biscuit cutter straight down without twisting or turning it and use your weight to ensure the biscuit cutter gets all the way through the dough, to the surface underneath. Without turning the biscuit cutter or taking the pressure off of the counter, begin moving the biscuit cutter in small tight circles. This will help the biscuit release from the cutter and the counter, and stay in a round shape. Repeat this process until you’ve cut as many biscuits out of the dough as you can. Use your bench scraper to help lift the biscuits up and transfer them to the prepared baking sheet, making sure they’re all touching just a bit., Take the remaining dough and push it together. I like to use the bench scraper to do this and keep my hands clean. You just want to push the dough together, you don’t need to lift it or anything. Just push it together so it’s stuck. Pat it back down until it’s 1/2″ high again, then cut out as many more biscuits as you can. Repeat if needed., Baste the biscuits lightly with the melted butter, then bake the biscuits in the top half of the oven for 12-15 minutes, until deeply golden browned and cooked through. Baste them with the remaining melted butter as soon as they come out of the oven.

Don't allow the lemon curd to come to a boil – you shouldn't see any bubbles forming., Once thickened, remove from the heat and stir in the butter until it's fully melted., Pass the lemon curd though a fine mesh sieve to remove the lemon zest – this will make it perfectly smooth and creamy (but you can skip this step if you don't mind the texture of the lemon zest).Tip: I don't recommend using a metal sieve, as contact with metal can give your lemon curd a slight metallic aftertaste. If possible, use a sieve with a plastic or silicone mesh., Pour the finished lemon curd into a bowl or heat-proof container and cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap/cling film. Make sure that the plastic wrap/cling film is in direct contact with the surface of the lemon curd – this will prevent skin formation. Allow to cool completely to room temperature. (You can also prepare the lemon curd a day or two in advance and keep it in the fridge until needed.), Lemon cookie dough:, Add the sugar and lemon zest to a large bowl, and use your fingertips to rub the zest into the sugar. Tip: This helps to release more essential oils from the zest, and it will make your cookies even more lemony and aromatic., Add the melted butter, eggs, lemon juice and vanilla, and whisk well until combined., In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder and salt, and add them to the wet ingredients., Mix with a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula until you get a smooth, batter-like cookie dough.Tip: At this stage, the cookie dough will really be more like a batter – it will be very loose, soft and sticky, bordering on runny. That's how it should be. Don't add more flour!, Chill the cookie dough in the fridge for at least 2 hours before proceeding to the next step. You can also keep it in the fridge overnight if you want to bake the cookies the next day.Tip: In addition to firming up the cookie dough into something you can actually handle and shape into balls, chilling also ensures that the cookies won’t melt into puddles during baking., Assembling & baking the cookies:, Adjust the oven rack to the middle position, pre-heat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC) and line two large baking sheets with parchment/baking paper.Tip: You will bake the cookies in two batches, so you can line two baking sheets if you have them on hand. Otherwise, just re-use the same baking sheet, but make sure to cool it completely before you place the next batch of unbaked cookies onto it., Use a 2-tablespoon cookie or ice cream scoop to scoop out a portion of the cookie dough. Drop it directly into a bowl of powdered/icing sugar and roll it around until it’s evenly coated. The sugar coating will allow you to handle the cookie dough without it sticking, so you can roll it between your palms to form a perfectly round ball.Repeat with the rest of the cookie dough, you should get 16 cookies in total., Place the sugar-coated cookie dough balls onto the lined baking sheets, with plenty of space between them, about 8 per baking sheet (as the cookies will spread during baking)., Use a ½-tablespoon measuring spoon to make an indent in the centre of each cookie dough ball (make sure that you press only halfway through each cookie dough ball, not all the way through)., Fill the cookies with about 1 (generous) teaspoon of lemon curd., Bake one baking sheet at a time at 350ºF (180ºC) for 9-12 minutes or until the cookies have spread and cracked around the edges and the lemon curd centre is slightly puffed up but NOT visibly bubbling (this will ensure that it stays beautifully smooth and creamy).While the first batch of cookies is baking, keep the second baking sheet with the cookies in the fridge until needed., The cookies will be very soft and delicate immediately out of the oven. Allow them to cool on the baking sheet for about 5-10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely., These lemon curd cookies are amazing both warm and at room temperature, but I find them to be at their very best when they're chilled from the fridge., Storage:, The gluten free lemon curd cookies keep well in an airtight container at room temperature for 2-3 days, or in the fridge for up to about 1 week., You might have some lemon curd left over – you can store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to about 10 days.","[('sugar', 100.0, 'g'), ('lemon', 1.0, None), ('egg yolks', 3.0, None), ('salt', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('lemon juice', 60.0, 'g'), ('butter', 55.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 150.0, 'g'), ('lemons', 2.0, None), ('butter', 115.0, 'g'), ('eggs', 2.0, None), ('lemon juice', 30.0, 'g'), ('vanilla bean paste', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('flour blend', 240.0, 'g'), ('xanthan gum', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('baking powder', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('salt', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('powdered sugar', 90.0, 'g')]"

The butter will begin to crackle, and then eventually foam. Make sure you whisk constantly during this process. After a couple of minutes, the butter will begin to brown and turn a nice golden amber color on the bottom of the saucepan. Continue to whisk and remove from heat as soon as the butter begins to brown and give off a nutty aroma. Immediately transfer the butter to a medium bowl to prevent burning.

You might need to take out the dough and thaw it out a bit before measuring the dough if it is super hard and you did not already roll the cookie dough into balls. This should take about 20 minutes.

To do this, press down on the fat with the wires of the pastry blender or the tines of a fork as you move it around the bowl.

Using a bench knife (or a metal spatula can be helpful if you do not have a bench knife), fold the dough in half and then turn it 90 degrees. Pat out and fold again for a total of 6 times. This process is creating layers that will create flaky biscuits., Press the dough out to about 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick and use a round cutter that is about 2.5-inches (6 cm) in diameter to cut out your biscuits. When cutting out, dip your cutter in flour, press straight down, and pull it back up without twisting it. Twisting can seal the edge of your biscuit, not allowing it to rise fully. Gently pat the scraps together to cut out the rest of your biscuits. Alternatively, you can pat the dough into a rectangle and use a sharp knife to divide the dough into 8 rectangular-shaped biscuits., Place the biscuits in the prepared cast iron pan or baking sheet with the edges touching so they will rise up against each other., As an optional step, place the pan in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking. This will ensure that your biscuits will not spread too much and will allow your oven to fully pre-heat., Bake at 450°F/230°C for 13-15 minutes until golden brown.

Melt the butter in a wide stainless steel skillet over medium heat. Swirl the pan a few times as the butter melts. It will get bubbly and then foamy – use a heat-proof spatula to scrape the butter across the bottom of the pan to prevent burning. You’ll see the butter start to turn golden brown very quickly, and you’ll be able to smell it (yum). When it is a nice golden brown color, remove from heat and transfer to a cool bowl or glass measuring cup, being careful not to burn it. The whole process should take about 5 minutes. Let the butter cool for another 5-10 minutes while you measure and prep everything else., Add the butter, sugars, and vanilla to the bowl of an electric mixer.

Without chilling, the piped cookies will over-spread. If you chill the dough prior to shaping, the dough will be too cold/stiff to pipe., Line 2–3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats, or leave unlined. If unlined, do not grease the pan., In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract, and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine., On low speed, beat in the flour and salt. Turn up to high speed and beat until completely combined. On medium speed, beat in 1.5 Tablespoons of milk. You want a dough that’s creamy and pipe-able (but still thick), so you may need up to 2–2.5 Tablespoons of milk. The more milk you add, the more the cookies will spread, so chilling in step 6 is imperative. I recommend keeping the amount of milk small and using a large enough piping tip, like the ones I suggest in the post above., Add your large piping tip to the piping bag. Spoon a little bit of dough into the piping bag and pipe a 1–2-inch swirl or line on the prepared baking sheet. The reason I suggest only a little bit of dough to start is because the dough may still be too thick to pipe. If it’s too thick, transfer that dough back to the mixing bowl and add another 1/2 Tablespoon of milk. If the dough is creamy enough to pipe, continue piping the dough in 1–2-inch swirls or lines, 3 inches apart on the baking sheet. See video for a visual if needed. If desired, place a maraschino cherry in the center of the swirl or sprinkle the dough with sprinkles and/or coarse sugar., Transfer the baking sheet to the refrigerator and chill the shaped cookies for 20–30 minutes., Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C)., Bake the chilled cookies for 12–15 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The cookies will spread like all cookies do, but not completely lose their shape, especially if you chilled the shaped dough. If the cookies are smaller, they will take closer to 12 minutes. Keep your eye on them. They’re done when the edges lightly brown., Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely., Optional Chocolate, You can melt the chocolate in a double boiler or the microwave. If using the microwave: place the chopped chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Melt in 20-second increments in the microwave, stirring after each increment until completely melted and smooth. Dip the cookies in chocolate and top with sprinkles, if desired. Allow the chocolate to set completely at room temperature for about 1 hour or in the refrigerator for 20 minutes., Plain cookies stay fresh in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and then set aside., Combine dry ingredients & butter, You can do this 2 ways: in the body of a food processor or in a large bowl. In the body of a food processor, combine 3 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, salt, and cubed butter. Pulse the mixture together until the butter is fully incorporated within the flour mixture. Then empty this mixture into a large bowl. Alternatively, in a large mixing bowl, combine 3 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, granulated sugar, and sea salt, and whisk until well blended. Add the butter into the bowl and toss to coat. Then use a pastry blender to cut the butter into the flour, or pinch it with your fingertips, smearing the butter into the flour. Continue this process until you see shaggy flecks throughout the flour., Add liquid & berries, Pour in buttermilk and cream, along with the diced strawberries. Gently mix, bringing the dough together in a cohesive mass. If the biscuit dough feels excessively sticky, add an additional ¼ cup of flour, working it in until combined., Transfer to work surface, Dust your work surface with a bit of flour and turn the dough out of the bowl onto the surface. Use lightly floured hands to gently shape the dough, using the heel of your palms to work the dough just until you’ve got a fully incorporated mass, careful not to overwork., Roll out & cut biscuits, Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough into a 6 by 13-inch rectangle, until about 1-inch thick. Use a round 3-inch biscuit cutter to stamp out biscuits. (Tip: Do not twist the biscuit cutter. The twisting motion seals the biscuit edges which can cause the biscuits to not achieve a good enough rise). This recipe makes 12 biscuits (with the tiniest bit of scraps left over), re-roll and stamp dough as needed until you have 12 biscuits., Freeze biscuits, Place the shaped biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet, arranging them about a ½-inch apart so the biscuits have room to puff up and rise. Then place them into the freezer to chill for at least 15 minutes while the oven is still preheating. >> Note: do not skip the freezing step. After working the dough, the butter will have softened and the chill time ensures that the butter solidifies again. Plus, the colder they are, the higher they rise…chilled biscuits, chef’s kiss!, Brush & bake, Take biscuits out of the freezer. Use a pastry brush to brush the top of each biscuit with a bit of buttermilk. Bake the frozen biscuits for 20 minutes, rotating the baking sheet at the halfway mark, until the biscuits have risen and have golden brown tops., Glaze & serve, To make the icing: In a small bowl, combine the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract (if using).

Set aside for about 5-10 minutes, until the raisins have plumped up and re-hydrated.Drain the water, making sure to squeeze out any excess water from the raisins. Set aside until needed., In a large bowl, whisk together the softened butter, light brown sugar, granulated sugar and orange zest until pale and somewhat fluffy (but no need to get it super fluffy, like you might when making a sponge cake or buttercream). You can do this by hand using a balloon whisk, with a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or with a hand mixer fitted with the double beaters.Tip: You can rub the orange zest into the granulated sugar with your fingertips before adding them to the rest of the ingredients, as that helps to release the essential oils from the zest and makes the cookies even more fragrant., Add the egg and vanilla, and whisk until combined., In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, and add them to the butter-sugar mixture., Use a rubber spatula or a wooden spoon to mix it all together until you get a smooth dough. Note that the dough will be VERY soft and sticky at this stage., Add the oats, re-hydrated raisins and chopped walnuts. Mix it all together until combined and the add-ins are evenly distributed within the cookie dough., Chill the cookie dough in the fridge for about 30-45 minutes.Tip: If you like your oatmeal cookies thinner and crisper, you can skip this chilling step. If you prefer them thicker and chewier, you can chill them for up to 1 hour. See the blog post for more details and photos., While the cookie dough is chilling, adjust the oven rack to the middle position, pre-heat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC) and line 2-3 large baking sheets with baking/parchment paper.Tip: You will bake the cookies in several batches, so you can line 2-3 baking sheets if you have them on hand. Otherwise, just re-use the same baking sheet, but make sure to cool it completely before you place the next batch of unbaked cookies onto it., Once chilled, use a ""2 tablespoon"" ice cream or cookie scoop to scoop individual portions (balls) of cookie dough onto the lined baking sheets. You should get 18 cookies in total. Make sure to leave plenty of space around the cookies on the baking sheet, as they will spread out during baking – I usually fit about 6-8 cookies per baking sheet., Bake the oatmeal cookies, one baking sheet at a time, at 350ºF (180ºC) for 10-12 minutes or until they are light golden brown around the edges. The centres of the cookies will look under-baked (their tops will be very soft and shiny) – that's okay. They should and have to look underbaked if you want to get the perfect soft and chewy texture.Tip: If your cookies aren’t perfectly round, you can correct their shape while they’re still very hot immediately out of the oven. Take a round cookie cutter that’s larger than the cookie diameter, and use it to nudge or scoot the cookies into a more round shape., Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for at least 5-10 minutes before transferring them onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely.Tip: As the cookies cool, they will set and lose their under-baked appearance. They will end up perfectly soft and chewy., Storage:, These gluten free oatmeal cookies keep well stored in an airtight container at room temperature for about 1 week., Making ahead & freezing:, If you’re making these cookies exclusively with the intention to freeze them for baking later, you can make them with about 20-30g (3-4 tablespoons) of gluten free flour blend less than is required in the recipe below., Then, chill the cookie dough in the fridge until it’s firm enough to scoop, and freeze the scooped-out balls of cookie dough (in an airtight container or a ziplock bag) until you want to bake them.Tip: By adding less flour, you’re ensuring that the cookies will spread out properly, even after you’ve kept them in the freezer for a few weeks. Over time, the oats absorb more and more of the moisture in the cookie dough – that's why you need to use less flour if you'll be keeping the unbaked cookies for a longer period of time., Bake them directly from frozen, you might need to bake them for a few minutes longer to account for the extra thawing time in the oven.","[('raisins', 80.0, 'g'), ('butter', 113.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 100.0, 'g'), ('sugar', 50.0, 'g'), ('orange', 1.0, None), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('vanilla bean paste', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('flour blend', 135.0, 'g'), ('xanthan gum', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('baking powder', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('baking soda', 0.25, 'tsp'), ('salt', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('cinnamon', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('rolled oats', 135.0, 'g'), ('walnuts', 60.0, 'g')]"

Clear out space in your freezer, if possible.Use a spoon to create small balls of filling, about the size of a marble. Line them up on the prepared pan, you should have quite a few (see photos). Place in the freezer if you can fit it in. Freeze for 20 minutes until hardened. If you only have room in the fridge, you will have to wait about an hour or two until they are firm., Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and prepare a couple more baking sheets with parchment paper, or line with a silicone mat. (You can use the pan in the freezer to bake later, too), Make the dough. In the same large bowl or stand mixer (no need to wash it), beat 1 cup butter for a couple minutes until smooth, scraping the sides and bottom a few times in between., Add 1 and 2/3 cup white sugar. Beat for 2 minutes, taking the time to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl in between. Your butter and sugar should be light and fluffy with no chunks at all., Add 2 eggs and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Beat well, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl. Make sure you beat it long enough that it becomes smooth and homogenous., Add 3 and 1/2 cups flour but don't mix it in yet (make sure you spoon and level your flour)., Use a small spoon (I use my teaspoon) to stir in 1 teaspoon baking soda, 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1 and 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar into the flour. Gently beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Don't overdo it. There should still be flour streaks when you stop your mixer. Use a spatula to scrape down the edges of the bowl., Continue beating just a few more seconds until all the flour streaks are gone. Do not over mix! You want to make sure all the ingredients are combined, but once that is done, stop mixing. Over mixing dough = tough cookies., Mix in. Once your small balls of cinnamon filling are frozen and firm, you can add them to the dough. Do not use a stand mixer or hand mixer. Instead, fold them in with a wooden spoon or a spatula., Use a large cookie scoop or a spoon to shape the dough. You want dough balls that are about 2 inches across. I used this cookie scoop. and overfilled it slightly for each scoop. See photos., Roll the cookies. In a small or medium bowl, add 1/3 cup sugar and 1 and 1/2 tablespoons cinnamon. Stir together. Roll the shaped cookies in the cinnamon-sugar to coat., Place cookie dough balls on the prepared baking sheet with about 2 inches in between them. I can fit 12 cookies on an 11x17 baking sheet. But as you can see from the photos, they kind of run into each other. You can fix this with the spooning technique, but if you want to play it safe add 8 cookies to a pan., Bake the cookies at 350 for about 11-12 minutes. These cookies are not going to look done when you take them out of the oven because the cinnamon filling will stay shiny. The edges of the cookies that DON'T have cinnamon filling pooling out the side should be firm but not golden. The top (white) part of the cookies should be matte (not shiny), at least on the outer edges. The cinnamon filling will be shiny and may or may not be spreading quite a bit. You might think these cookies are going to flatten out and crisp up and fail, but never fear, we have a plan:, Shape the cookies. Immediately after taking the cookies out of the oven (like seriously, within 30-60 seconds before the edges crisp), use a couple spoons to push the edges of the cookies toward their centers. Shape them back into the circle that they were meant to be. See photos! Scrape up all that oozing cinnamon sugar goodness and pack it into the edge of the cookies, pushing the cookies in on themselves. This makes the cookies thicker, chewier, and solves the problem of the cinnamon filling spreading everywhere., Let the cookies set up on the pan for at least 5 minutes. Remove the cookies to a wire rack. Then eat one as fast as you can with a glass of milk! Cinnamon roll blissss!! Don't forget to try out my regular Snickerdoodle recipe sometime, it's almost the same recipe but instead of the cinnamon filling, it gets double dipped in cinnamon-sugar before and after baking. They are perfectly soft and chewy!, Freezer instructions: You can freeze this dough and bake later! I like to shape the dough into balls, roll them in cinnamon sugar, and store them in a ziplock bag.

It’s a 1:1 GF flour, so it’s an even swap., Use a cookie scoop to portion the sticky dough.","Preheat the oven to 325 F/160 C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper., Slice the almond paste into chunks (it’s easier to blend this way). Add to the bowl of a food processor with the sugar and almond extract. Blend until combined- the texture should look like wet sand., In a separate small bowl, whisk the egg whites until very frothy., Add the egg whites and flour to the food processor. Briefly run the machine until a smooth dough forms. Let the dough rest for 1-2 minutes for the flour to absorb the liquid. The dough should feel soft, slightly sticky, but mostly tacky. If it’s very sticky, almost wet or loose, add a sprinkle of flour and briefly pulse again., Add the pine nuts to a wide shallow bowl., Portion the dough, in tablespoon-sized scoops into the pine nuts (I use this cookie scoop for convenience)., Roll the dough to fully coat the top, bottom and sides. Place onto your parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat to roll and coat the remaining cookie dough. Note: the dough balls can be chilled overnight at this point. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to bake., Place the baking sheet on the center rack. Bake for 20 minutes for soft and chewy cookies (check at the 18 minute mark). They will be light golden around the edges, and pale and soft in the center. They might look slightly underdone, but this is what you want. The texture will continue to firm up once removed from the oven. For crispier cookies bake for 23-25 minutes., Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Cool for 10 minutes, and then transfer the cookies to a wire rack to finish cooling., Sprinkle with powdered sugar, if desired., Storage Options:, Airtight Container, Place cooled pignoli cookies in an airtight container or a zip-top bag.

In second large bowl, with an electric mixer, cream the sour cream and butter at low speed; add sugar, eggs, and vanilla & mix until combined. (It's okay if it's a little lumpy as long as no butter chunks are visible.) Gradually add the flour mixture to the sour cream mixture, mixing until well combined. Dough will be sticky. (If cookie dough is too thick for your mixture to handle, you can stir it by hand with a wooden spoon.)

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. Generously flour your counter or work surface to prevent dough from sticking. Rub flour on the rolling pin. Put one of the chilled pieces of dough on top of the floured surface and sprinkle the top of the dough with more flour. Starting at the center, roll the dough out to one edge; return to the center and roll to the opposite edge. Continue rolling until dough is an even 1/4"" thick all over, sprinkling with additional flour, if needed, to avoid sticking. Dip cookie cutter in flour and cut out dough shapes. Transfer dough shapes to baking sheets. Continue rolling dough, cutting shapes, and adding to baking sheets until they are filled. Bake 2 sheets at a time for 8-10 minutes, rotating and switching pans half way through cooking time.

Use an electric mixer to combine ingredients on a low speed until its' a thick paste consistency and all of the lumps are gone. Gradually add remaining milk and continue mixing on medium speed until frosting is a smooth, silky, spreadable consistency. If it's still too thick, add more milk 1/2 teaspoon at a time until it's desired consistency. Mix in food coloring, if desired., FROST & STORE COOKIES:, Frost each cookie and decorate with sprinkles while frosting is still wet.

Gently pat (do not roll with a rolling pin!) the dough to about 1/2-inch thick. Gently fold the dough in half or in thirds, repeating for a total of 4-5 times and pressing it gently to 1-inch thick after the last fold. These folds, combined with the cold butter, are what help to create flaky layers in the biscuits., Use a round biscuit or cookie cutter to cut into circles. Do not turn the cutter while pressing into the dough, just press firmly enough to cut all the way through the dough., Line a large, rimmed cookie sheet with a silpat liner or parchment paper.

The butter should be soft but NOT melty, Crack one whole egg in a bowl and whisk to loosen up the egg. Measure out 25 grams of egg to be used in the recipe. It is important to measure by weight, Mix instant coffee with water and set aside, Prepare cookie dough:, You don't need a mixer to prepare the cookie dough. Mash the softened butter with the brown sugar using a rubber spatula. Then add the room-temperature egg and mix again until combined. Add the instant coffee mixture and vanilla extract and mix again, Sift the dry ingredients into the butter mixture. Add oil. Use a spatula to start mixing. The mixture will still be dry at first. Just keep mixing and when you get a rough dough, meaning you still see some flour here and there, fold in the chocolate chips and continue to mix into a dough. It will be sticky, Chill the cookie dough (do not skip this step), Cover and refrigerate the cookie dough for at least 1 hour. If you can do it overnight, that's even better because the flavor gets even better (I know waiting can be a pain, but this is worth waiting). They can be kept in the fridge for 3-4 days, When ready to bake: (updates on baking temperature and time, read my post above for details), Preheat the oven to 350 F (180 C) for a conventional oven. For a convection oven, lower the temperature by 20 F or 15 C, I no longer recommend baking two trays at one go. It's so hard to get both trays of cookies to turn out right. Everyone's oven is different. Please bake one tray at a time, Line the baking pan with parchment paper, Scoop about 8 grams of the cookie dough and roll into a round ball and put them about 1 inch apart as they will spread some during baking, If the cookies have gotten too soft after all the handling, you can put the whole tray in the freezer again for 15 minutes before baking. This helps to prevent the cookies from spreading too much, UPDATE: I suggest baking 2-3 cookies first and see how they behave (whether they spread too much or not). Some of you have shared with me that your cookies spread more and some didn't spread at all and prefer that they spread a bit more. If they spread too much, you may want to chill the cookie longer and if the cookies don't spread at all, you may not need to chill the dough before baking. It could be that the dough is too cold and or ingredients aren't measured correctly (too much flour, etc)., Bake for 18 minutes for a lighter color pan and about 15 minutes for a darker color pan. The timing is just for your reference. It also depends on how big you size the cookies. You know your oven better and so please adjust accordingly. If you want the cookies really crunchy, add a minute or two (or could be 5 minutes longer, depending on your oven), Cooling:, The cookies appear very soft when they are out from the oven. Let the cookies cool down on the rack for 5 minutes and then remove and cool down completely at a cooling rack. They will crisp up further, If your cookies do not stay crispy after the next day, they can be easily re-crisp in the oven at 350 F (180 C) for 3-5 minutes and then let them cool down and they will be crispy again, Age the cookies for a day:, Usually cookies (or pretty much any baked goods) won't taste as good on the same day you bake them. If you can wait until the next day, you will be rewarded with a much better flavor and texture., Storage:, Store the cookies in an air-tight cookie jar. They can be kept this way at room temperature for weeks (They didn't last more than 3 days at our house!)","[('butter', 125.0, 'gr'), ('sugar', 125.0, 'gr'), ('salt', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('egg', 25.0, 'gr'), ('oil', 25.0, 'gr'), ('flour', 155.0, 'gr'), ('cornstarch', 30.0, 'gr'), ('baking powder', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('baking soda', 0.5, 'tsp'), ('chocolate chips', 175.0, 'gr'), ('instant coffee', 1.0, 'tsp'), ('water', 0.5, 'tsp')]"

Add the sugar and beat on high speed for 2-3 minutes until fluffy and light., Now add in the almond milk, cornstarch, vanilla and almond extract (if using). Beat on high until it is all fully combined, about 1 minute. Scrape the sides of the bowl as needed., Add 1 cup of the flour to the wet mixture. Sprinkle the baking powder and salt on top of the flour. Mix on low speed, until just combined. Now add 1 more cup of the flour and continue to mix on low until just combined; don't over mix. The dough should feel similar to play dough when you work it in your hands, but it will look crumbly in the bowl. If it seems too wet for rolling, add another 1/4 cup of flour. You want the dough to be thick, but not dry. I always use the full 2 1/4 cups of flour. If the dough is too wet, your cookies will spread., Using a spatula, scoop all of the dough out of the bowl; use your hands if needed to push it all together. Divide the dough in half and roll into two balls., On a flat surface, add a sheet of parchment paper. Sprinkle a little flour on it, then add half the dough. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough, and roll it out to about 1/4 inch thickness. Place a sheet of parchment paper on top. Repeat for the second ball of dough, and then stack them with parchment paper. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight., Once the dough has been chilled, set it on the counter for 10 minutes while the oven is preheating to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut into desired shapes using a cookie cutter and place them on the prepared baking sheets. Continue re-rolling the dough until it is all used., Bake for 8-10 minutes, in the middle rack of the oven, until very lightly colored on top and around the edges. They will appear underdone, but they will firm up considerably as they cool. Let them cool for 5 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to let cool completely before icing., Easy Icing, Whisk all icing ingredients in a bowl. If it seems too thick, add a little more almond milk. It should be smooth, glossy and not runny. If too runny, add more powdered sugar. You can dip the cookies in the icing, or use brushes, spoons or a squeeze bottle. See this helpful video on how to decorate sugar cookies with icing., *If you want really pretty cookies, first make the icing thicker, by using only 1 tablespoon of almond milk. Using a decorating tip, outline the cookies with the thicker icing. Then add a little more milk to thin it and flood the inside with icing. This way the icing doesn't spill over the cookie edges., Decorate with sprinkles as desired. The icing will take several hours to harden completely. The cookies will stay soft for about 5 days at room temperature.","[('vegan butter', 3.0, 'cup'), ('sugar', 3.0, 'cup'), ('unsweetened almond milk', 2.0, 'tablespoons'), ('cornstarch', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('almond extract', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('flour', 2.0, 'cups'), ('baking powder', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('powdered sugar', 1.5, 'cups'), ('vanilla extract', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('almond extract', 0.25, 'teaspoon'), ('corn syrup', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('unsweetened almond milk', 1.0, 'tablespoon')]"

Mix on low speed until just combined. Do not over mix., Add the chocolate chips all at once and mix for just 10 seconds to combine. Do not over mix the dough., Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a large cookie scoop to divide the dough into 2 ounce cookie dough balls. Place on a parchment lined baking sheet., Roll the cookie dough balls between the palms of your hands until smooth. Work quickly so that the dough does not get too warm., Place the balls of cookie dough 2 to 3 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Top each ball with a few extra chocolate chips if desired. Bake in the center rack of the oven for 9 to 10 minutes. Check the cookies around 7 minutes into baking. If the cookies are still mounded on top, lift the cookie sheet about 3 to 4 inches above the baking rack and drop it firmly. Repeat if needed. This will flatten out the cookies and help create delicious pools of melted chocolate., The cookies are done when the edges are set and slightly golden brown. The centers of the cookies will still look pale and slightly under baked. Do not overbake the cookies or they will be dry and crispy instead of soft and chewy., Remove the cookies from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 to 10 minutes before carefully transferring to a cooling rack., Sprinkle with flakey sea salt before serving if desired.","[('flour', 345, 'g'), ('cornstarch', 1, 'teaspoon'), ('baking soda', 1, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', 1, 'teaspoon'), ('butter', 226, 'g'), ('brown sugar', 150, 'g'), ('granulated sugar', 130, 'g'), ('egg', 1, None), ('vanilla', 1, 'tablespoon'), ('chocolate chips', 405, 'g'), ('sea salt', None, None)]"

A word about the butter, we use Sweet Cream Salted Butter when we are baking and I think it tastes great with these sugar cookies too. The butter needs to be softened but still cold. A prime culprit for dry sugar cookie dough is butter that is too warm and soft. I let the butter sit out on the counter for just under an hour before I start making the cookies - this seems to be the perfect amount of time for me. The butter is still cold to the touch but you can press into the stick with your fingers. In the past, when in a rush, I have softened the butter in the microwave but inevitably the dough that I get is on the ""crumbly"" side., Cream the butter and sugar until it is completely mixed (3 minutes on medium-high should do the trick.), Add 2 tablespoons of vanilla and 2 eggs. I know that sounds like a lot of vanilla but this recipe needs a little extra moisture and the cookies will taste great., Mix the cookie dough until light and fluffy (about 3 more minutes.), Add 4 teaspoons of Baking Powder and mix., Mix in the 6 cups of flour two cups at a time. Don't over-mix the dough when you are adding the dry ingredients. Mix it only until the flour is incorporated into the dough., After you have added the 6 cups of Flour the dough should be firm but not dry or crumbly. If the dough seems to dry, add a tiny bit of vanilla or milk (start with a teaspoon) and mix again., Roll a handful of the dough out on a prepared surface until it's about 3/8"" thick., Cut out shapes with cookie cutters., Bake in an oven pre-heated to 350 degrees for 6-10 minutes depending on the size of the cookie cutter you used. Do not over-bake! We like thicker sugar cookies so they will hold a good amount of frosting. If you make your cookies on the thick side as we have done in the pictures here, you should cook them 9-10 minutes. They might not look done to you but they are. Take them out of the oven. You don't want them to start browning around the edges the way a Chocolate Chip Cookie would, for example. The cookies should be set and just bet starting to slightly brown around the edges. Over-baking is the prime culprit if you feel your sugar cookies seem dry. If you roll out thinner cookies, or use smaller cookie cutters than the ones we have used here, you should only bake the cookies 6 or 7 minutes., Let your cookies cool and then they are ready for frosting. We use our Best Buttercream Frosting recipe with these Best Sugar Cookies. The frosting is easy to color and tastes so delicious and yummy on these Sugar Cookies.

Cut the butter into 1- to 1 ½-inch pieces and place them in a small bowl. Freeze while you prep the rest of the ingredients., Mix the dry ingredients. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Beat on low until just combined, about 15 seconds., Beat in the butter to make the shortbread dough. Add the butter all at once and beat on low until the dough starts to resemble coarse meal, with pea-sized pieces of butter throughout, about 3 minutes. Increase the mixer to medium and beat until the dough clumps around the paddle and/or sides of the bowl, 1 to 2 minutes. If necessary, use a mixer cover (or throw a kitchen towel over the mixer bowl) while beating to prevent any pieces of dough from shooting out of the bowl., Roll out the shortbread dough. Tip the dough out onto a piece of parchment paper around the size of a half sheet pan and use your hands to shape it into a roughly 6-inch square. Place a second sheet of parchment over the dough, creating a parchment ""sandwich"" with the dough in the middle.Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough between the parchment sheets, working from left to right. Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat every so often—doing so will help prevent the dough from cracking as you roll it. If the parchment starts to wrinkle and leave creases in the dough, pull the sheet loose and smooth it before rolling the dough more. Continue rotating and rolling until you have a 9-inch square of dough around ¼ inch thick., Chill the shortbread dough. Remove the top layer of parchment. Press a bench scraper against the sides of the dough to create straight edges. Transfer the slab of cookie dough, still on the bottom layer of parchment, to a half sheet pan. Cover with the top layer of parchment once more and freeze for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight., Once the dough is chilled and you're ready to bake the cookies, prep the pans for baking. Remove the sheet pan of dough from the refrigerator. Use the overhanging parchment as handles to carefully lift the slab of dough off the sheet pan and onto a cutting board. Peel the top layer of parchment from the slab and use it to line the sheet pan once more. Line a second half sheet pan with a new sheet of parchment paper., Slice and garnish the cookies. Use a paring knife to slice the slab of dough in half lengthwise, then slice each portion in half crosswise. You should have four smaller dough slabs of equal size.Repeat the process with each of the smaller dough slabs until you have 16 (2-inch) square cookies. Place the cookies at least 2 inches apart on the prepared sheet pans. Sprinkle the top of each cookie with a pinch of sugar., Freeze the cookies while you preheat the oven. Chill both sheet pans with the cookies in the freezer while you preheat the oven.Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F., Bake the cookies. Bake one pan at a time (keeping the other pan in the freezer) for 15 to 17 minutes, or until the edges of each cookie are pale golden brown with small hairline cracks visible on their surfaces. Cool the cookies on the pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes, or until the edges and bottoms of the cookies are set and feel firm to the touch.

There is one way where you add the sugar to the yeast and another where you add the sugar to the flour. I have used both ways and they both work for me., Technique 1, In a bowl, add 1 cup of warm water and dry active yeast and let it stand until creamy (about 5 minutes)., In another bowl add flour, salt, and sugar. After 8 minutes take the yeast and give it a mix then add it to the flour mixture, mixing it in with a fork until sticky, add the additional cup of water a little at a time and continue to form it into a ball. Note: You may not need all of the water. Just make sure the dough is a tad bit moist. Add a little bit of flour at a time to get it to a less sticky consistency. Continue on with the steps 1-11 below., Technique 2, In a liquid measuring cup add 1/4 cup of lukewarm water, add the yeast and 2 teaspoons of granulated sugar. Check back in 10 minutes to make sure it has bubbled and foamed up. If it has then add lukewarm water up to the 2 cup mark of the measuring cup. Note: If it didn’t then you need to try another packet / jar of yeast., In a bowl blend the flour and salt, mix well. Next pour the water 1/2 cup at a time into the flour mix using your fork to blend. Continue to add as much of the water/yeast mixture that you need. Please note you may not need all of the water. You want the dough to be just a tad bit moist. Flour your hands and begin to form the round ball. Continue on with the steps 1-11 below., Continue with Steps 1-11 below, Next, sprinkle with a bit more flour and work it with your hands to make a ball. It’s not necessarily kneading per say. You are just rolling and tucking in gently to get a smooth ball, Take the dough and gently mold it into a smooth but firm ball with an elastic feel., Put the dough back into the bowl and cover with a kitchen towel and let it rise. This could take anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour. It all depends on the temperature in the house and the humidity. Since I am in Houston, Texas this takes me about 45 minutes., Once it rises take a little more flour, pat it down and roll it into a ball again., {OPTIONAL} Put the dough back into the bowl and let it rise 1 more time. When you let the bread rise twice it really makes for a better bread but if you are short on time then don’t worry about it., After you are done with all the rising, you will take the dough and put it on the parchment paper that is on a baking tray. The dough should be elongated and oval-shaped, with tapered and rounded (not pointed) ends., Take about 1 tablespoon of olive oil and coat the dough with it. This will make it nice and crunchy on the outside., After you rub it down with olive oil you can sprinkle a bit of sea salt or sesame seeds on top., Next, score the top of the dough with a sharp knife at a 45 degree angle.

Freeze while you prep the rest of the ingredients., In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour ½ cup of the sugar, and the salt. Beat on low until just combined, about 15 seconds. Add the butter all at once and beat on low until the dough starts to resemble coarse meal, with pea-sized pieces of butter throughout, about 3 minutes. Increase the mixer to medium and beat until the dough clumps around the paddle and/or the sides of the bowl, 2 to 3 minutes. If necessary, use a mixer cover or kitchen towel while beating to prevent any pieces of dough from shooting out of the bowl., Tip the dough out onto a piece of parchment paper around the size of a half sheet pan and use your hands to shape it into a roughly 6-inch square. Place a second sheet of parchment paper over the dough, creating a parchment sandwich with the dough in the middle. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough between the parchment sheets, working from left to right. Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat every so often, doing so will prevent the dough from cracking as you roll it. If the parchment starts to wrinkle and leave creases in the dough, pull the sheet loose and smooth it before rolling the dough more. Continue rotating and rolling until you have a 9-inch square of dough around ¼ inch thick., Remove the top layer of parchment. Press a bench scraper against the sides of the dough to create straight edges. Transfer the slab of cookie dough, still on the bottom layer of parchment, to a half sheet pan. Cover with the top layer of parchment once more and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight., Slice and Bake the Cookies:, Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F., Remove the sheet pan of dough from the refrigerator. Use the overhanging parchment as handles to carefully lift the slab of dough off the sheet pan and onto a cutting board. Peel the top layer of parchment from the slab and use it to line the sheet pan once more. Line a second half sheet pan with parchment as well., Use a paring knife to slice the slab of dough in half lengthwise, then slice each portion in half crosswise. You should have four smaller dough slabs of equal size. Repeat the process with each of the smaller dough slabs until you have sixteen 2-inch-square cookies. Place the cookies at least 2 inches apart on the prepared sheet pans. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar evenly over each cookie. The dough should still be cool and firm to the touch. If not, chill both sheet pans in the freezer for at least 10 minutes before baking., Bake one pan at a time (keeping the other pan in the refrigerator) for 15 to 17 minutes, or until the edges of each cookie are pale golden brown with small hairline cracks visible on their surfaces. For straight cookie edges, gently press a bench scraper against the side of each cookie immediately after removing the cookies from the oven.

You can also place them in a zip-top bag and crush them into fine crumbs with a little arm muscle and a rolling pin. You should have about 2 cups (packed) crumbs, or 250g. Pour crumbs into a large bowl., Add the melted butter and stir to combine. The mixture will be thick and quite wet. Try to smash/break up any large chunks., Pour the mixture into an ungreased 8-inch, 9-inch, or 10-inch pie dish, cake pan, springform pan, or square pan. With medium pressure using your hand, pat the crumbs down into the bottom and up the sides to make a compact, thick crust. If the mixture seems really wet and is not forming a nice crust, grind up 2 more Oreos and mix those crumbs in. Tip: You can use a small flat-bottomed measuring cup to help press down the bottom crust and smooth out the surface, but do not pack down too hard. If making a pie, run a spoon around the bottom “corner” where the edge and bottom meet to help make a rounded crust⁠—this helps prevent the crust from falling apart when you cut slices., For a baked dessert, pre-bake this crust per your filling recipe directions. I usually pre-bake for 8–10 minutes at 350°F (177°C). For a no-bake filling such as cookies & cream pie, bake for 10–12 minutes at 350°F (177°C).

Allow cookies to cool completely prior to icing., For the icing, Sift or whisk powdered sugar to remove lumps., Add 3 tablespoons of the milk and the extract, whisking until combined. Continue to add milk until it is the right viscosity. You will want thicker frosting for piping. To test viscosity, run your whisk or a knife through the bowl of frosting- your frosting should slowly move back together until you can’t see any trace of the whisk any longer. This process should take about 6-8 seconds. If the frosting is too thick, it will not pool back together, and if it is too thin, it will pool back together too quickly. Add more milk for a thinner icing and more powdered sugar if your icing becomes too thin., Cover tightly in a tupperware or with a wet paper towel if you are not using it immediately, as frosting will dry out and become clumpy. Whisk occasionally and add more milk if it becomes too thick., When ready to frost your cookies, cover your work space in wax paper. Set out some cookie racks to place your frosted cookies on. To frost, hold each cookie by its rim and dip the face of it directly into the icing. Allow any excess to drip off the sides.

To splatter, I hold my silicone brush parallel to the work surface, draw back slightly at the wrist, and then fling the brush downward, like you’re swatting a fly or hitting a drum.

(or coconut milk for non dairy, I used Native Forest “Simple” brand), 1 tbls fresh lemon juice (or ACV)","Preheat oven to 450° – line baking sheet with a silpat mat or parchment paper., Add lemon juice to 1 Cup measuring cup and then fill up the rest of the way with raw milk (or coconut milk, use full fat). Stir and set aside while you prep dry ingredients., Add cassava flour, baking powder and salt to a medium bowl, whisk to combine., Add shortening to the flour mixture and cut in with a pastry cutter until shortening is incorporated, even and resembles coarse crumbs., Give the buttermilk a stir and then pour into dry ingredients. Using a wooden spoon, stir in buttermilk until dough comes together…use the back of the spoon to press dough together until you have a nice dough . Then, using your hands, gently roll dough ball around the bowl to shape and gather all the dough/flour on the side of the bowl. Dough will initially seem sticky, but will not stay that way., Lightly dust a piece of parchment paper, and flatten dough slightly with the palm of your hands. Dust with a little bit more flour and cover with another piece of parchment paper., IMPORTANT TIP#1: Roll out dough to a thickness of ¾-1″ – no less! This is where you’re going to get the height of the biscuit. If you roll dough out thinner than that, you’ll have flatter biscuits., IMPORTANT TIP#2: Dip your biscuit cutter (I used my mother-in-laws cutters that she gave to me, they are very old, but this set is very similar) into flour and then PRESS STRAIGHT DOWN into the dough..DO NOT TWIST the cutter! If you twist it, you’re in a sense, “sealing” the edge and this will allow for less rising! Tap the cutter in your hand to remove biscuit and place on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, placing each biscuit close together but not quite touching. Gather, re-roll and cut biscuits until all dough is used., IMPORTANT TIP#3: Before placing in the oven, dip your finger into a little bowl of water and slowly wipe over the top of each biscuit, until surface is smooth…one little drop is all you’ll need. More is not better in this case…take your time and do this for each biscuit., Place in oven – depending on the size biscuits you cut (2″, 2 ½” etc…) bake times will vary just a bit. For my 2″ biscuits, (which rose better during the bake than the 2 ½”. ) I started checking at 14 minutes and ended up baking for 18 minutes. Your looking for a nice golden color on top and some golden color on the ridges on the sides…be patient and let that hot oven works it’s magic!, Optional step, but super tasty…once you remove from the oven, and biscuits are warm, brush tops with ghee or butter and watch the color get even better!, Let cool a bit before pulling apart to enjoy…but most certainly ENJOY!!

Then perform your 1st of stretch and folds. Let rest for 30 minutes., Then perform your 2nd set. Let rest for 30 minutes. Then perform your 3rd set. Let rest for 30 minutes. Then perform your 4th and final set. 4 sets of stretch and folds, 30 minutes apart. Here is a video of how to do a stretch and fold. It is easy!, After those stretch and folds are completed, you will let the dough finish its bulk ferment. This means letting the dough rise on the counter for around 5-6 hours total (from 1st set of stretch and folds) if your house is around 72 degrees. It will take more time if it is cooler, or less time if it warmer. Your dough is finished proofing when: it has risen about 75% (not quite doubled in size), has a glossy top and is puffy, with a bubble or two around the edges of the bowl/bucket. It should jiggle a bit as well when you shake it. These are the signs to look for, rather than going off of time. Time is a general notation because the temperature of water you used and air temperature will be different for everyone., Now you'll gently move the dough out of the bowl onto a floured work surface. Let the dough rest there for 10-15 minutes., Then, shape the dough. You can watch the video below to learn how to shape it into a round boule., Once shaped, use a bench scraper to put the dough into a banneton (proofing basket) that has been liberally dusted with rice flour, seam side of the dough facing up (so the top of the dough is what is touching the bottom of banneton) when it is placed in banneton., Cover with a damp cloth, and let rise for a final time, on the counter. This will take about 2 hours, if your house is around 70 degrees. OR you can put the banneton with dough, in a plastic bag or covered with a shower cap (this ensures the dough will not dry out) in the refrigerator and let the final rise happen overnight. The dough can be in the refrigerator for 10-12 hours at this stage., Once your dough has gone through its final rise and has risen slightly and is puffy on top, preheat your oven with dutch oven in it to 450 degrees F. You can test to see if your dough is ready by doing gently pressing a floured thumb into the dough. If it indents and gradually releases, but still holds a finger shape, you're ready! If you press your finger in and the indent doesn't move or release, that means it is overproofed (but still bake it!). If your fingerprint jumps right back up to flat, your dough is underproofed (but still bake it!). Let it ferment in half hour more increments, until ready., Wait until oven is preheated, then place parchment over the top of your dough and flip over, so that the seam side is now on the parchment paper and you are able to score the top of the dough., Score the dough with a bread lame, making sure to go at least 1/2 inch deep in a few spots so that dough can release gases. Otherwise your bread will not rise., Place dough on parchment paper into a dutch oven, and put cover on it. Bake for 20 minutes, covered at 450 degrees F. Then remove cover, turn heat down to 430 degrees F, and bake for 25 more minutes, until bread is golden brown and crackly., Remove from oven and place load on a cooling rack.

We’re putting 3 small pieces of graham cracker in each cookie, so we need 36 pieces of graham cracker from 3 whole sheets. Each quadrant of a graham cracker makes 3 pieces for one cookie. Three sheets = enough pieces for all 12 cookies. (The remaining graham cracker sheet will be crushed and sprinkled over the cookies after baking). Press three small pieces of graham cracker into each dough ball., 8. Refrigerate the cookie dough balls for 30 minutes while you preheat the oven to 350F.., 9. Space 6 cookie dough balls evenly on a large baking sheet, and add a few extra chips on top of each cookie. Bake for 11-13 minutes, until the cookies are starting to turn golden brown around the edges. , 10. Right when the cookies come out of the oven, use your fingers to crush the remaining graham cracker sheet and sprinkle it over the cookies while still warm.

DON'T use a liquid measuring cup or you'll end up with too much flour and rock hard biscuits!, 2) I find it easier to incorporate room-temperature butter into my dry ingredients but then put the bowl with flour/butter back into the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes to chill the mixture. The colder your butter is, the higher your biscuits will end up. If you want to work with cold butter, this step is NOT necessary., 3) Shake the carton of buttermilk before measuring and make sure the buttermilk is COLD! It keeps the butter cold, and you have a lighter, fluffier biscuit., 4) Dust the work surface with All-Purpose flour when rolling and shaping the dough. (Leavening in Self-Rising flour leaves a bitter taste on the outside of the biscuit.)., 5) Cut STRAIGHT DOWN with a sharp biscuit cutter! Do NOT twist the cutter or you'll be sealing the edges of the biscuits and reduce the rise of them. Ditto on using a glass to cut out biscuits: both sides of the cutter need to be open to allow air to exit as you press down. The glass ends up sealing the edges of the biscuit., Directions:., Preheat oven to 450-degrees F., In a very large bowl combine all the dry ingredients: Flour, Baking Powder, Baking Soda, Sugar, Salt, Black Pepper and Cayenne Pepper. Stir well to evenly distribute the ingredients., Drop the cut tablespoons of butter all around the flour mixture. Cut in butter using a pastry cutter until mixture is about the size of peas or very crumbly. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes to allow the butter to become hard; this will aid in having a very flaky biscuit., Add the cheese chunks and chives to the chilled butter/flour mixture. Stir to coat them well with the flour., Stir in buttermilk only until dough holds together very slightly, about 30 seconds. DO NOT OVER STIR! THIS IS THE SECRET TO INCREDIBLY FLUFFY AND LIGHT BISCUITS! The dough should ""hold together"" but still be very lofty and NOT packed down!, Turn dough out onto a floured board, kneading dough a few times (about 3-4 times) and then pat into a 5-inch x 9-inch rectangle; Sprinkle top of dough with a small amount of additional flour and fold into thirds like a letter. Repeat entire process 2 more times, beginning with pressing into a 3/4"" inch-thick dough rectangle again., Press or pat dough into a 1/2 inch thickness on a lightly floured surface; Dip edges of 2.5-inch biscuit cutter into flour and cut out a biscuit.DO NOT TWIST THE CUTTER! JUST PRESS FIRMLY DOWN, ONCE. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, placing biscuits side by side so they touch. Continue with existing dough. With the scraps, very lightly press dough together to form another rectangle and continue cutting out the biscuits. Caution! The MORE you work the dough and manhandle it, the tougher your biscuits will become so work with a very light hand when pushing the dough back together., Brush tops of biscuits lightly with cream., Bake for 14-16 minutes or until biscuits are lightly browned. Take out of oven by sliding the parchment paper with biscuits attached, onto table or counter top. Allow to sit for ONLY 1 minute, and transfer to a wire rack to cool for only a couple of minutes before serving. Caution! Moisture really builds up on the bottom of these biscuits, which is why they only sit on the parchment paper for 1 minute. Cooling on the rack for 2-3 minutes allows the cheese to set enough that it does NOT burn a person's mouth when eating it!, VARIATIONS ON BISCUITS:., 1) Feta-Oregano or Marjoram: Stir 4-8 ounces of crumbled feta cheese and 1 teaspoon of either oregano or marjoram into the chilled butter/flour mixture before adding the buttermilk. Proceed with recipe as directed., 2) Bacon-Cheddar: Stir 6 cooked, drained, cooled and crumbled slices of bacon into the chilled butter/flour mixture along with 1/2 a cup of cubed Cheddar Cheese. Omit chives. Proceed with recipe as directed., 3) Gruyere-Rosemary: Stir in 1 cup of cubed Gruyere cheese and 1/2 tablespoon of fresh, snipped rosemary into the chilled butter/flour mixture. Use 1/4 cup of snipped chives and 1/2 tablespoon of freshly ground black peper. Proceed with recipe as directed., 4) Havarti-Dill: Stir in 1 cup of cubed Havarti cheese with 1 tablespoon of freshly snipped dill into the chilled butter/flour mixture. Omit chives. Proceed with recipe as directed., 5) Pimento Cheese: Stir in 1 cup cubed Sharp Cheddar Cheese with 1-4 ounce jar of DRAINED and patted dry Pimento into the chilled butter/flour mixture. Omit chives. Proceed with recipe as directed., 6) The ONE failure that I had was with Pepperjack Cheese. The actual cheese is too mild to taste in the end results and the remaining hot peppers were too much for the biscuit.

Start by beating the butter in a stand mixer or with a hand mixer. (This batch isn't very big so you will not need to beati the butter very long.)2. Next, add the sugars and oil and continue to beat at medium to high speed. Make sure to scrap down the sides of your bowl and beater often. (There may be some smaller peices of butter that have not been completely incorporated in the batter but that is fine), 3.

Slowly turn the mixer on to low speed and mix until the dry ingredeints are combined well with batter. (There is no need to beat after this time, just slowly until everything looks mixed in well) The dough will feel a bit soft but it defeinitely should not feel dry. 5. Preheat the oven to 350° and scoop the sugar cookie dough into 12-14 large balls and place on a small pan or baking sheet.

Divide the cookie dough balls onto 2 half sheet baking pans. Line them with parchment or spray. 7. With an item with a large flat bottom (i use my drinking glass), lightly press down the dough balls. You do not want to press them down too far or your cookies will be too flat and not stay as soft and chewy. This step is just to ensure they have an even perfect bake while still maintaining a thick cookie.8. Bake for 10 minutes and no longer. If you oven runs hotter, I reccommend 9 minutes.9. Take the cookies out of the oven. They can stay on the pan until completely cool.10. Once the cookies are cooled, you can frost them!, To Make the Buttercream:, 1. While the cookies are baking or cooling, start beating the butter in your mixer until fluffy. Remember to pause and scrap down the sides of the bowl again.2. Add the powdered sugar, milk, and extract on low speed until combined and then beat for several minutes until light, airy, and there are no clumps. 3.

Then, fold the dough in half again by bringing one side over the other.

You can use a milk wash in place of the extra butter.

Transfer the square biscuits to a lined baking sheet with a little bit of space between each biscuit. *You can freeze the biscuits at this point (when baking from frozen, adjust the oven temp to 375 degrees F and bake for 30-35 minutes)., Brush the biscuits with melted butter or a bit of plant milk.

Rub the inside of a cast iron skillet with a bit of vegetable oil or melted shortening. This will create a deliciously crispy bottom on the biscuits. (*You can also bake these in a baking dish. See note below.), Cut the butter into small 1/2-inch pieces, put them on a plate or in a bowl, and pop it into the freezer for about 10 minutes. You want the butter to be very cold, but not frozen., Put the cake flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor OR in a mixing bowl. Pulse a few times to blend, OR stir with a wire whisk., Add the butter and pulse 3 or 4 times, just until the butter is incorporated enough for the mixture to look like coarse crumbs. Alternatively, use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the dry ingredients. You can also just use your fingers; rub the butter into the dry ingredients just until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. (See photos above for guidance.), If you've been using a food processor, dump the mixture into a mixing bowl. Set a small bowl of flour nearby just incase you need it later., Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in the buttermilk. Use a spoon or rubber spatula to gently mix the ingredients until a shaggy dough begins to form. Then, use your hands to gently knead the dough until it holds together completely. (See notes below about under and over working the dough.), Dump the dough out onto a clean work surface. Pat or roll it out into a rectangle that’s about 1-inch thick. If it's really sticking to the work surface, sprinkle with a bit of flour. Use only enough flour to keep the dough from sticking., Fold one side of the dough to the center, then fold the whole thing over again, like you're folding a letter. (See photos above for guidance.), Give the dough a quarter turn and roll or pat it out into a 1-inch thick rectangle again. Repeat the folding process, give the dough a quarter turn, and repeat the folding process once more., Roll or pat the dough back out into a 1-inch thick rectangle and use a 3 1/2-inch biscuit cutter to cut out the biscuits. As you cut them out, set them on a plate. Reroll the dough as necessary, cutting out biscuits until you have 8-10 biscuits., Set the plate of biscuits in the freezer for 10 minutes. Then, remove the biscuits from the plate and place them in the cast iron pan (or baking dish). Set the biscuits very close together inside the pan so that their sides are touching. This will help them rise while they bake., Brush the tops of the biscuits with 2 tbsp (1oz/ 28g) melted butter and place in the oven. Bake for 18-20 minutes, until their tops are golden brown. Biscuits are best served immediately, while still warm, drizzled with honey or spread with jam.","[('butter', 6.0, 'ounces'), ('butter', 1.0, 'tablespoons'), ('flour', 250.0, 'grams'), ('flour', 94.0, 'grams'), ('baking powder', 8.0, 'grams'), ('baking soda', 1.5, 'grams'), ('salt', 1.5, 'teaspoons'), ('sugar', 25.0, 'grams'), ('buttermilk', 236.0, 'milliliters')]"

You should get 16 cookies in total.Place them onto a baking sheet lined with baking/greaseproof paper, cover tightly with cling film and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.Tip: The cookies will be even better if you chill them overnight before baking., Adjust the oven rack to the middle position, pre-heat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC) and line another baking sheet with baking/greaseproof paper.Tip: You will bake the cookies in several batches, so you can line 2-3 baking sheets if you have them on hand. Otherwise, just re-use the same baking sheet, but make sure to cool it completely before you place the next batch of unbaked cookies onto it., In batches (at most, 6-8 at a time), place the chilled cookie dough balls on the lined baking sheet, leaving plenty of space between them (about 2 inches/5 cm), as they will spread out during baking., Bake the cookies at 350ºF (180ºC) for 12-15 minutes in total, depending on your preferred cookie texture and consistency (a shorter time will give you very gooey cookies, a longer baking time will give you more fudgy cookies). They should be light golden on top and golden brown around the edges when done.At the 8-9 minute mark, take the baking sheet out of the oven, tap/bang it 5-7 times onto the kitchen counter, and place a few pieces of the reserved chocolate on top of each cookie.Return the cookies to the oven and bake until done. You can tap the baking sheet again at 2-minute intervals until the cookies are baked, to give them an extra rippled, crinkled appearance, if you wish.Tip 1: Tapping the cookie sheet on the kitchen counter helps the cookies to flatten, thus giving them their characteristic shape and appearance. Omit the tapping if you want thicker cookies.Tip 2: Adding the reserved chopped chocolate to the tops of the cookies halfway through baking will give you those gorgeous glossy puddles of melted chocolate., Immediately out of the oven, you can correct the shape of the cookies into a more evenly round one. To do this, use a round cookie cutter slightly larger than the cookie diameter to nudge the cookies into shape., Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely., Repeat the baking instructions for the remaining balls of cookie dough, then once all the cookies are baked and cooled, sprinkle with flaky sea salt (optional) before serving., Storage:The gluten free chocolate chip cookies keep well in a closed container at room temperature for about 1 week. Note that the cookies will get a bit softer and chewier with time.Alternatively, you can store raw, unbaked balls of cookie dough in an airtight container in the fridge for about 1 week, or in the freezer for 1-2 months.

Continue stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan for 1-3 minutes as they deepen to a bronze. Use your senses to guide you: you should see the deep golden bits on the bottom of the pan (think the color of golden pancakes) and smell the most delicious nutty, caramelized fragrance. Once the bits are a bronzed immediately take off of the heat and pour into a heat-safe bowl to cool. Be sure to scrape all of the bronzed milk solids into the bowl., Brown butter can be used once cooled or stored in an air-tight in the fridge for a later date.","[('butter', 8.0, 'tablespoons')]"

Stamp out biscuits using approximately a 2-inch cutter, or cut it into a 2-inch squares with your knife. Don’t wiggle the cutter or use a rocking motion with your knife. It will ruin your layers. Just stamp or slice straight up and down. Try to stamp out biscuits as close to each other, because the ones you make from re-rolled scraps tend to not rise as high. Gather any scraps together, and stamp again. Dust the bottoms off with a dry pastry brush to remove extra flour. Place biscuits on the tray., Place the whole tray in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. This will ensure the butter is cold, which forms steam pockets and creates height in the oven. Pop it into the oven until puffed and lightly golden brown on the tops, about 11-12 minutes. The bottoms will be darker. Place biscuits on a cooling rack. Serve while still warm, or warm them up again in the microwave. Keep extras in the freezer and warm them in the oven or the microwave.","[('all-purpose flour', 2.0, 'cups'), ('baking powder', 2.5, 'teaspoons'), ('kosher salt', 0.5, 'teaspoons'), ('unsalted butter', 5.0, 'tablespoons'), ('buttermilk', 0.75, 'cups'), ('honey', 3.0, 'tablespoons'), ('bacon', 3.0, 'strips'), ('chives', 3.0, 'tablespoons')]"

To make the biscuits: Remove butter from freezer and let thaw briefly. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and scallions in a large bowl. Using the largest holes on a box grater, grate the butter into the flour mixture. Use your fingers to mix the butter into the flour until all pieces are coated and no lumps larger than peas remain., In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together Greek yogurt and milk.

Continue to cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until the roux turns slightly darker., Pour the milk in a slow stream over the sausage and roux, stirring as you go, until incorporated.

Next, beat in egg and vanilla on high speed for 2 full minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. The butter may separate; that’s ok., Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, and beat on low speed until combined. The cookie dough will be quite thick and slightly sticky. Divide dough in half and place each onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Wrap each up tightly and pat down to create a disc shape. Chill discs for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory for this cookie dough. I always chill mine overnight., Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.) Set aside., Remove 1 disc of chilled cookie dough from the refrigerator. Generously flour a work surface, as well as your hands and the rolling pin. Roll out disc until 1/4-inch thick. Tips for rolling—the dough may crack and be crumbly as you roll. What’s helpful is picking it up and rotating it as you go. Additionally, you can use your fingers to help meld the cracking edges back together. The first few rolls are always the hardest since the dough is so stiff, but re-rolling the scraps is much easier. Cut into shapes. Place shapes 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Re-roll dough scraps until all the dough is shaped. Repeat with remaining disc of dough., Bake cookies for about 9-10 minutes. If your cookie cutters are smaller than 4 inches, bake for about 8 minutes. If your cookie cutters are larger than 4 inches, bake for about 11 minutes. My oven has hot spots and yours may too—so be sure to rotate the pan once during bake time. Keep in mind that the longer the cookies bake, the harder and crunchier they’ll be. For soft gingerbread cookies, follow my suggested bake times., Allow cookies to cool for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet. Transfer to cooling rack to cool completely. Once completely cool, decorate as desired., Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.","[('flour', 440.0, 'g'), ('baking soda', 1.0, 'teaspoon'), ('salt', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('ginger', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('cinnamon', 1.0, 'tablespoon'), ('allspice', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('cloves', 0.5, 'teaspoon'), ('butter', 145.0, 'g'), ('brown sugar', 150.0, 'g'), ('molasses', 160.0, 'ml'), ('egg', 1.0, None), ('vanilla extract', 1.0, 'teaspoon')]"

You can serve it room temperature or chill it in the fridge., Make the shortcake. In a large bowl, add 3 cups flour, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and 2 tablespoons baking powder. Whisk it together., Use a knife to chop 3/4 cup COLD butter into small chunks., Add the butter to the flour mixture and use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the flour. See photos. You want to end up with a crumbly mixture and pieces of butter about the size of a pea., In a small bowl or glass measuring cup, add 3/4 cup COLD buttermilk**. Whisk the large egg into the buttermilk., Add the buttermilk/egg mixture to the flour and use a rubber spatula to stir it together and create a shaggy dough. It's ok if all the flour is not incorporated., Cover your hands with flour and knead the dough a few times right there in the bowl, smashing in any loose flour with your hands. If it is too dry to come together, add 1 tablespoon cold buttermilk or 1 tablespoon ice water to get it to come together., Turn the dough out onto a floured surface (I love my pastry cloth). Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a rectangle about 9x13 inches, it doesn't have to be exact. Fold the dough in half, then in quarters, then again. Pat the dough out with your hands to make a smooth top, and use the rolling pin if necessary to roll it gently into a rectangle about 1 and 1/4 inch thick., Dip a 2 and 1/2 inch biscuit cutter into flour and use it to cut the dough. Do not twist the biscuit cutter, it inhibits rising in the oven. Just push straight down., Re-roll the scraps and repeat., Place the shortcake in a buttered cast iron skillet or greased 9x9 inch square baking pan. I prefer to make them in a pan that has sides; this helps the shortcakes rise upward instead of falling on their sides in the oven. You want to place the shortcakes snuggly together, either touching or about 1/2 inch apart. They will help each other rise., If you have time, I highly recommend freezing the whole pan of prepared shortcake for about 20 minutes. Cold dough going into a hot oven is how you get perfect flaky layers. While you freeze the dough, preheat the oven to 425 for at least 20 minutes., Just before putting them in the oven, brush the top of each shortcake with buttermilk or heavy cream. This will help them brown. Sprinkle generously with sugar (I like chunky raw sugar for a nice crunch)., Bake at 425 degrees F for about 18-22 minutes. You will know they are done when the tops are a deep golden brown, the edges of the biscuits have firmed to the touch, and the bottoms are starting to brown. If you still can't tell, gently split one of the shortcakes and lift it up to see the center. If it is at all gooey, put it back in the oven. If they are not done but the tops are getting too brown, top with foil for the last few minutes of baking., Meanwhile, make the whipped cream. In a large bowl or stand mixer, add 2 cups of cream, 1/3 cup powdered sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat on high speed for 2-5 minutes, depending on the power of your mixer. You will know it is ready when the cream has thickened, you can see peaks forming, and when you lift the beaters out they hold their shape in a nice curl. Keep refrigerated if you are not ready to serve right away., Assemble the shortcakes while they are still warm: split a shortcake in half, top with strawberries and whipped cream, top with the other half, then top with more strawberries and whipped cream., Make ahead: You can make and freeze the unbaked shortcakes once they are shaped.

But both confectioners sugar and cake flour can be pretty lumpy and really benefit from sifting., In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar, and salt together on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 or 4 minutes. Start slow so the powdered sugar doesn't fly up too much. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Add the vanilla and beat to incorporate., Turn the mixer down to low and add the flour, mixing until just barely combined., Roll the dough into balls about 1"" diameter and place about 2"" apart on the baking sheet. These cookies will spread a bit, so they do need a bit of breathing room. I found this dough to be really soft and sticky, so I rolled all the balls first, and then went back and made the indentations. I also wet my fingers with cool water to help prevent the dough from sticking to them., You can just make a simple indentation for regular thumbprint cookies, or you can make a heart-shape like I did by making two overlapping indentations with your fingers. I sharpened the point of the heart with the spoon I used to add the jam., Fill each indentation with the jam of your choice – stir it first to smooth it out. If you'd like it really smooth, you can use a food mill or sieve to remove the seeds. As the cookies bake and spread out, the jam will flatten out a bit as well, so you'll want to slightly over-fill them. You don't want the jam to overflow, but it should be a bit rounded rather than level with the top of the cookie., Bake for about 10-12 minutes, until lightly golden brown around the edges, rotating the baking sheet halfway through the baking time.

Add the rinsed rice and continue boiling, reducing heat as necessary to prevent overflow, for 40 minutes to 55 minutes, until the rice is pleasantly tender but still offers a light resistance to the bite. Remove from heat, drain the rice and return the rice to pot. Cover and let the rice rest for 10 minutes, then remove the lid, stir in 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and set aside., Meanwhile, to roast the sweet potatoes: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.

Top with the crumbled feta, green onion and dried cranberries., If you’re serving the salad immediately, go ahead and drizzle most of the dressing on top (you probably won’t use it all). Gently toss to combine, and let the salad rest for a few minutes so the rice has time to absorb some of the dressing. Serve., If you’re planning to have leftovers, divide the salad into portions and store the dressing separately.

Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat once more until combined., Sift in the dry ingredients: all-purpose flour, cocoa powder and salt.

Remove the tea towels and continue to mix for another 30 seconds. The dough will be ready when all the flecks of flour disappear and it begins to clump around the mixer., Divide the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap. Press the dough down and wrap it in plastic wrap. Transfer to the fridge to chill for 1 hour or up to 1 day., Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove the first sheet of dough from the fridge. If the dough is too stiff/cold to roll out, let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes, until it’s rollable. Flour your work surface and rolling pin. Roll the dough out to a 1/4-inch thickness. Using your cookie cutter, stamp out cookies. Transfer the cookies to a parchment-lined baking sheet and place in the freezer to chill for 15 minutes (this helps the cookies keep their shape when baked). Repeat the rolling out and stamping out process with the second sheet of dough. Repeat chilling process too., Bake the cookies, one baking sheet at a time, for 8 to 10 minutes, until the center of the cookie no longer looks wet.

Stencil the outsides of the hearts and allow to dry completely., Add a teaspoon more of water to the royal icing and mix until it’s a much looser consistency, adding more water, as needed. Add the royal icing to the center of the cookies, spreading it around, until it reaches the outside stencil, using a toothpick.

Keep the rolled dough chilled if you are not cutting and baking right away. The dough will be more challenging to work with the warmer it is., Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with a piece of parchment paper. Put the cookie sheet back in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes to chill again.

Add in the vanilla extract and whip until it's white. No need to mix for longer than 5 minutes., The icing is pretty thick at this stage so we want to thin it down by adding water and mixing on low speed until we get our desired consistency., Add water 1 teaspoon at a time until a ribbon of royal icing goes flat in 15 seconds. This is a good consistency for dipping cookies, but not too thin to have it run off the cookies., In a small bowl, color 1/3 of your royal icing hot pink and light pink or as many colors as you desire., Drizzle the pink and red icing over the top of the white icing., Use a toothpick or skewer and drag up and down the icing creating a marbled effect., Dip your cooled sugar cookies onto the surface, making sure to get the edges of your cookie dipped evenly. Pull straight up and tap off any excess icing. Pro Tip: I like to let it drip for a second and then twist it to catch the tail of the icing, keeping the edge of my cookie clean., Wipe the cookie edges clean if any icing dripped over the edge. Place the frosted cookie on a wire rack or tray with parchment paper to dry, and watch for drips of royal icing., There may be bubbles in the royal icing, use a straight pin or scribe to gently pop the bubbles. Then give the cookie a gentle shake to even out the frosting., For the best results let cookies dry completely before packaging. This could take up to 16-24 hours for the icing to dry, depending on your environment. The top dries quickly but under the top shell it will still be runny and it can crack if you touch the cookies too soon. Pro-tip: Place the tray of freshly dipped cookies back in the warm (not on) oven with the door open. The warm air from the cooling oven will dry the top of the cookies faster to avoid smudging the royal icing., The cookies are shelf stable and will stay fresh if they are stored in an airtight container.

Mix well with a fork or wire whisk to combine. Add this flour mixture to the large bowl containing the previous ingredients., Knead, With your hands, mix everything together. Once everything is mixed well add the remaining flour, one cup at a time, mixing after each addition. You will end up with a dough which is somewhat greasy, not stiff, and with which you are able to form a ball that will keep its shape. You may need to add more sifted flour, in order to get your cookie dough to resemble the consistency pictured. If you do add more flour, add 1/4 cup at a time. Be sure to knead the dough very well, and for several minutes. This will ensure that all of the oil is incorporated into the flour., Shape cookies, Taking one tablespoon of dough at a time (use 30 grams, per cookie) form oval shaped cookies which you will flatten slightly so that they are approximately 1 centimeter thick. When shaping your cookies, knead the dough in your hand, make a ball, and then turn that ball into an oval shaped cookie which is about 2 1/2 inches long. Place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving a one inch space between cookies. Using a fork, make a few indentations on top of each cookie., Bake in middle rack of oven for 10 – 15 minutes until the bottoms are golden brown., Cool, Remove from oven, let rest on baking sheet for about 1 – 2 minutes and then place cookies on cooling rack., Combine, Meanwhile, combine the crushed walnuts with the sesame seeds and mix well., Soak, Once your cookies are fully cooled, (we actually like to let them cool overnight) prepare your syrup. Heat your honey in a small saucepan. Once the honey has liquefied (which will happen when the honey is brought to a boil) carefully add 2 tablespoons of boiling water. Skim off any foam which may develop on surface of honey. Reduce heat to a very low simmer., Sprinkle, Prepare a sheet of parchment paper near the stovetop. This is where you will place your honey dipped cookies. Sprinkle some of the walnut-sesame seed mixture onto the paper (this will keep the bottoms of the cookie from sticking to the parchment)., Drizzle, Place as many cookies as will fit into the saucepan containing the honey. Let them soak for about 30 – 45 seconds. Depending upon the size of your saucepan, you may need to occasionally push down on them gently with a spoon if they are floating in the honey, in order to soak the entire cookie. Alternatively, you can use a spoon to carefully drizzle some honey on top of the cookies. You can also carefully flip them over. Remove from honey with a slotted spoon, place on parchment paper and while still hot sprinkle some of the walnut-sesame seed mixture over the top., Cool, Let cool.
